Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Consolidated net income (including both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $912.0 million, compared to a net loss of $587.1 million in 2001. The 2001 results include a restatement of previously reported financial results related to the life settlement business of CNA, as described below. Net income for 2002 included a loss from discontinued operations at CNA of $31.0 million or $0.17 per share of Loews common stock, compared to income from discontinued operations of $9.4 million or $0.05 per share of Loews common stock in the comparable period of the prior year. Results for 2002 also included a charge for accounting changes of $39.6 million or $0.21 per share of Loews common stock, related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, compared to a charge of $53.3 million or $0.27 per share of Loews common stock in the comparable period of the prior year, related to accounting for derivative instruments at CNA. Consolidated net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002, which excludes net investment gains (losses), discontinued operations and the effects of accounting changes, was $1,099.3 million, compared to a loss of $1,333.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net operating income (loss) is calculated by deducting net investment gains or losses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (after deduction of related income taxes and minority interests), from net income (loss). Analysts following the Companys stock have advised the Company that such information is meaningful in assisting them in measuring the performance of its insurance subsidiaries. In addition, it is used in managements discussion of the results of operations for the insurance related segments due to the significance of the amount of net investment gains or losses. Net operating income (losses) is also a common measure throughout the insurance industry. Net realized investment gains (losses) are excluded from this operating measure because investment gains or losses related to CNAs available for sale investment portfolio are largely discretionary, are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not an indication of trends in operations. Net operating income attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended December 31, 2002, which excludes net investment (losses) gains, discontinued operations and the effects of accounting changes, was $963.9 million, compared to a loss of $1,333.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $140.7 million or $3.50 per share. Consolidated net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 was $261.3 million, compared to $191.0 million in 2001. Consolidated net operating income for the 2002 fourth quarter, which excludes net investment losses and discontinued operations, was $285.0 million, compared to a net operating loss of $47.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net income attributable to Loews common stock for the 2002 fourth quarter was $224.4 million or $1.21 per share, compared to $191.0 million or $0.99 per share in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income in the 2002 fourth quarter includes net investment losses attributable to Loews common stock of $24.2 million, compared to gains of $235.5 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net operating income attributable to Loews common stock for the 2002 fourth quarter, which excludes net investment losses and discontinued operations, was $248.6 million, compared to a net operating loss of $47.2 million in the comparable period of the prior year. Net income attributable to Carolina Group Stock for the 2002 fourth quarter was $36.9 million or $0.92 per share. 29 CNAs Life Settlement Contract Accounting As a result of a routine review of CNAs periodic filings by the Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Company has restated its financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 as well as its interim financial statements for the first three quarters of 2002 and all interim periods of 2001. The restated financial statements reflect an adjustment to the Companys historical accounting for CNAs investment in life settlement contracts and the related revenue recognition. CNAs historical accounting was to record an asset for the amount paid to acquire the life settlement contract along with other direct acquisition costs, and to recognize revenue over the period the contract was held. The SEC concluded that the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Technical Bulletin ("FTB") 85 4 "Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance" should have been applied to CNAs investment in life settlement contracts. Under FTB 85 4, the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the policy. Amounts paid to purchase these contracts that are in excess of the cash surrender value, at the date of purchase, are expensed immediately. Periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums, necessary to keep the underlying policy in force are expensed as incurred and included in other operating expense. Revenue is recognized and included in other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the life insurance policy underlying the life settlement contract matures. The adjustment related to life settlement contracts increased (decreased) previously reported results of operations by $2.0 and $(28.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity reflects a decrease in earnings retained in the business of $193.9 million as of January 1, 2000. Classes of Common Stock The issuance of Carolina Group Stock has resulted in a two class common stock structure for Loews Corporation. Carolina Group Stock, commonly called a tracking stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to as the Carolina Group. The principal assets and liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group are (a) the Companys 100% stock ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc.; (b) notional, intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group ($2.4 billion outstanding at December 31, 2002), bearing interest at the annual rate of 8.0% and, subject to optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021; and (c) any and all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or related to tobacco or tobacco related businesses. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding Carolina Group Stock represents a 23.01% economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group. The Loews Group consists of all the Companys assets and liabilities other than the 23.01% economic interest represented by the outstanding Carolina Group Stock, and includes as an asset the notional, intergroup debt of the Carolina Group. The existence of separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions where the interests of the holders of Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary duties, the Companys board of directors could, in its sole discretion, from time to time, make determinations or implement policies that affect disproportionately the groups or the different classes of stock. For example, Loewss board of directors may decide to reallocate assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows between groups, without the consent of shareholders. The board of directors would not be required to select the option that would result in the highest value for holders of Carolina Group Stock. As a result of the flexibility provided to Loewss board of directors, it might be difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of the Carolina Group based on the Carolina Groups past performance. The creation of the Carolina Group and the issuance of Carolina Group Stock does not change the Companys ownership of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.s status as a separate legal entity. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are notional groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets of assets and liabilities of each such group as described above. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal entities and the attribution of assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or the Carolina Group does not affect title to the assets or responsibility for the liabilities. 30 Holders of the Companys common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in Loews Corporation. Parent Company The Company is a holding company and derives substantially all of its cash flow from its subsidiaries, principally Lorillard. The Company relies upon its invested cash balances and distributions from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to its stockholders. The ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA (see Liquidity and Capital Resources CNA, below), laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of the Companys subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over the claims of the Company and its creditors and stockholders. At December 31, 2002, the book value per share of Loews Common Stock was $61.68, compared to $49.24 at December 31, 2001. The increase in book value per share of Loews Common Stock is primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of the Carolina Group Stock in February 2002 and the net economic interest attributable to the Loews Common Stock in the notional intergroup debt receivable from the Carolina Group, net income for 2002 and an increase in the Companys unrealized gains on available for sale investments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, managements estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. The accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the Companys financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations or equity. Insurance Reserves Insurance reserves are established for both short and long duration insurance contracts. Short duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long duration contracts typically include traditional life insurance and long term care products and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality and morbidity as well as assumptions about expected investment returns. The inherent risks associated with the reserving process are discussed below, in Reserves Estimates and Uncertainties. Additionally, a review of Results of Operations for CNAs segment results, Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort and Asbestos Reserves and Second Quarter 2001 Reserve Strengthening sections that follow is necessary to understand the sensitivity of managements estimate. Reinsurance Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported as a receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of 31 periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, managements experience and current economic conditions. Further information on reinsurance is provided in the Reinsurance section that follows. Tobacco Litigation Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages. On July 14, 2000, the jury in Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. awarded a total of $145.0 billion in punitive damages against all defendants, including $16.3 billion against Lorillard. The judgment also provides that the jurys awards bear interest at the rate of 10% per year. Lorillard remains of the view that the Engle case should not have been certified as a class action. Lorillard believes that class certification in the Engle case is inconsistent with the majority of federal and state court decisions which have held that mass smoking and health claims are inappropriate for class treatment. Lorillard has challenged the class certification, as well as numerous other legal errors that it believes occurred during the trial. The Florida Third District Court of Appeal heard argument in defendants appeal on November 6, 2002. The Court of Appeal took the appeal under advisement. The Company and Lorillard believe that an appeal of these issues on the merits should prevail. Lorillard believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against it. To the extent the Company is a defendant in any of the lawsuits, the Company believes that it is not a proper defendant in these matters and has moved or plans to move for dismissal of all such claims against it. While Lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and, therefore, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that the Companys results of operations, cash flows and its financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation. Valuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities The Company classifies its holdings of fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) and equity securities, which are held principally by insurance subsidiaries, as available for sale, and are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity, net of applicable deferred income taxes and participating policyholders and minority interest. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which are included in investment income. The Companys investment portfolio is subject to market declines below book value that may be other than temporary. CNA has an Impairment Committee, which reviews its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis with ongoing analysis as new information becomes available. Any decline that is determined to be other than temporary is recorded as an impairment loss in the period in which the determination occurred. See "Investments CNA" and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for information related to the Companys impairment charges. Securities in the parent companys investment portfolio that are not part of its cash management activities are classified as trading securities in order to reflect the Companys investment philosophy. These investments are carried at fair value with the net unrealized gain or loss included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 32 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT CNA Insurance operations are conducted by subsidiaries of CNA Financial Corporation ("CNA"). CNA is a 90% owned subsidiary of the Company. CNA conducts its operations through five operating groups: Standard Lines, Specialty Lines and CNA Re (these groups comprise the Companys property and casualty segment); Group Operations and Life Operations. In addition to these five operating segments, certain other activities are reported in the Other Insurance segment. The Other Insurance segment consists of losses and expenses related to centralized adjusting and settlement of asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims ("APMT"), certain run off insurance operations, interest expense on corporate debt, e Business initiatives, and intercompany eliminations. These segments reflect the way CNA manages its operations and makes business decisions. Run off insurance operations consist of personal insurance, entertainment insurance, agriculture insurance, group reinsurance and other financial lines as well as the direct financial guarantee business underwritten by CNAs insurance affiliates and other insurance run off operations. Run off insurance operations also include assumed business underwritten through a managing general agent, IOA Global, which consists primarily of certain accident and health coverages ("IGI Program"). During 2002, CNA underwent management changes and strategic realignment. These events have changed the way CNA manages its operations and makes business decisions and, therefore, necessitated a change in CNAs reportable segments. CNA Trust, a limited operations bank specializing in 401(k) plan administration, and Institutional Markets, which provides guaranteed return investment products for qualified and non qualified institutional buyers, was transferred from Life Operations to Group Operations. Group Reinsurance, the business which assumes reinsurance from unaffiliated entities on group life, accident and health products and excess medical risk coverages for self funded employers, was transferred from Group Operations to Other Insurance to be included as part of run off insurance operations. The Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort and Asbestos ("APMT") Reserves related to assumed reinsurance, along with the assumed business underwritten through a managing general agent, IOA Global, which consists primarily of certain accident and health coverages, was transferred from CNA Re to Other Insurance. The U.S. zone of Global business, which primarily offers international insurance to U.S. based corporations and U.S. insurance to foreign corporations, was transferred from Specialty Lines to Standard Lines. The consolidated operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 were significantly impacted by the second quarter 2001 prior year reserve strengthening, WTC event, and restructuring and other related charges. A discussion of these items, along with CNAs current terrorism exposure and description of reserves is presented below. World Trade Center Event During the third quarter of 2001, CNA recorded estimated incurred losses of $468.0 million pretax, net of reinsurance, related to the World Trade Center disaster and related events ("WTC event"). The loss estimate was based on a total industry loss of $50.0 billion and included all lines of insurance. This estimate took into account CNAs substantial reinsurance agreements, including its catastrophe reinsurance program and corporate reinsurance programs. CNA has closely monitored reported losses as well as the collection of reinsurance on WTC event claims. As of December 31, 2002, CNA believes its recorded reserves, net of reinsurance, for the WTC event are adequate. 33 The following table provides managements estimate of losses related to the WTC event on a gross basis (before reinsurance) and a net basis (after reinsurance) on CNAs operating segments: Pretax Net of Pretax Aggregate Total Tax and Gross Net Reinsurance Pretax Minority Year Ended December 31, 2001 Losses Impact (a) Benefit Impact Interest (In millions) Standard Lines $ 375.0 $ 185.0 $ 108.0 $ 77.0 $ 44.0 Specialty Lines 214.0 30.0 12.0 18.0 11.0 CNA Re 662.0 410.0 139.0 271.0 154.0 Total Property and Casualty 1,251.0 625.0 259.0 366.0 209.0 Group Operations 235.0 53.0 53.0 31.0 Life Operations 75.0 22.0 22.0 12.0 Other Insurance 87.0 27.0 27.0 15.0 Total $1,648.0 $ 727.0 $ 259.0 $ 468.0 $ 267.0 (a) Pretax impact of the WTC event before the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties. The pretax net impact includes $85.0 of reinstatement and additional premiums. Second Quarter 2001 Prior Year Reserve Strengthening During the second quarter of 2001, CNA noted the continued emergence of adverse loss experience across several lines of business related to prior years, which are discussed in further detail below. CNA completed a number of reserve studies during the second quarter of 2001 for many of its lines of business, including those in which these adverse trends were noted. The second quarter 2001 prior year reserve strengthening and related items comprising the amounts noted above are detailed by segment in the following table: Standard Specialty Other Year Ended December 31, 2001 Lines Lines CNA Re Insurance Total (In millions) Net reserve strengthening excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty: APMT $1,197.0 $1,197.0 Non APMT $ 523.0 $ 407.0 $ 571.0 93.0 1,594.0 Total 523.0 407.0 571.0 1,290.0 2,791.0 Pretax benefit from corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty on accident year 1999 (197.0) (26.0) (223.0)* Accrual for insurance related assessments 48.0 48.0 Net reserve strengthening and related accruals 374.0 407.0 545.0 1,290.0 2,616.0 Change in estimate of premium accruals 632.0 (13.0) (3.0) 616.0 Reduction of related commission accruals (50.0) (50.0) Net premium and related accrual reductions 582.0 (13.0) (3.0) 566.0 Total pretax second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening and other related accruals $ 956.0 $ 407.0 $ 532.0 $1,287.0 $3,182.0 Total after tax and minority interest second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening and other related accruals $ 540.0 $ 239.0 $ 301.0 $ 729.0 $1,809.0 * $500.0 of ceded losses reduced by $230.0 of ceded premiums and $47.0 of interest charges. 34 With respect to environmental and mass tort reserves, commencing in 2000 and continuing into the first and second quarters of 2001, CNA received a number of new reported claims, some of which involved declaratory judgment actions premised on court decisions purporting to expand insurance coverage for pollution claims. In these decisions, several courts adopted rules of insurance policy interpretation which established joint and several liability for insurers consecutively on a risk during a period of alleged property damage; and in other instances adopted interpretations of the "absolute pollution exclusion," which weakened its effectiveness in most circumstances. In addition to receiving new claims and declaratory judgment actions premised upon these unfavorable legal precedents, these court decisions also impacted CNAs pending pollution and mass tort claims and coverage litigation. During the spring of 2001, CNA reviewed specific claims and litigation, as well as general trends, and concluded reserve strengthening in this area was necessary. In the area of mass torts, several well publicized verdicts arising out of bodily injury cases related to allegedly toxic mold led to a significant increase in mold related claims in 2000 and the first half of 2001. CNAs reserve increase in the second quarter of 2001 was caused in part by this increased area of exposure. With respect to other court cases and how they might affect CNAs reserves and reasonable possible losses, the following should be noted. State and federal courts issue numerous decisions each year, which potentially impact losses and reserves in both a favorable and unfavorable manner. Examples of favorable developments include decisions to allocate defense and indemnity payments in a manner so as to limit carriers obligations to damages taking place during the effective dates of their policies; decisions holding that injuries occurring after asbestos operations are completed are subject to the completed operations aggregate limits of the policies; and decisions ruling that carriers loss control inspections of their insureds premises do not give rise to a duty to warn third parties to the dangers of asbestos. Examples of unfavorable developments include decisions limiting the application of the "absolute pollution" exclusion; and decisions holding carriers liable for defense and indemnity of asbestos and pollution claims on a joint and several basis. Throughout 2000 and into 2001, CNA experienced significant increases in new asbestos bodily injury claims. In light of this development, CNA formed the view that payments for asbestos claims could be higher in future years than previously estimated. Moreover, in late 2000 through mid 2001, industry sources such as rating agencies and actuarial firms released analyses and studies commenting on the increase in claim volumes and other asbestos liability developments. For example, A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best") released a study in May 2001 increasing its ultimate asbestos reserve estimate 62.5% from $40.0 to $65.0 billion, citing an unfunded insurance industry reserve shortfall of $33.0 billion. In June 2001, Tillinghast raised its asbestos ultimate exposure from $55.0 to $65.0 billion for the insurance industry and its estimate of the ultimate/remaining asbestos liability for all industries was raised to $200.0 billion. Also in the 2000 to 2001 time period, a number of significant asbestos defendants filed for bankruptcy, increasing the likelihood that excess layers of insurance coverage could be called upon to indemnify policyholders and creating the potential that novel legal doctrines could be employed, which could accelerate the time when such indemnification payments could be due. These developments led CNA to the conclusion that its asbestos reserves required strengthening. The non APMT adverse reserve development in 2001 was the result of analyses of several lines of business. This development related principally to commercial insurance coverages including automobile liability and multiple peril, as well as assumed reinsurance and healthcare related coverages. A brief summary of these lines of business and the associated reserve development is discussed below. Approximately $600.0 million of the adverse loss development was a result of several coverages provided to commercial entities. The gross and net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for Standard Lines at the beginning of 2001 was $12,070.0 and $9,129.0 million. Reserve analyses performed during 2001 showed unexpected increases in the size of claims for several lines, including commercial automobile liability, general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril coverages. In addition, the number of commercial automobile liability claims was higher than expected and several state specific factors resulted in higher than anticipated losses, including developments associated with commercial automobile liability coverage in Ohio and general liability coverage provided to contractors in New York. The unfavorable development was driven principally by accident years 1997 through 2000. 35 The remaining development affecting years prior to 1997 was driven principally by construction defect claims as described below. The commercial automobile liability analysis indicated increased ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense across several accident years due to higher paid and reported claim and claim adjustment expense resulting from several factors. These factors include uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage in Ohio, a change in the rate at which the average claim size was increasing and a lack of improvement in the ratio of the number of claims per exposure unit, the frequency. First, Ohio courts had significantly broadened the population covered through the uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage. The broadening of the population covered by this portion of the policy, and the retrospective nature of this broadening of coverage, resulted in additional claims for older years. Second, in recent years, the average claim size had been increasing at less than a 2.0% annual rate. The available data indicated that the rate of increase was closer to 8.0% with only a portion of this increase explainable by a change in mix of business. Finally, the review completed during the second quarter of 2001 indicated that the frequency for the 2000 accident year was 6.0% higher than 1999. Expectations were that the 2000 frequency would show an improvement from the 1999 level. The analyses of general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril coverages showed several factors affecting these lines. Construction defect claims in California and a limited number of other states have had a significant impact. It was expected that the number of claims being reported and the average size of those claims would fall quickly due to the decrease in business exposed to those losses. However, the number of claims reported during the first six months of 2001 increased from the number of claims reported during the last six months of 2000. In addition to the effects of construction defect claims, the average claim associated with New York labor law has risen to more than $125,000 from less than $100,000, which was significantly greater than previously expected. An analysis of assumed reinsurance business written by CNA Re showed that the paid and reported losses for recent accident years were higher than expectations, which resulted in management recording net unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves of approximately $560.0 million. The gross and net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves at the beginning of 2001 for CNA Re was $4,238.0 and $2,735.0 million. Because of the long and variable reporting pattern associated with assumed reinsurance as well as uncertainty regarding possible changes in the reporting methods of the ceding companies, the carried reserves for assumed reinsurance was based mainly on the pricing assumptions until experience emerges to show that the pricing assumptions are no longer valid. The reviews completed during the second quarter of 2001, including analysis at the individual treaty level, showed that the pricing assumptions were no longer appropriate. The classes of business with the most significant changes included excess of loss liability, professional liability and proportional and retrocessional property. The unfavorable reserve development was driven principally by accident years 1996 through 2000. Approximately $320.0 million of adverse loss development was due to adverse experience in all other lines, primarily in coverages provided to healthcare related entities written by CNA HealthPro. The gross and net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves at the beginning of 2001 for Specialty Lines was approximately $4,813.0 and $3,429.0 million. The level of paid and reported losses associated with coverages provided to national long term care facilities were higher than expected. The long term care facility business had traditionally been limited to local facilities. In recent years, CNA began to provide coverage to large chains of long term care facilities. Original assumptions were that these chains would exhibit loss ratios similar to the local facilities. The most recent review of these large chains indicated an overall loss ratio in excess of 500.0% versus approximately 100.0% for the remaining business. In addition, the average size of claims resulting from coverages provided to physicians and institutions providing healthcare related services increased more than expected. The review indicated that the average loss had increased to over $330,000. Prior to this review, the expectation for the average loss was approximately $250,000. Unfavorable reserve development of $240.0 million was recorded for accident years 1997 through 2000. The remaining unfavorable reserve development was attributable to accident years prior to 1997. Concurrent with CNAs review of loss reserves, CNA completed comprehensive studies of estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities. These studies included ground up reviews of retrospective premium accruals utilizing a more comprehensive database of retrospectively rated contracts. This review included application of the policy retrospective rating parameters to the revised estimate of ultimate loss ratio and consideration of actual interim cash settlement. This study resulted in a change in the estimated retrospective premiums receivable balances. 36 As a result of this review and changes in premiums associated with the change in estimates for loss reserves, CNA recorded a pretax reduction in premium accruals of $566.0 million. The effect on net earned premiums was $616.0 million offset by a reduction of accrued commissions of $50.0 million. The studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the estimate of ultimate losses. Approximately $188.0 million of this amount resulted from a change in estimate in premiums related to involuntary market facilities, which had an offsetting impact on net losses and therefore had no impact on the net operating results. More than one half of the change in estimate in premiums was attributable to accident years 1997 through 1999 with the remainder attributable to years prior to 1992. Accruals for ceded premiums related to other reinsurance treaties increased $83.0 million due to the reserve strengthening. This increase in accruals for ceded premiums were principally recorded in accident year 2000. The remainder of the decrease in premium accruals relates to the change in estimate of the amount of retrospective premium receivables as discussed above, which were principally recorded in accident years prior to 1999. Reinsurance CNA assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurers, reinsurers and members of various reinsurance pools and associations. CNA utilizes reinsurance arrangements to limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk, minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. Reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of each product line and CNAs retained amount varies by type of coverage. Generally, property risks are reinsured on an excess of loss, per risk basis. Liability coverages are generally reinsured on a quota share basis in excess of CNAs retained risk. CNAs ceded life reinsurance includes utilization of coinsurance, yearly renewable term and facultative programs. A majority of the reinsurance utilized by CNAs life insurance operations relates to term life insurance policies. Term life insurance policies issued from 1994 onward are generally ceded at 60% 90% of the face value. Universal Life policies issued from 1998 onward are generally ceded at 75% of the face value. CNAs overall reinsurance program includes certain property and casualty contracts, such as the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties discussed in more detail later in this section, that are entered into and accounted for on a "funds withheld" basis. Under the funds withheld basis, CNA records the cash remitted to the reinsurer for the reinsurers margin, or cost of the reinsurance contract, as ceded premiums. The remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance contract is recorded as funds withheld liabilities. CNA is required to increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting rates applied to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under the terms of the contract. The funds withheld liability is reduced by any cumulative claim payments made by CNA in excess of CNAs retention under the reinsurance contract. If the funds withheld liability is exhausted, interest crediting will cease and additional claim payments are recoverable from the reinsurer. The funds withheld liability is recorded in reinsurance balances payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest cost on these contracts is credited during all periods in which a funds withheld liability exists. Interest cost, which is included in investment income, net was $239.6, $241.4 and $86.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The amount subject to interest crediting rates on such contracts was $2,766.0 and $2,724.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The amount subject to interest crediting on these funds withheld contracts will vary over time based on a number of factors, including the timing of loss payments and ultimate gross losses incurred. CNA expects that it will continue to incur significant interest costs on these contracts for several years. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. Therefore, a credit exposure exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under reinsurance agreements. Amounts receivable from reinsurers were $12,695.3 and $13,823.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Of these amounts, $957.0 and $838.0 million were billed to reinsurers as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, as reinsurance contracts generally require payment of claims by the ceding company before the amount can be billed to the reinsurer. The remaining receivable relates to the estimated case and incurred but not reported losses ("IBNR") reserves and future policyholder benefits ceded under reinsurance contracts. CNA attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements only with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining substantial amounts of collateral. The primary 37 methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral was approximately $4,825.0 and $3,696.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. CNAs largest recoverables from a single reinsurer at December 31, 2002, including prepaid reinsurance premiums, were approximately $2,090.0, $1,456.0, $890.0, $616.0, $598.0, and $541.0 million from subsidiaries of Allstate, subsidiaries of Hannover Reinsurance (Ireland) Ltd., American Reinsurance Company, European Reinsurance Company of Zurich, subsidiaries of Gerling Global Reinsurance Corporation, and Lloyds Underwriters. CNA has reinsurance receivables from several reinsurers who have recently experienced multiple downgrades of their financial strength ratings, have announced that they will no longer accept new business and are placing their books of business into run off. CNAs principal credit exposures from these recent events arise from reinsurance receivables from Gerling Global ("Gerling"), Trenwick and Commercial Risk insurance groups. At December 31, 2002, CNA had approximately $926.0 million of reinsurance receivables from these reinsurers, of which $384.0 million was not supported by collateral. The majority of the uncollateralized receivables were due from U.S. domiciled insurers. Of the $384.0 million of reinsurance recoverables unsupported by collateral, $170.0 million relates to Gerling. Gerling has stated that CNA transfer approximately $204.0 million of funds withheld balances on three treaties relating to CNA HealthPro to a trust established by Gerling for the benefit of CNA, or in the absence of such transfer, that these treaties be commuted. CNA has taken Gerlings statement under advisement. In certain circumstances, including significant deterioration of a reinsurers financial strength ratings, CNA may engage in commutation discussions with an individual reinsurer. The outcome of such discussions may result in a lump sum settlement that is less than the recorded receivable, net of any applicable allowance for doubtful accounts. Losses arising from commutations, including any related to Gerling, could have an adverse material impact on the Companys results of operations or equity. CNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for estimated uncollectible reinsurance receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $195.7 and $170.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. While CNA believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on current collateral and information currently available, failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations or equity. For 2002, CNA entered into a corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty covering substantially all of CNAs property and casualty lines of business (the "2002 Cover"). Ceded premium related to the reinsurers margin of $10.0 million was recorded in 2002. No losses were ceded during 2002 under this contract, and the 2002 Cover was commuted as of December 31, 2002. In 1999, CNA entered into an aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 1999 through 2001 accident years covering substantially all of CNAs property and casualty lines of business (the "Aggregate Cover"). CNA has two sections of coverage under the terms of the Aggregate Cover. These coverages attach at defined loss ratios for each accident year. Coverage under the first section of the Aggregate Cover, which is available for all accident years covered by the contract, has annual limits of $500.0 million of ceded losses with an aggregate limit of $1.0 billion of ceded losses for the three year period. The ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses and for each $500.0 million of limit the ceded premium is $230.0 million. The second section of the Aggregate Cover, which was only utilized for accident year 2001, provides additional coverage of up to $510.0 million of ceded losses for a maximum ceded premium of $310.0 million. Under the Aggregate Cover, interest charges on the funds withheld liability accrue at 8.0% per annum. If the aggregate loss ratio for the three year period exceeds certain thresholds, additional premiums may be payable and the rate at which interest charges are accrued would increase to 8.25% per annum commencing in 2006. The coverage under the second section of the Aggregate Cover was triggered for the 2001 accident year. As a result of losses related to the WTC event, the limit under this section was exhausted. Additionally, as a result of the significant reserve additions recorded in the second quarter of 2001, the $500.0 million limit on the 1999 accident year under the first section was also fully utilized. No losses have been ceded to the remaining $500.0 million of aggregate limit on accident years 2000 and 2001 under the first section of the Aggregate Cover. 38 The impact of the Aggregate Cover on pretax operating results was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 (In millions) Ceded earned premium $ (543.0) Ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses 1,010.0 Interest charges $(51.0) (81.0) Pretax (expense) benefit on operating results $(51.0) $ 386.0 In 2001, CNA entered into a one year aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 2001 accident year covering substantially all property and casualty lines of business in the Continental Casualty Company pool (the "CCC Cover"). The loss protection provided by the CCC Cover has an aggregate limit of approximately $760.0 million of ceded losses. The ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses. The ceded premium related to full utilization of the $760.0 million of limit is $456.0 million. The CCC Cover provides continuous coverage in excess of the second section of the Aggregate Cover discussed above. Under the CCC Cover, interest charges on the funds withheld generally accrue at 8.0% per annum. The interest rate increases to 10.0% per annum if the aggregate loss ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Losses of $618.0 million have been ceded under the CCC Cover through December 31, 2002. The impact of the CCC Cover on pretax operating results was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 (In millions) Ceded earned premiums $(101.0) $ (260.0) Ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses 148.0 470.0 Interest charges (37.0) (20.0) Pretax benefit on operating results $ 10.0 $ 190.0 The impact by operating segment of the Aggregate Cover and the CCC Cover on pretax operating results was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 (In millions) Standard Lines $ (52.0) $ 381.0 Specialty Lines 2.0 33.0 CNA Re 12.0 162.0 Total Property and Casualty (38.0) 576.0 Other Insurance (3.0) Pretax impact on operating results $ (41.0) $ 576.0 2001 Restructuring In 2001, CNA finalized and approved two separate restructuring plans. The first plan related to CNAs Information Technology operations (the "IT Plan"). The second plan related to restructuring the property and casualty segments and Life Operations, discontinuation of the variable life and annuity business and consolidation of real estate locations (the "2001 Plan"). IT Plan The overall goal of the IT Plan was to improve technology for the underwriting function and throughout CNA and to eliminate inefficiencies in the deployment of IT resources. The changes facilitated a strong focus on enterprise wide system initiatives. The IT Plan had two main components, which included the reorganization of IT resources into the Technology and Operations Group with a structure based on centralized, functional roles and the implementation of an 39 integrated technology roadmap that included common architecture and platform standards that directly support CNAs strategies. As summarized in the following table, during 2001, CNA incurred $62.0 million pretax, or $35.0 million after tax and minority interest, of restructuring and other related charges for the IT Plan. During 2002, $4.0 million pretax, or $2.6 million after tax and minority interest, of this accrual was reduced. Employee Termination Impaired and Related Asset Other Year Ended December 31, 2001 Benefit Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) Standard Lines $ 5.0 $ 1.0 $ 6.0 Specialty Lines 2.0 2.0 Total Property and Casualty 7.0 1.0 8.0 Life Operations 17.0 17.0 Other Insurance 22.0 14.0 $ 1.0 37.0 Pretax impact on operating results $ 29.0 $ 32.0 $ 1.0 $ 62.0 In connection with the IT Plan after the write off of impaired assets, CNA accrued $30.0 million of restructuring and other related charges in 2001 (the "IT Plan Initial Accrual"). These charges primarily related to $29.0 million of workforce reductions of approximately 260 positions gross and net and $1.0 million of other costs. The following table summarizes the IT Plan Initial Accrual and the activity in that accrual during 2002 and 2001. Employee Termination Impaired and Related Asset Other Benefit Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) IT Plan Initial Accrual $ 29.0 $ 32.0 $ 1.0 $ 62.0 Cost that did not require cash in 2001 (32.0) (32.0) Payments charged against liability in 2001 (19.0) (19.0) Accrued costs at December 31, 2001 10.0 1.0 11.0 Payments charged against liability in 2002 (2.0) (2.0) Reduction of accrual (3.0) (1.0) (4.0) Accrued costs at December 31, 2002 $ 5.0 $ 5.0 Through December 31, 2002, 249 employees were released due to the IT Plan, nearly all of whom were technology support staff. In December of 2002, the accrual was reduced by $4.0 million in the Other Insurance segment primarily related to employee termination costs. The remaining $5.0 million of the accrual relating to employee termination and related benefit costs is expected to be paid through 2005. 2001 Plan The overall goal of the 2001 Plan was to create a simplified and leaner organization for customers and business partners. The major components of the plan included a reduction in the number of strategic business units ("SBUs") in the property and casualty operations, changes in the strategic focus of the Life Operations and Group Operations and consolidation of real estate locations. The reduction in the number of property and casualty SBUs resulted in consolidation of SBU functions, including underwriting, claims, marketing and finance. The strategic changes in Group Operations included a decision to discontinue the variable life and annuity business. 40 As summarized in the following table, during 2001, CNA incurred $189.0 million pretax, or $109.4 million after tax and minority interest, of restructuring and other related charges for the 2001 Plan. During 2002, $32.0 million pretax, or $18.4 million after tax and minority interest, of this accrual was reduced. Employee Termination Lease Impaired and Related Termination Asset Other Year Ended December 31, 2001 Benefit Costs Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) Standard Lines $ 40.0 $ 40.0 Specialty Lines 7.0 7.0 CNA Re 2.0 $ 4.0 6.0 Total Property and Casualty 49.0 4.0 53.0 Group Operations 7.0 $ 35.0 42.0 Life Operations 3.0 $ 9.0 12.0 Other Insurance 9.0 52.0 21.0 82.0 Pretax impact on operating results $ 68.0 $ 56.0 $ 30.0 $ 35.0 $189.0 All lease termination costs and impaired asset charges, except lease termination costs incurred by operations in the United Kingdom and software write offs incurred by Life Operations, were charged to the Other Insurance segment because office closure and consolidation decisions were not within the control of the other segments affected. Lease termination costs incurred in the United Kingdom relate solely to the operations of CNA Re. All other charges were recorded in the segment benefiting from the services or existence of an employee or an asset. In connection with the 2001 Plan, CNA accrued $189.0 million of these restructuring and other related charges (the "2001 Plan Initial Accrual"). These charges include employee termination and related benefit costs, lease termination costs, impaired asset charges and other costs. The following table summarizes the 2001 Plan Initial Accrual and the activity in that accrual during 2001 and 2002. Employee Termination Lease Impaired and Related Termination Asset Other Year Ended December 31, 2001 Benefit Costs Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) 2001 Plan Initial Accrual $ 68.0 $ 56.0 $ 30.0 $ 35.0 $189.0 Cost that did not require cash (35.0) (35.0) Payments charged against liability (2.0) (2.0) Accrued costs December 31, 2001 66.0 56.0 30.0 152.0 Costs that did not require cash (1.0) (3.0) (9.0) (13.0) Payments charged against liability (53.0) (12.0) (4.0) (69.0) Reduction of accrual (10.0) (7.0) (15.0) (32.0) Accrued costs December 31, 2002 $ 2.0 $ 34.0 $ 2.0 $ 38.0 41 The following table summarizes the reduction of the 2001 Plan Initial Accrual by segment in 2002.

Through December 31, 2002, approximately 882 employees net were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 39.0% of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; approximately 52.0% of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters and related insurance services staff; and approximately 9.0% of these employees were in various other positions. During December of 2002, $8.0 million of the accrual was reduced primarily due to successful redeployment of employees to other positions within the organization. An accrual of $1.0 million remained at December 31 2002 relating to employee termination costs which will be paid in 2003. The 2001 Plan charges incurred and accrued by Specialty Lines were $7.0 million in 2001, related entirely to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 177 positions gross and net, of which $5.0 million related to severance and outplacement costs and $2.0 million related to other salary costs. Through December 31, 2002, approximately 126 employees net were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 26.0% of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; approximately 63.0% of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters and related insurance services staff; and approximately 11.0% of these employees were in various other positions. During December of 2002, the accrual was reduced by $1.0 million. An accrual of $1.0 million remained at December 31, 2002 relating to employee termination costs which will be paid in 2003. The 2001 Plan charges incurred and accrued by CNA Re were $6.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 33 positions gross and net, amounted to $2.0 million, all of which related to severance and outplacement costs. Payments of $1.0 million were made in 2002 for approximately 15 employees net released through December 31, 2002 due to the 2001 Plan. The remaining $4.0 million of charges incurred by CNA Re related to lease termination costs. Approximately $1.0 million was paid in 2002 related to lease termination costs. As a result of the sale of CNA Re U.K., the remaining accrual related to CNA Re of $4.0 million was reduced. See "Investments Insurance" that follows for further information. The 2001 Plan charges incurred and accrued by Group Operations were $42.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 187 positions, gross and net, amounted to $7.0 million. Through December 31, 2002, 82 employees net in Group Operations were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 28.0% of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; and approximately 72.0% of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters and related insurance services staff. Other costs of $35.0 million in Group Operations relate to a write off of deferred acquisition costs on in force variable life and annuity contracts, as CNA believes that the decision to discontinue these products will negatively impact the persistency of the business. The 2001 Plan charges incurred and accrued by Life Operations were $12.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in workforce of 207 positions gross and net, amounted to $3.0 million, which related primarily to severance and outplacement costs. Through December 31, 2002, approximately 144 employees net were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 23.0% of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; approximately 65.0% of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters and 42 related insurance services staff; and approximately 12.0% of these employees were in various other positions. Life Operations incurred and accrued $9.0 million of impaired asset charges related to software in 2001. In December of 2002, the remaining $1.0 million of this accrual was reduced. The 2001 Plan charges incurred and accrued by the Other Insurance segment were $82.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 194 positions gross and net, amounted to $9.0 million, of which $6.0 million related to severance and outplacement costs and $3.0 million related to other salary costs. Through December 31, 2002, 157 employees net were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 63.0% of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; approximately 28.0% of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters and related insurance services staff; and approximately 9.0% of these employees were in various other positions. In December of 2002, $1.0 million of the accrual was reduced for employee termination and related benefit cost. The Other Insurance segment also incurred $73.0 million of lease termination and asset impairment charges related to office closure and consolidation decisions not within the control of the other segments affected. Additionally, $7.0 million was reversed and included in 2002 income relating to lease obligations and $14.0 million relating to impaired asset charges. CNAs original plan contained a timeline to consolidate and reduce the number of office locations. Due to unfavorable conditions in the commercial real estate market, certain office relocations and consolidations occurred later than planned. As a result of such delays, a portion of the planned leasehold write offs and vacant office space were expensed as period costs, resulting in an excess initial accrual. Of the remaining $36.0 million accrual relating to lease termination costs and impaired asset charges, approximately $18.0 million is expected to be paid in 2003. At December 31, 2001, an accrual of $1.0 million for lease termination costs remained related to the August 1998 restructuring ("1998 Plan"). In December of 2002, this accrual was reduced. Reserves Estimates and Uncertainties CNA maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses and future policy benefits, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported. Claim and claim adjustment expense and future policy benefit reserves are reflected as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading "Insurance Reserves." Changes in estimates of Insurance Reserves are reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations, in the period in which the change arises. The level of Insurance Reserves maintained by CNA represents managements best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on its assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Insurance Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are estimates that are derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. Some of the many uncertain future events about which CNA makes assumptions and estimates are claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, economic inflation, the impact of underwriting policy and claims handling practices and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is ultimately settled (referred to in the insurance industry as the "tail"). CNAs experience has been that the inherent uncertainties of estimating Insurance Reserves are generally greater for casualty coverages (particularly long tail casualty risks such as APMT losses) than for property coverages. Estimates of the cost of future APMT claims are highly complex and include an assessment of, among other things, whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether recovery limits apply, allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom are in bankruptcy proceedings, inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories and tactics of plaintiffs lawyers. Reserves for property related catastrophes, both natural disasters and man made catastrophes such as terrorist acts, are also difficult to estimate. See the discussion of the Second Quarter 2001 Prior Year Reserve Strengthening, the WTC Event, and Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort and Asbestos Reserves for further information. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating APMT and catastrophe losses, CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues, which arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions change. These issues can have a negative effect on CNAs business by either 43 extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. Either development could require material increases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include: (i) increases in the number and size of water damage claims related to expenses for testing and remediation of mold conditions; (ii) increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products, and exposure to lead and radiation related to cellular phone usage; (iii) expected increases in the number and size of claims relating to accounting and financial reporting, including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims, in an environment of major corporate bankruptcies; and (iv) a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting insurers in class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices. The future impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is extremely hard to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of CNAs claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions. CNAs current Insurance Reserve levels reflect managements best estimate of CNAs ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses and future policy benefits at December 31, 2002, based upon known facts and current law. However, in light of the many uncertainties associated with making the estimates and assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews its reserve estimates on a regular and ongoing basis and makes changes as experience develops. CNA may in the future determine that its recorded Insurance Reserves are not sufficient and may increase its reserves by amounts that may be material, which could materially adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition. Any such increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against the Companys earnings for the period in which the change in estimate arises. The following table presents estimated volatility in carried claim and claim adjustment loss reserves for the property and casualty segments. Gross Estimated Carried Loss Volatility in December 31, 2002 Reserves Reserves (In millions, except %) Standard Lines $11,576.0 +/ 5.0% Specialty Lines 5,874.0 +/ 7.0% CNA Re 2,264.0 +/ 15.0% Other Insurance 4,847.0 +/ 20.0% The estimated volatility noted above does not represent a range around the actuarial point estimate of CNAs gross loss reserves, and it does not represent the range of all possible outcomes. The volatility represents an estimate of the inherent volatility associated with estimating loss reserves for the specific type of business written by each segment. The primary characteristics influencing the estimated level of volatility are the length of the claim settlement period, changes in medical and other claim costs, changes in the level of litigation or other dispute resolution processes, changes in the legal environment and the potential for different types of injuries emerging. Ceded reinsurance arrangements may reduce the volatility. Since ceded reinsurance arrangements vary by year, volatility in gross reserves may not result in comparable impacts to underwriting income or equity. CNAs insurance loss reserves are recorded at managements best estimate which is based on the reviews and analyses performed by CNAs actuaries and managements judgment as to the responsiveness of these reviews and analyses to the factors affecting CNAs loss and loss adjustment expense loss reserves. Management considers factors such as changes in inflation, changes in claim handling and case reserving, changes in underwriting and pricing, and changes in the legal environment. Management considers different specific factors for each situation since the factors affect each type of business differently. Terrorism Exposure CNA and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the WTC event. For the most part, CNA believes the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses, but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished. 44 On November 26, 2002, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "Act"), which establishes a program within the Department of the Treasury under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from future terrorist attacks with the insurance industry. The Act terminates on December 31, 2005. Each participating insurance company must pay a deductible before federal government assistance becomes available. This deductible is based on a percentage of direct earned premiums for commercial insurance lines from the previous calendar year, and rises from 1.0% from date of enactment to December 31, 2002 (the "Transition Period") to 7.0% during the first subsequent calendar year, 10.0% in year two and 15.0% in year three. For losses in excess of a companys deductible, the federal government will cover 90.0% of the excess losses, while companies retain the remaining 10.0%. Losses covered by the program will be capped annually at $100.0 billion; above this amount, insurers are not liable for covered losses and Congress is to determine the procedures for and the source of any payments. Amounts paid by the federal government under the program over certain phased limits are to be recouped by the Department of the Treasury through policy surcharges, which cannot exceed 3.0% of annual premium. Insurance companies providing commercial property and casualty insurance are required to participate in the program, but it does not cover life or health insurance products. State law limitations applying to premiums and policies for terrorism coverage are not generally affected under the program, but they are pre empted in relation to prior approval requirements for rates and forms. The Act has policyholder notice requirements in order for insurers to be reimbursed for terrorism related losses and, from the date of enactment until December 31, 2004, a mandatory offer requirement for terrorism coverage, although it may be rejected by insureds. The Secretary of the Department of the Treasury has discretion to extend this offer requirement until December 31, 2005. While the Act provides the property and casualty industry with an increased ability to withstand the effect of a terrorist event during the next three years, given the unpredictability of the nature, targets, severity or frequency of potential terrorist events, CNAs results of operations or equity could nevertheless be materially adversely impacted by them. CNA is attempting to mitigate this exposure through its underwriting practices, policy terms and conditions (where applicable) and the use of reinsurance. In addition, under state laws, CNA is generally prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation, individual life and group life and health policies, and is also prohibited from excluding coverage for fire losses following a terrorist event in a number of states. Reinsurers obligations for terrorism related losses under reinsurance agreements are not covered by the Act. CNAs current reinsurance arrangements either exclude terrorism coverage or significantly limit the level of coverage. Property and Casualty CNA conducts its property and casualty operations through the following operating segments: Standard Lines, Specialty Lines, and CNA Re. The discussion of underwriting results and ratios reflect the underlying business results of CNAs property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. Underwriting ratios are industry measures of property and casualty underwriting results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of dividends incurred to net earned premiums. 45 The following table summarizes key components of the property and casualty segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In millions, except %) Net written premiums $ 7,008.0 $ 5,459.0 $ 6,773.0 Net earned premiums 6,838.0 5,010.0 6,927.0 Underwriting loss (439.0) (3,053.0) (644.0) Investment income, net 795.0 974.0 1,330.0 Net operating income (loss) 258.4 (1,224.8) 428.2 Ratios: Loss and loss adjustment expense 74.2% 113.3% 76.6% Expense 31.1 45.3 31.5 Dividend 1.1 2.3 1.2 Combined 106.4% 160.9% 109.3% 2001 adjusted underwriting loss* $ (805.0) 2001 adjusted ratios Loss and loss adjustment expense 74.3% Expense 37.2 Dividend 1.9 Combined 113.4% * The 2001 adjusted underwriting loss and adjusted ratios exclude the impact of the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening, the WTC event, both net of the related benefit of corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, and restructuring and other related charges. 2002 Compared with 2001 Net operating income for the property and casualty segment was $258.4 million in 2002 as compared with a net operating loss of $1,224.8 million in 2001. The 2001 operating results include prior year reserve strengthening of $1,086.8 million recorded in the second quarter of 2001 related to a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves and retrospective premium accruals, net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit, estimated losses related to the WTC event of $209.0 million, net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties benefit, and restructuring and other related charges of $36.8 million recorded in 2001. Excluding these 2001 significant items, 2002 net operating results increased $150.6 million. This increase was due primarily to improved underwriting results and a reduction in the accrual for restructuring and other related charges of $5.4 million after tax and minority interest. The 2001 operating results include a $141.8 million charge, after tax and minority interest, to strengthen prior underwriting year loss reserves for CNA Re U.K., unfavorable 2001 underwriting results for the London based primary commercial and marine operations, $46.1 million related to the bankruptcy filing by certain Enron entities and $52.5 million benefit related to core corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties. Partially offsetting these improvements was a decline in investment income, including a $48.3 million decrease in limited partnership income. The combined ratio decreased 7.0 points in 2002 as compared with 2001 and the underwriting results for the property and casualty segment improved $366.0 million. This change was due to decreases in the loss expense and dividend ratios. The loss ratio decreased 0.1 points as a result of improved current accident year results related to rate increases and new business across property and casualty operations and favorable prior year reserve development in Standard Lines in 2002. Partially offsetting these improvements was unfavorable prior year reserve development in Specialty Lines and CNA Re recorded in 2002. The property and casualty segment recorded $26.0 million of unfavorable reserve 46 development in 2002 as compared with $284.0 million of unfavorable reserve development in 2001. The gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was $19,714.0 and $23,166.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was $11,997.0 and $14,262.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Specialty Lines recorded unfavorable prior year reserve development of approximately $180.0 million for CNA HealthPro in 2002, which was driven principally by medical malpractice excess products provided to hospitals and physicians and coverages provided to long term care facilities, principally national for profit nursing homes. Approximately $100.0 million of the prior year unfavorable reserve development was related to assumed excess products and loss portfolio transfers, and was primarily driven by unexpected increases in the number of excess claims in accident years 1999 and 2000. The percentage of total claims greater than $1.0 million has increased by 33.0%, from less than 3.0% of all claims to more than 4.0% of all claims. CNA HealthPro no longer writes assumed excess products and loss portfolio transfers. Approximately $50.0 million of the prior year unfavorable reserve development was related to long term care facilities. The development was principally recorded for accident years 1997 through 2000. The average value of claims closed during the first several months of 2002 increased by more than 50.0% when compared to claims closed during 2001. In response to those trends, CNA HealthPro has reduced its writings of national for profit nursing home chains. Excess products provided to healthcare institutions and physician coverages in a limited number of states were responsible for the remaining development in CNA HealthPro. The unfavorable reserve development on excess products provided to institutions for accident years 1996 through 1999 resulted from increases in the size of claims experienced by these institutions. Due to the increase in the size of claims, more claims were exceeding the point at which these excess products apply. The unfavorable reserve development on physician coverages was recorded for accident years 1999 through 2001 in Oregon, California, Arizona and Nevada. The average claim size in these states has increased by 20.0%, driving the change in losses. The Marine business recorded unfavorable reserve development of approximately $65.0 million during 2002. Approximately $50.0 million of this unfavorable reserve development was due to participation in voluntary pools. About half of the reserve development was recorded in accident years 1999 and 2000 with the remainder attributable to accident years prior to 1999. The reserves were based on recommendations provided by the pools. Participation in many of these pools has been discontinued. The remaining reserve development for the Marine business was due principally to unfavorable reserve development on hull and liability coverages from accident years 1999 and 2000 offset by favorable reserve development on cargo coverages recorded for accident year 2001. Reviews completed during 2002 showed additional reported losses on individual large accounts and other bluewater business that drove the unfavorable hull and liability reserve development. These additional losses during 2002 for accident years 1999 and 2000 were almost 75.0% higher than the provision that had been established at the end of 2001. Offsetting the unfavorable reserve development was favorable development in CNA Pro and for Enron related exposures. Programs providing professional liability coverage to accountants, lawyers and realtors primarily drove favorable prior year reserve development of approximately $110.0 million in CNA Pro. Reviews of this business completed during 2002 have shown little activity for older accident years (principally prior to 1999), which reduced the need for reserves on these years. The reported losses on these programs for accident years prior to 1999 increased by approximately $5.0 million during 2002. This increase compared to the total reserve at the beginning of 2002 of approximately $180.0 million, net of reinsurance. Additionally, favorable reserve development of $20.0 million was associated with the Enron settlement. CNA had established a $20.0 million reserve for accident year 2001 for an excess layer associated with Enron related surety losses; however, the case has settled for less than the attachment point of this excess layer. Also recorded in 2001 was reserve strengthening for the London based commercial and marine operations and losses related to Enron entities as discussed above. CNA Re recorded prior year reserve strengthening as a result of an actuarial review completed during 2002 and was primarily recorded in the directors and officers, professional liability errors and omissions, and surety lines of business. Several large losses, as well as continued increases in the overall average size of claims for these lines, have resulted in higher than expected loss ratios. Standard Lines recorded approximately $140.0 million of favorable prior year reserve development attributable to participation in the Workers Compensation Reinsurance Bureau ("WCRB"), a reinsurance pool, and residual market. The favorable prior year reserve development for WCRB was the result of information received from the WCRB that 47 reported the results of a recent actuarial review. This information indicated that CNAs net required reserves for accident years 1970 through 1996 were $60.0 million less than the carried reserves. In addition, during 2002, CNA commuted accident years 1965 through 1969 for a payment of approximately $5.0 million to cover carried reserves of approximately $13.0 million, resulting in further favorable reserve development of $8.0 million. The favorable residual market prior year reserve development was the result of lower than expected paid loss activity during recent periods for accident years dating back to 1984. The paid losses during 2002 on prior accident years were approximately 60.0% of the previously expected amount. In addition, Standard Lines had favorable prior year reserve development, primarily in the package liability and auto liability lines of business due to new claims initiatives. These new claims initiatives, which included specialized training on specific areas of the claims adjudication process, enhanced claims litigation management, enhanced adjuster level metrics to monitor performance and more focused metric based claim file review and oversight, are expected to produce significant reductions in ultimate claim costs. Based on managements best estimate of the reduction in ultimate claim costs, approximately $100.0 million of favorable prior year reserve development was recorded in 2002. Approximately one half of this favorable reserve development was recorded in accident years prior to 1999, with the remainder of the favorable reserve development recorded in accident years 1999 to 2001. Additional favorable reserve development may be recorded in the future as management continues to monitor these estimates and as additional evidence becomes available to measure the effectiveness of the claim cost containment initiatives and managements corresponding estimate of such expected ultimate claim cost reductions. While management believes that the estimate of ultimate claim cost reductions as a result of the claim cost containment initiatives is reasonable, there can be no assurance that the ultimate expected claim cost reductions will be achieved, or that any additional favorable development will be recorded as a result of the claim cost containment initiatives described above. Approximately $50.0 million of favorable prior year reserve development during 2002 was recorded in commercial automobile liability. Most of the favorable development was from accident year 2000. The most recent actuarial review showed that underwriting actions have resulted in reducing the number of commercial automobile liability claims for recent accident years, especially the number of large losses. Approximately $45.0 million of favorable reserve development was recorded in property lines during 2002. The favorable reserve development was principally from accident years 1999 through 2001, and was the result of the low number of large losses in recent years. Although property claims are generally reported relatively quickly, determining the ultimate cost of the claim can involve a significant amount of time between the occurrence of the claim and settlement. Offsetting these favorable reserve developments were approximately $100.0 million of unfavorable reserve development in middle market workers compensation, approximately $70.0 million of unfavorable reserve development in programs written in CNA E&S, approximately $30.0 million of unfavorable reserve development on a contractors account package policy program, and approximately $20.0 million of unfavorable development on middle market general liability coverages. The unfavorable reserve development on workers compensation was principally due to additional reinsurance premiums for accident years 1999 through 2001. A CNA E&S program covering facilities that provide services to developmentally disabled individuals, accounts for approximately $50.0 million of the unfavorable reserve development. The development is due to an increase in the size of known claims and increases in policyholder defense costs. These increases became apparent as the result of a review completed during 2002, with most of the development from accident years 1999 and 2000. The other program, which contributed to the CNA E&S development, covers tow truck and ambulance operators in the 2000 and 2001 accident years. This program was started in 1999. CNA expected that loss ratios for this business would be similar to its middle market commercial automobile liability business. Reviews completed during the year resulted in estimated loss ratios on the tow truck and ambulance business that are 25 points higher than the middle market commercial automobile liability loss ratios. The unfavorable reserve development on contractors account package policies was the result of an actuarial review completed during 2002. Since this program is no longer being written, CNA expected that the change in reported losses 48 would decrease each quarterly period. However, in recent quarterly periods, the change in reported losses has been higher than prior quarters, resulting in the unfavorable reserve development. The expense ratio decreased 6.1 points primarily as a result of reduced underwriting expenses resulting from decreased head count as a result of the 2001 Plan and other expense reduction initiatives and an increase in the net earned premium base. The dividend ratio decreased 0.8 points due primarily to favorable current accident year dividends in Standard Lines. Net written premiums for the property and casualty segment increased $1,549.0 million for 2002 compared with 2001. Included in 2001 net written premium was $957.0 million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and WTC event, and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net written premium increased $592.0 million primarily as a result of strong rate increases, increased new business and lower ceded premiums across the property and casualty segment. Net earned premiums for the property and casualty segment increased $1,828.0 million for 2002 compared with 2001. Included in 2001 net earned premium was $1,336.0 million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and WTC event, and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net earned premium increased $492.0 million due primarily to the increases in net written premiums noted above. Specialty Lines achieved average rate increases of 26.0%, 13.0% and 5.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000 for the contracts that renewed during these years and had retention rates of 76.0%, 78.0% and 78.0% for those contracts that were up for renewal. The retention rates above apply to Specialty Lines excluding the CNA Guaranty and Credit, Surety and Warranty businesses. Standard Lines achieved average rate increases of 27.0%, 17.0% and 13.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000 for the contracts that renewed during these years and had retention rates of 68.0%, 76.0% and 68.0% for those contracts that were up for renewal. 2001 Compared with 2000 The net operating loss for the property and casualty segment was $1,224.8 million in 2001 as compared with net operating income of $428.2 million in 2000. The 2001 operating results include prior year reserve strengthening of $1,086.8 million recorded in the second quarter of 2001 related to a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves and retrospective premium accruals, net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit, estimated losses related to the WTC event of $209.0 million, net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties benefit, and restructuring and other related charges of $36.8 million recorded in 2001. Excluding these 2001 significant items, 2001 net operating results declined $320.4 million. Net operating results for 2001 declined due to a $97.1 million decline in limited partnership income, unfavorable 2001 underwriting results for the London based primary commercial and marine operations and $46.1 million related to the bankruptcy filing by certain Enron entities. These declines were partially offset by lower prior year adverse loss reserve development (excluding the second quarter 2001 reserve development) and a $52.5 million benefit related to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties for core operations. Net operating results in 2000 benefited from a change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments of $52.0 million in 2000. The combined ratio increased 4.1 points in 2001 as compared with 2000 and the underwriting results for the property and casualty segment declined $161.0 million. This change was due to a decrease in the loss ratio, more than offset by increases in the expense and dividend ratios. The loss ratio decreased 2.3 points as a result of the improved underwriting results across most standard lines, particularly the automobile and package lines, due to earned rate achievement and re underwriting efforts undertaken last year, and lower prior year adverse loss development (excluding the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening). These improvements were partially offset by reduced net earned premium base, losses related to Enron, favorable loss development recorded in 2000 for the architects and engineers business not present in 2001, declined underwriting results in global and marine lines related to current accident year reserve strengthening as discussed above, and the prior underwriting year reserve strengthening of CNA Re U.K. The expense ratio increased 5.7 49 points primarily due to the decrease in the net earned premium base, the write off of unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs in the vehicle warranty line of business, an increase in the accrual for guaranty fund assessments related to the Reliance insolvency, and the decreased impact of the change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments. The dividend ratio increased 0.7 points primarily due to adverse development in dividend reserves in Standard Lines in 2001 compared with favorable development taken in 2000. Net written premiums for the property and casualty segment decreased $1,314.0 million for 2001 compared with 2000. Included in 2001 net written premium was $957.0 million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and WTC event, and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net written premium decreased $357.0 million primarily as a result of a change in the timing of recording written premiums for policies with future effective dates in Standard Lines of $119.0 million and in Specialty Lines of $23.0 million and additional ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties of $77.0 million in Specialty Lines and $161.0 million in CNA Re. Partially offsetting these decreases was $89.0 million of reinstatement and additional premiums related to the WTC event recorded in CNA Re. Net earned premiums for the property and casualty segment decreased $1,917.0 million for 2001 compared with 2000. Included in 2001 net earned premium was $1,336.0 million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and WTC event, and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net earned premium decreased $581.0 million due primarily to the decreases in net written premium noted above. Group Group Operations provides group life and group health insurance and investment products and services to employers, affinity groups and other entities that purchase insurance as a group. Group Operations includes three principal business units: Group Benefits, Federal Markets and Institutional Markets and Other, which also includes results from businesses that CNA has exited; retail variable life and annuities, and life reinsurance. 2002 Compared with 2001 Net operating income increased by $74.2 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. Included in the 2001 results were $30.6 million related to the WTC event and $23.6 million related to restructuring and other related charges. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net operating results improved $20.0 million due primarily to growth in the disability and long term care products, increased investment income and diminished losses due to the exit of unprofitable variable life and annuity lines of business. Net operating results also improved due to favorable reserve development relating to the WTC event of $3.6 million after tax and minority interest recorded in 2002. Partially offsetting these improvements was net unfavorable reserve strengthening in Group Benefits due to unfavorable mortality trends. Net earned premiums for Group Operations decreased $1,051.0 million for 2002 as compared with 2001. This decline was due primarily to the transfer of the Mail Handlers Plan partially offset by an increase in premiums in the disability and long term care products within Group Benefits. Net earned premiums for the Mail Handlers Plan was $1,151.0 million as compared with $2,218.0 million in 2001. Deposits for Group Operations decreased $41.0 million for 2002 as compared with 2001 primarily due to reduced sales of S&P 500 contracts in Institutional Markets. Group Operations achieved rate increases that averaged approximately 5.0%, 6.0% and 3.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000 for the disability, accident and life lines of business within Group Benefits. Premium persistency rates were approximately 81.0%, 81.0% and 84.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000. 50 2001 Compared with 2000 Net operating income decreased by $55.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. Included in the 2001 results were $30.6 million related to the WTC event and $23.6 million related to restructuring and other related charges. Included in the restructuring and other related charges was a $20.1 million write off of deferred acquisition costs on in force variable life and annuity contracts as CNA believes that its decision to discontinue these products would negatively impact the persistency of the business. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net operating results decreased $0.8 million primarily as a result of the sale of life reinsurance and a decrease in limited partnership income of $13.1 million. Life reinsurance contributed net operating income of $19.1 million in 2000. Partially offsetting these declines were improvements realized by exiting unprofitable lines of approximately $15.8 million and increased income in other product lines, primarily the single premium guaranteed annuity, GIC and disability and group long term care lines, of $15.8 million. Net earned premiums for Group Operations decreased $66.0 million for 2001 as compared with 2000. Net earned premiums declined $228.0 million as a result of the sale of life reinsurance. This decline was partially offset by increases in Federal Markets of $138.0 million due to increased medical cost trends and growth in Group Benefits of $36.0 million, particularly in the disability and group long term care lines of business. Deposits for Group Operations decreased $296.0 million in 2001 as compared to 2000 due to reduced sales of GIC and S&P 500 contracts in Institutional Markets. Life Life Operations provides financial protection to individuals through term life insurance, universal life insurance, individual long term care insurance, annuities and other products. Life Operations has several distribution relationships and partnerships including managing general agencies, other independent agencies working with CNA life sales offices, a network of brokers and dealers, and other independent insurance consultants. 2002 Compared with 2001 Net operating income increased by $29.0 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. Included in the 2001 results were $16.6 million related to restructuring and other related charges and $12.3 million related to the WTC event. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net operating results decreased $1.8 million due primarily to net reserve strengthening for individual long term care, unfavorable individual long term care morbidity and increased costs related to the life settlement business in 2002. These decreases were partially offset by higher investment income, a decrease in reinsurance charges, favorable reserve development relating to the WTC event of $8.9 million after tax and minority interest recorded in 2002 as compared with 2001, and a $0.9 million after tax and minority interest reduction of the accrual for restructuring and other related charges recorded in 2002. Sales volume for Life Operations decreased by $13.0 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was attributable primarily to lower sales of structured settlement annuities, partially offset by increased sales in the individual long term care product. Net earned premiums increased $57.0 million in 2002 as compared with 2001 attributable primarily to growth in the individual long term care product partially offset by sales declines in structured settlement annuities. As a result of recent experience and the fourth quarter reserve strengthening of $35.0 million pretax for individual long term care, CNA is undertaking a full review of its product offerings in this line. The focus is to determine whether the current products provide adequate pricing flexibility under the range of reasonably possible claims experience levels. Until this review is completed, CNA intends to significantly reduce new sales of this product. Premium will continue to be received on in force business, but the actions to reduce new business will lower the rate of overall premium growth for this line. The outcome of CNAs review and potential actions could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. 2001 Compared with 2000 Net operating income decreased by $48.2 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. Included in the 2001 results were $16.6 million related to restructuring and other related charges and $12.3 million related to the WTC event. Excluding 51 these 2001 significant items, net operating results decreased $19.3 million due primarily to decreased investment income from limited partnerships of $18.4 million. Sales volume for Life Operations increased by $133.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This increase was driven primarily by improved sales in structured settlements and increased renewals and new sales in individual long term care products. Net earned premiums increased $100.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This improvement is attributable primarily to improved sales of structured settlement annuities due to favorable pricing conditions and individual long term care products, partially offset by a decrease in new individual life business. Other Insurance The Other Insurance segment contains CNAs corporate interest expense, certain run off insurance operations, including personal insurance, losses and expenses related to the centralized adjusting and settlement of APMT claims, direct financial guarantee business underwritten by CNAs insurance affiliates, certain non insurance operations, including eBusiness initiatives and CNA UniSource, and inter company eliminations. 2002 Compared with 2001 Net operating results increased by $865.7 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. The impact of the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening on the Other Insurance segment was $732.4 million after tax and minority interest, including $680.8 million for APMT. See the Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort and Asbestos Reserves section following for a discussion of this charge. Net operating income in 2001 also decreased by $67.4 million of restructuring and other related charges and $14.9 million related to the WTC event for group reinsurance. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net operating results improved $51.0 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. Reduced expenses for e Business initiatives and improved results for group reinsurance were offset by lower investment income, principally resulting from a $5.4 million decline in limited partnership income, higher losses related to the run off of CNA UniSource and severance and other costs related to changes in senior management in 2002. Also contributing to the improvement was a $15.2 million reduction, after tax and minority interest, in the accrual for restructuring and other related charges recorded in 2002. During 2002, favorable net reserve development, including premium development, of $23.0 million was recorded in the Other Insurance segment as compared with unfavorable net reserve development of $63.0 million recorded in 2001, excluding the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening. The gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was $4,847.0 and $5,043.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was $2,002.0 and $2,110.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Personal insurance recorded unfavorable reserve development of $35.0 million on accident years 1997 through 1999. These losses were subject to retroactive reinsurance agreements with Allstate that cover losses occurring prior to October 1, 1999. These reinsurance agreements were entered into as part of the sale of CNAs personal insurance business to Allstate. CNA shares in indemnity and claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses if payments related to losses incurred prior to October 1, 1999 on the CNA policies transferred to Allstate exceed the claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves of approximately $1.0 billion at the date of sale. CNA must begin to reimburse Allstate for claim and allocated claim adjustment expense payments when cumulative claim payments after October 1, 1999 on losses occurring prior to that date exceed the $1.0 billion. CNAs remaining obligation valued under this loss sharing provision as of October 1, 2003, will be settled by agreement of the parties or by an independent actuarial review of the unpaid claim liabilities as of that date. Cumulative payments of indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expenses on such policies are expected to exceed $1.0 billion during 2003. CNA has established reserves for its estimated liability under this loss sharing arrangement. The unfavorable reserve development was principally due to continuing policyholder defense costs associated with remaining open claims. At the end of 2002, approximately 4,800 claims remain open. It was anticipated these claims would be closed more quickly, eliminating further defense coverage costs. The unfavorable reserve development on personal insurance was offset by favorable reserve development on other run off business, driven principally by financial and mortgage guarantee coverages from accident years 1997 and prior. The favorable reserve development on financial and mortgage guarantee coverages resulted from a review of the 52 underlying exposures and the outstanding losses. This review showed that salvage and subrogation continues to be collected on these types of claims, thereby reducing estimated future losses net of anticipated reinsurance recoveries. Total operating revenues decreased $31.0 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was due primarily to reduced revenues for CNA UniSource, due to the exit of this business, and reduced investment income partially offset by increased net earned premiums in group reinsurance. 2001 Compared with 2000 Net operating results declined $786.3 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. The impact of the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening on the Other Insurance segment was $732.4 million after tax and minority interest, including $680.8 million for APMT. See the Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort and Asbestos Reserves section following for a discussion of this charge. Net operating income for 2001 also decreased by $67.4 million for restructuring and other related charges and $14.9 million related to the WTC event for group reinsurance. Excluding these 2001 significant items, net operating results increased $28.4 million primarily as a result of lower interest expense on corporate borrowings in 2001 as compared with 2000 and a non recurring favorable adjustment of expense recoveries under a service contract related to personal insurance. These increases were partially offset by $39.1 million for non recurring ceding commissions included in 2000 results related to the transfer of the personal insurance line of business to Allstate in 1999, $30.6 million related to increased eBusiness initiatives in 2001 and $10.5 million due to decreased limited partnership income. Total operating revenues decreased $254.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This decline was due to a decrease in investment income and net earned premiums from run off insurance operations, particularly the entertainment and agriculture insurance lines. Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort and Asbestos ("APMT") Reserves CNAs property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures related to environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos claims. The following table provides data related to CNAs environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Environmental Environmental Pollution and Pollution and Mass Tort Asbestos Mass Tort Asbestos (In millions) Gross reserves $ 830.0 $ 1,758.0 $ 837.0 $1,644.0 Ceded reserves (313.0) (527.0) (204.0) (392.0) Net reserves $ 517.0 $ 1,231.0 $ 633.0 $1,252.0 There was no asbestos or environmental pollution and mass tort related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2002. As a result of a change in estimate resulting from CNAs semi annual ground up review of APMT accounts gross and ceded APMT reserves were increased. The settlement scenarios that supported higher estimated gross and higher estimated ceded reserves were judged to be the most appropriate. However, net reserves remained unchanged. The estimation of reinsurance recoverables on accounts is highly dependent on the allocation of each accounts estimated ultimate losses to their available historical insurance coverage. This allocation becomes more refined as accounts and their insurers enter more serious settlement negotiations. During 2002, net reserves were identified relating to APMT related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for assumed reinsurance pools, which reflects improvements in the identification of APMT activity from assumed reinsurance and pools. The inclusion of these additional APMT reserves increased the APMT reserves and decreased other reserves, resulting in no net change in CNAs overall carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. 53 Environmental Pollution and Mass Tort Environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues. Judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini Superfunds") govern the cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept of legal liability for cleanup and restoration by Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini Superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for cleanup of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so, and to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent upon a variety of factors. Further, the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown. To date, approximately 1,200 cleanup sites have been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and included on its National Priorities List ("NPL"). State authorities have designated many cleanup sites as well. Many policyholders have made claims against various CNA insurance subsidiaries for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters. The vast majority of these claims relate to accident years 1989 and prior, which coincides with CNAs adoption of the Simplified Commercial General Liability coverage form, which includes what is referred to in the industry as an "absolute pollution exclusion." CNA and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies, trigger of coverage, allocation of liability among triggered policies, applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions, the potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. A number of proposals to reform Superfund have been made by various parties. In 2002, no reforms were enacted by Congress. If there is legislation, and in some circumstances even if there is no legislation, the federal role in environmental cleanup may be significantly reduced in favor of state action. Substantial changes in the federal statute or the activity of the EPA may cause states to reconsider their environmental cleanup statutes and regulations. There can be no meaningful prediction of the pattern of regulation that would result or the possible impact upon the Companys results of operations or equity. CNAs ultimate liability for its environmental pollution and mass tort claims is impacted by several factors including ongoing disputes with policyholders over scope and meaning of coverage terms and in the area of environmental, court decisions that continue to restrict the scope and applicability of the absolute pollution exclusion contained in policies issued by CNA post 1989. Due to the inherent uncertainties described above, including the inconsistency of court decisions, the number of waste sites subject to cleanup, and in the area of environmental, the standards for cleanup and liability, the ultimate liability of CNA for environmental pollution and mass tort claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, CNA carried approximately $517.0 and $633.0 million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, for reported and unreported environmental pollution and mass tort claims. There was no environmental and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2002. Unfavorable environmental pollution and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 amounted to $468.0 and $15.0 million, respectively. CNA paid environmental pollution related claims and mass tort related claims, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $116.0, $203.0 and $135.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Asbestos CNAs property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have exposure to asbestos related claims. Estimation of asbestos related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves involves many of the same limitations discussed above for environmental pollution claims, such as inconsistency of court decisions, specific policy provisions, allocation of liability among insurers and insureds, and additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage. Furthermore, estimation of asbestos related claims is difficult due to, among other reasons, the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties, the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as 54 defendants, the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims. In the past several years, CNA has experienced significant increases in claim counts for asbestos related claims. The factors that led to these increases included, among other things, intensive advertising campaigns by lawyers for asbestos claimants, mass medical screening programs sponsored by plaintiff lawyers, and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors and installers of products containing asbestos. Currently, the majority of asbestos bodily injury claims are filed by persons exhibiting few, if any, disease symptoms. It is estimated that approximately 90.0% of the current non malignant asbestos claimants do not meet the American Medical Associations definition of impairment. Some courts, including the federal district court responsible for pre trial proceedings in all federal asbestos bodily injury actions, have ordered that so called "unimpaired" claimants may not recover unless at some point the claimants condition worsens to the point of impairment. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, CNA carried approximately $1,231.0 and $1,252.0 million of net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, for reported and unreported asbestos related claims. There was no asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2002. Unfavorable asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 amounted to $773.0 and $65.0 million. CNA paid asbestos related claims, net of reinsurance, of $20.0, $171.0 and $126.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, excluding payments made in connection with the 1993 settlement of litigation related to Fibreboard Corporation. CNA has structured settlement agreements with four of its policyholders for which it has future payment obligations. Structured settlement agreements provide for payments of sums certain over multiple years as set forth in each individual agreement. As to the four structured settlement agreements existing at December 31, 2002, payment obligations under those settlement agreements are projected to terminate in 2016. For these four structured settlement agreements, CNA has reserved $118.0 million, net of reinsurance. CNA, through its acquisition of CIC in 1995, acquired obligations under the Wellington Agreement. In 1985, 47 asbestos producers and their insurers, including CIC, executed the Wellington Agreement. The agreement intended to resolve all issues and litigation related to coverage for asbestos exposures. Under this agreement, signatory insurers committed scheduled policy limits and made the limits available to pay asbestos claims based upon coverage blocks designated by the policyholders in 1985, subject to extension by policyholders. CIC was a signatory insurer to the Wellington Agreement. At December 31, 2002, CNA had fulfilled its Wellington Agreement obligations as to all but five accounts. With respect to the five remaining unpaid Wellington obligations, CNA has evaluated its exposure under these agreements and has established a $28.0 million reserve, net of reinsurance, for Wellington obligations. CNA has also used coverage in place agreements to resolve large asbestos exposures. Coverage in place agreements are typically agreements between CNA and its policyholders identifying the policies and the terms for payment of asbestos related liabilities. Claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate documentation showing exposure during the policy periods and other documentation supporting the demand for claims payment. Coverage in place agreements may have annual payment caps. At December 31, 2002, CNA had negotiated 23 such agreements in which CNA committed coverage for payment of claims and claim related adjustment expenses subject to documentation requirements as set forth in the terms of each specific agreement. CNA has evaluated these commitments and has established a $66.0 million reserve, net of reinsurance, to fund coverage in place agreements based on current projections of claims volumes and severities. At December 31, 2002, CNAs total IBNR reserve for asbestos was $729.0 million, net of reinsurance. For asbestos exposures, CNA classifies its IBNR reserve as assigned or unassigned. In circumstances where CNA has executed a settlement agreement with its policyholder, CNA assigns IBNR reserve to that account to cover the projected value of the settlement. At December 31, 2002, the assigned IBNR reserve was $166.0 million, net of reinsurance. The unassigned IBNR reserve relates to potential development on accounts that have not settled and potential future claims for unidentified policyholders. At December 31, 2002, CNAs unassigned IBNR reserve was $563.0 million, net of reinsurance. 55 At December 31, 2002, CNA categorized active accounts as large or small accounts. CNA defined a large account as an active account with more than $100,000 cumulative paid losses through December 31, 2002. CNA had 150 large accounts with a collective reserve of $220.0 million, net of reinsurance. CNA made closing large accounts a significant management priority. Small accounts were defined as active accounts with $100,000 or less cumulative paid losses through December 31, 2002. CNA had 939 small accounts with a collective reserve of $90.0 million, net of reinsurance. The chart below depicts CNAs overall pending asbestos accounts and associated reserves: Asbestos Reserves (net) Percent Net Paid Net of Number of Losses Asbestos Asbestos December 31, 2002 Policyholders (Recoveries) Reserves Reserves (In millions of dollars) Policyholders with settlement agreements Structured settlements 4 $ 12.0 $ 118.0 9.6% Wellington 5 28.0 2.3 Coverage in place 23 (15.0) 66.0 5.3 Fibreboard 1 1.0 55.0 4.5 Total with settlement agreements 33 (2.0) 267.0 21.7 Other policyholders with active accounts Large asbestos accounts 150 (8.0) 220.0 17.9 Small asbestos accounts 939 16.0 90.0 7.3 Total other policyholders 1,089 8.0 310.0 25.2 Assumed reinsurance and pools 15.0 91.0 7.4 Unassigned IBNR 563.0 45.7 Total 1,122 $ 21.0 $1,231.0 100.0% In 2002, at least fifteen companies filed for bankruptcy protection citing costs associated with asbestos claims litigation as a basis for filing. Since 1982, at least sixty seven companies, including the fifteen companies that filed in 2002, that mined asbestos, or manufactured or used asbestos containing products, have filed for bankruptcy. This phenomenon has prompted plaintiff attorneys to file claims against companies that had only peripheral involvement with asbestos. Many of these defendants were users or distributors of asbestos containing products, or manufacturers of products in which asbestos was encapsulated. These defendants include equipment manufacturers, brake, gasket, and sealant manufacturers, and general construction contractors. According to a comprehensive report on asbestos litigation recently released by the Rand Corporation, over 6,000 companies have been named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits, with 75 out of 83 different types of industries in the United States impacted by asbestos litigation. The study found that a typical claimant names 70 to 80 defendants, up from an average of 20 in the early years of asbestos litigation. Some asbestos related defendants have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. CNA has such claims from a number of insureds. Some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products liability aggregate limits in their policies, who have asserted that their asbestos related claims fall within so called "non products" liability coverage contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage, and that the claimed "non products" coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage purportedly not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent, if any, the attempts to assert "non products" claims outside the products liability aggregate will succeed. CNA has attempted to manage such exposures by aggressive settlement strategies. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance any of these settlement efforts will be successful, or that any such claims can be settled on terms acceptable to CNA. Adverse developments with respect to such matters discussed in this paragraph could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations or equity. On February 13, 2003, CNA announced it had resolved asbestos related coverage litigation and claims involving A.P. Green Industries, A.P. Green Services and Bigelow Liptak Corporation. Under the agreement, CNA will be required to pay $74.0 million, net of reinsurance recoveries, over a ten year period. The settlement resolves CNAs liabilities for all pending and future asbestos claims involving A.P. Green Industries, Bigelow Liptak Corporation and related 56 subsidiaries, including alleged "non products" exposure. The settlement is subject to bankruptcy court approval and confirmation of a bankruptcy plan containing a channeling injunction to protect CNA from any future claims. CNAs recorded reserves as of December 31, 2002, included reserves for this exposure. CNA is engaged in insurance coverage litigation with Robert A. Keasbey Company ("Keasbey") and associated claimants in New York state court. (Continental Casualty Company v. Robert A. Keasbey Company et al., Supreme Court State of New York County of New York, No. 401621/02). Keasbey was a seller and installer of asbestos products in the New York and New Jersey area. CNA paid its full product liability limits to Keasbey in prior years. Claimants against Keasbey now claim CNA owes additional coverage under the operations section of policies issued to it by CNA. CNA is also a party to insurance coverage litigation between Burns & Roe Enterprises, Inc. ("Burns & Roe") and its insurance carriers related to asbestos bodily injury and wrongful death claims. (In re: Burns & Roe Enterprises, Inc., pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, No. 00 41610). Burns & Roe provided various engineering and related services in connection with construction projects. Burns & Roe is currently in bankruptcy. There are numerous factual and legal issues to be resolved in connection with these cases and it is difficult to predict the outcome or financial exposure represented by these matters in light of the novel theories asserted by policyholders and their counsel. Policyholders have also initiated litigation directly against CNA and other insurers. CNA has been named in Adams v. Aetna, Inc., et al. (Circuit Court of Kanhwha County, West Virginia), a purported class action against CNA and other insurers, alleging that the defendants violated West Virginias Unfair Trade Practices Act in handling and resolving asbestos claims against their policyholders. In addition, lawsuits have been filed in Texas against CNA, and other insurers and non insurer corporate defendants asserting liability for failing to warn of the dangers of asbestos. (Boson v. Union Carbide Corp., et al. (District Court of Nueces County, Texas)). It is difficult to predict the outcome or financial exposure represented by this type of litigation in light of the broad nature of the relief requested and the novel theories asserted. CNA reviews each active asbestos account every six months to determine whether changes in reserve estimates may be necessary. CNA considers input from its analyst professionals with direct responsibility for the claims, inside and outside counsel with responsibility for representation of CNA, and its actuarial staff. These professionals review, among many factors, the policyholders present and future exposures (including such factors as claims volume, disease mix, trial conditions, settlement demands and defense costs); the policies issued by CNA (including such factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits, whether the policy is primary, umbrella or excess, and the existence of policyholder retentions and or deductibles); the existence of other insurance; and reinsurance arrangements. Due to the uncertainties created by volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands, the effect of bankruptcies, the extent to which non impaired claimants can be precluded from making claims and the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits, the ultimate liability of CNA for asbestos related claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded. Other variables that will influence CNAs ultimate exposure to asbestos related claims will be medical inflation trends, jury attitudes, the strategies of plaintiff attorneys to broaden the scope of defendants, the mix of asbestos related diseases presented, CNAs abilities to recover reinsurance, future court decisions and the possibility of legislative reform. Adverse developments with respect to such matters discussed in this paragraph could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations or equity. With respect to environmental and mass tort reserves, commencing in 2000 and continuing into the first and second quarters of 2001, CNA received a number of new reported claims, some of which involved declaratory judgment actions premised on court decisions purporting to expand insurance coverage for pollution claims. In these decisions, several courts adopted rules of insurance policy interpretation which established joint and several liability for insurers consecutively on a risk during a period of alleged property damage; and in other instances adopted interpretations of the "absolute pollution exclusion," which weakened its effectiveness in most circumstances. In addition to receiving new claims and declaratory judgment actions premised upon these unfavorable legal precedents, these court decisions also impacted CNAs pending pollution and mass tort claims and coverage litigation. During the spring of 2001, CNA reviewed specific claims and litigation, as well as general trends, and concluded reserve strengthening in this area was necessary. 57 In the area of mass torts, several well publicized verdicts arising out of bodily injury cases related to allegedly toxic mold led to a significant increase in mold related claims in 2000 and the first half of 2001. CNAs reserve increase in the second quarter of 2001 was caused in part by this increased area of exposure. With respect to other court cases and how they might affect CNAs reserves and reasonable possible losses, the following should be noted. State and federal courts issue numerous decisions each year, which potentially impact losses and reserves in both a favorable and unfavorable manner. Examples of favorable developments include decisions to allocate defense and indemnity payments in a manner so as to limit carriers obligations to damages taking place during the effective dates of their policies; decisions holding that injuries occurring after asbestos operations are completed are subject to the completed operations aggregate limits of the policies; and decisions ruling that carriers loss control inspections of their insureds premises do not give rise to a duty to warn third parties to the dangers of asbestos. Examples of unfavorable developments include decisions limiting the application of the "absolute pollution" exclusion; and decisions holding carriers liable for defense and indemnity of asbestos and pollution claims on a joint and several basis. Throughout 2000, and into 2001, CNA experienced significant increases in new asbestos bodily injury claims. In light of this development, CNA formed the view that payments for asbestos claims could be higher in future years than previously estimated. Moreover, in late 2000 through mid 2001, industry sources such as rating agencies and actuarial firms released analyses and studies commenting on the increase in claim volumes and other asbestos liability developments. For example, A.M. Best released a study in May of 2001 increasing its ultimate asbestos reserve estimate 63.0% from $40.0 to $65.0 billion, citing an unfunded insurance industry reserve shortfall of $33.0 billion. In June of 2001, Tillinghast raised its asbestos ultimate exposure from $55.0 to $65.0 billion for the insurance industry and its estimate of the ultimate remaining asbestos liability for all industries was raised to $200.0 billion. Also in the 2000 to 2001 time period, a number of significant asbestos defendants filed for bankruptcy, increasing the likelihood that excess layers of insurance coverage could be called upon to indemnify policyholders and creating the potential that novel legal doctrines could be employed which could accelerate the time when such indemnification payments could be due. These developments led CNA to the conclusion that its asbestos reserves required strengthening. The results of operations or equity of the Company in future years may be adversely impacted by environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos claim and claim adjustment expenses. Management will continue to review and monitor these liabilities and make further adjustments, including the potential for further reserve strengthening, as necessary. Lorillard Lorillard, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Lorillard"). Lorillard, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The tobacco industry in the United States, including Lorillard, continues to be faced with a number of issues that have or may adversely impact the business, results of operations and financial condition of Lorillard and the Company, including the following: .. A substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars, as well as equitable and injunctive relief, arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes, addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, including claims for reimbursement of health care costs allegedly incurred as a result of smoking, as well as other alleged damages. .. A $16.3 billion punitive damage judgment against Lorillard in Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et al., a class action case in state court in Florida in which the jury awarded a total of $145.0 billion in punitive damages against all the defendants and which is currently on appeal. 58 .. Substantial annual payments by Lorillard, continuing in perpetuity, and restrictions on marketing and advertising agreed to under the terms of the settlement agreements entered into between the major cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, and each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories (together, the "State Settlement Agreements"). .. A continuing decline in the volume of wholesale cigarette sales in the United States, including 2002 volume declines of 3.7% for the domestic U.S. cigarette industry and 6.3% for Lorillard, according to information provided by Management Science Associates. .. Increases in industry wide promotional expenses and sales incentives implemented in reaction to the volume declines and impact of the price increases, and continuing intense competition among the four largest cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, and many smaller participants who have gained market share in recent years, principally in the discount and deep discount cigarette segment. Market share for the deep discount brands increased by an estimated 1.19 share points from 5.98% to 7.17% in 2002. .. Continuing and substantial increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales in 2002 ranging from $0.18 per pack to $0.69 per pack in 21 states, as well as excise tax increases by several municipalities such as New York City where the local tax increased from $0.08 to $1.50 in 2002, and proposals for additional increases in federal, state and local excise taxes. Lorillard believes that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that any future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including Lorillard, and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. .. Increasing sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the United States which adversely impact sales by the manufacturer of the counterfeited brands and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands. .. Increases in actual and proposed federal, state and local regulation of the tobacco industry and governmental restrictions on smoking. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for information with respect to the Engle action and other litigation against cigarette manufacturers and the State Settlement Agreements. 2002 Compared with 2001 Revenues decreased by $111.5 million, or 2.8%, and net income increased by $93.6 million, or 13.9%, in 2002 as compared to 2001. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001, included a charge of $121.0 million related to an agreement with the class in the Engle case. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for information with respect to the Engle action. Excluding this charge, net income decreased by $27.3 million, or 3.4%, due to lower sales volume, increased sales promotion costs and reduced investment income reflecting lower invested cash balances and reduced yields on investments, partially offset by increased unit prices and decreased tobacco settlement and legal expenses. Revenues decreased due to lower net sales and reduced investment income. Net sales decreased by $70.3 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to lower unit sales volume of approximately $257.0 million, or 6.6%, assuming prices were unchanged from the prior year. The decline in unit sales volume was partially offset by higher average unit prices which increased revenues by approximately $186.7 million, or 4.8%, including $93.0 million from an increase in federal excise taxes effective January 1, 2002. During 2002, Lorillard increased its net wholesale price of cigarettes by an average of $6.71 per thousand cigarettes ($0.13 per pack of 20 cigarettes), or 5.6%, before the impact of any promotional activities. Federal excise taxes are included in the price of cigarettes and on January 1, 2002, the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by $2.50 per thousand cigarettes ($0.05 per pack of 20 cigarettes) to $19.50 per thousand cigarettes. 59 The increased unit prices reflect the increase in net wholesale prices, partially offset by promotional expenses, mostly in the form of coupons and other discounts provided to retailers and passed through to the consumer. Increased promotional expenses in 2002, as compared to 2001, partially offset the higher average unit prices in 2002. Lorillards overall unit sales volume decreased 6.3% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Newports unit sales volume decreased by 2.8% in 2002. Continued decreases in unit volume for Old Gold and Maverick in the discount segment were also contributing factors. Old Gold and Maverick declines were due to severe competitive price pressure from deep discount brands produced by manufacturers who do not have the same financial payment obligations related to the State Settlement Agreements as does Lorillard and other major tobacco companies. Additionally, volume in 2002 was affected by generally weak economic conditions and ongoing limitations imposed by Philip Morris retail merchandising arrangements. Deep discount price brands produced by manufacturers who are not obligated by the same payment terms of the State Settlement Agreements have continued to increase their market share by approximately one share point during 2002 to 7.17% of the U.S. domestic market. As a result of lower payments, these companies can price their brands at a significant advantage, by as much as 60%, as compared with offerings from the major cigarette manufacturers. Lorillards share of domestic U.S. wholesale cigarette shipments was 9.05% in 2002 as compared to 9.26% in 2001. Newport, a premium brand, accounted for approximately 88% of Lorillards unit sales and 89% of net sales revenue in 2002, compared to 85% and 86%, respectively, in 2001. Newports share of the premium segment was 10.9% in 2002 as compared to 10.6% in 2001. Newport had the highest share of the menthol segment of the market with an approximately 31% share of the category. Menthol comprised approximately 26% of total domestic U.S. industry sales in 2002. Premium priced cigarette sales accounted for 94.7% and 92.4% of Lorillards total sales in 2002 and 2001. Overall, industry unit sales volume decreased by 3.7% in 2002. Industry sales for premium brands declined to 72.8% in 2002 as compared to 74.0% in 2001. Lorillard recorded pretax charges of $1,062.2 and $1,140.4 million ($646.1 and $694.2 million after taxes), for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, to record its obligations under various settlement agreements. Lorillards portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and related legal fees are based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of manufactured products sold as the related sales occur. The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on Lorillard and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes. The Company believes that the implementation of the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect its consolidated results of operations and cash flows in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rates of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments, Lorillards share of the domestic premium and discount segments, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to all of the payments of the State Settlement Agreements. During the first quarter of 2002, Lorillard adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00 25 and No. 00 14 relating to the classification of vendor consideration and certain sales incentives. As a result, promotional expenses historically included in other operating expenses have been reclassified primarily as reductions of revenues from manufactured products, or to cost of manufactured products sold. Prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. Adoption of the EITF issues had no impact on the results of operations and cash flows of Lorillard. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues increased by $85.1 million, or 2.2% and net income decreased $81.7 million, or 10.8%, in 2001 as compared to 2000. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001, included a charge of $121.0 million to record the effect of the Engle agreement. Excluding this charge, net income would have increased by $39.3 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to 2000, due to the impact of wholesale price increases, partially offset by lower unit sales volume and increased sales promotional expenses, mostly in the form of coupons and other discounts provided to retailers and passed through to the consumer. 60 Revenues increased due to higher net sales, partially offset by reduced investment income. Net sales increased by $106.5 million in 2001 as compared to 2000, due to higher average unit prices which would have resulted in an aggregate increase of approximately $399.2 million, or 10.6%, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $292.7 million, or 7.8%, reflecting lower unit sales volume. During 2001, Lorillard increased its net wholesale price of cigarettes by an average of $13.58 per thousand cigarettes ($0.27 per pack of 20 cigarettes), or 12.8%, before the impact of any promotional activities. Federal excise taxes are included in the price of cigarettes and remained constant during 2001 at $17.00 per thousand units, or $0.34 per pack of 20 cigarettes. Lorillards overall unit sales volume decreased by 6.5% in 2001, as compared to 2000. Newports unit sales volume increased by 0.4% for 2001, primarily as a result of the introduction of the Newport Medium line extension and strengthened promotional support, as compared to 2000. The decrease in Lorillards overall unit sales volume reflects lower unit sales of its Maverick and Old Gold brands in the discount market segment due primarily to increased competition in the discount segment and continued limitations imposed by Philip Morriss merchandising arrangements and general competitive conditions. Overall, industry unit sales volume decreased by 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Lorillards share of domestic U.S. wholesale cigarette shipments was 9.26% in 2001, as compared to 9.63% for 2000. Newport, a premium brand, accounted for approximately 85% of Lorillards unit sales and 86% of net sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 79% and 82%, respectively, in 2000. Newports market share of the premium segment was 10.6% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 10.3% in 2000. Lorillard recorded pretax charges of $1,140.4 and $1,076.5 million ($694.2 and $642.3 million after taxes), for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, to record its obligations under various settlement agreements. Loews Hotels Loews Hotels Holding Corporation and subsidiaries ("Loews Hotels"). Loews Hotels Holding Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 2002 Compared with 2001 Revenues and net income decreased by $16.5 and $6.8 million, or 5.1% and 34.9%, respectively, in 2002 as compared to 2001. Revenues decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001, due primarily to a decline in revenue per available room, reduced investment income, and lower other hotel operating revenues. Revenue per available room decreased by $5.41, or 4.4%, to $117.62 due primarily to lower average room rates and reflects the continued economic weakness and its impact on the travel industry. Revenue per available room is an industry measure of the combined effect of occupancy rates and average room rates on room revenues. Other hotel operating revenues include, among other items, guest charges for food and beverages, telecommunication services, garage and parking fees. Net income decreased in 2002 due to the lower revenues and pre opening costs incurred related to the Royal Pacific Hotel at Universal Orlando, partially offset by improved operating results at the Universal Orlando properties and lower interest expense. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues and net income decreased by $16.7 and $7.3 million, or 4.9% and 27.2%, respectively, in 2001 as compared to 2000. Revenues decreased primarily due to lower occupancy rates and lower average room rates, partially offset by the addition of the Philadelphia Hotel, which commenced operations in spring of 2000. The decline in revenues reflects the continued economic weakness and the impact that the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attack had on the travel 61 industry. Net income decreased due primarily to lower revenues and increased depreciation expenses related to the Philadelphia Hotel, partially offset by lower advertising and administrative expenses and lower pre opening costs. Diamond Offshore Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Diamond Offshore"). Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. is a 54% owned subsidiary of the Company. Diamond Offshores revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease. Revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, Diamond Offshore may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. During periods of mobilization, however, revenues may be adversely affected. In response to changes in demand, Diamond Offshore may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase revenues, respectively. Revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met. Income is recognized on the completed contract method. Provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract. Operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, Diamond Offshore may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, Diamond Offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically a cost of the operator under drilling contracts. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, Diamond Offshore may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to "cold stack" the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. 2002 Compared with 2001 Revenues decreased by $197.2 million, or 20.1% and net income decreased by $56.9 million, or 80.1%, respectively, in 2002 as compared to 2001. Revenues decreased due primarily to lower contract drilling revenue of $161.1 million, reduced investment income of $18.9 million, and lower revenues from reimbursable expenses. Revenues from high specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs decreased by $95.4 million, or 9.7% in 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease reflects lower dayrates ($60.7 million) and lower utilization ($70.4 million) partially offset by revenues generated by the Ocean Baroness ($35.7 million), which completed a conversion to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in March of 2002. Revenues from jack up rigs decreased by $75.1 million, or 7.7%, due primarily to decreased dayrates ($48.6 million) and lower utilization ($26.5 million) in 2002. Interest income decreased by $18.9 million, or 1.9%, in 2002 primarily due to a reduction in marketable securities held and lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities in 2002 compared to 2001. Net income decreased due primarily to the reduced revenues in 2002 as discussed above, partially offset by lower interest expenses related to a premium paid on early extinguishment of debt in 2001. In 2002 Diamond Offshore implemented EITF 01 14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expense Incurred." EITF 01 14 requires a company to record the gross amount billed to its customers as revenue as opposed to a reduction of expenses. Diamond Offshore has reclassified its prior periods for comparative purposes. 62 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues increased by $232.7 million, or 31.1%, and net income increased by $39.0 million, in 2001 as compared to 2000. Revenues and net income included a gain from the sale of a drilling rig of $13.9 and $4.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000. Revenues from high specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs increased by $179.3 million, or 24.0%, in 2001 as compared to 2000. These increases reflect higher utilization ($23.6 million) and dayrates ($94.2 million) for 2001 as compared 2000. Revenue generated by the Ocean Confidence ($61.5 million), which began a five year drilling program in the Gulf of Mexico on January 5, 2001 after completion of a conversion to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit, also contributed to the increase in revenues. Revenues from jack up rigs increased by $55.6 million, or 7.4%, due primarily to increased dayrates ($63.6 million) for 2001, partially offset by lower utilization in 2001. Net income increased due primarily to the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased interest and depreciation expenses. Depreciation expenses increased in 2001 primarily due to the Ocean Confidence, which completed its conversion from an accommodation vessel to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in January 2001. In addition, interest expense increased due to a premium paid on early extinguishment of debt and increased interest expense due to the Ocean Confidence, as a result of less interest capitalized. Bulova Bulova Corporation and subsidiaries ("Bulova"). Bulova Corporation is a 97% owned subsidiary of the Company. 2002 Compared with 2001 Revenues and net income increased by $19.5 and $1.7 million, or 13.3% and 16.8%, respectively, in 2002 compared to 2001. Revenues and net income increased primarily as a result of the addition of the Wittnauer watch brand, acquired in 2001, and the commencement in 2002 of the Harley Davidson watch line resulting from a licensing agreement signed in 2001. An increase in clock unit volume sales, partially offset by a decrease in Bulovas watch brand unit volume, also contributed to the increase in revenues and net income. These increases were partially offset by lower royalty income of $0.7 million and decreased interest income of $0.7 million in 2002. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues and net income decreased by $14.0 and $4.9 million, or 8.7% and 32.7%, respectively, in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues and net income decreased due primarily to royalty income of $5.5 and $3.0 million, respectively, reported in 2000 related to the settlement of a contract dispute. The remaining decline in revenues for 2001 reflects lower watch and clock unit sales volume due primarily to the continued economic downturn, partially offset by higher watch unit prices. Net income decreased due to the lower revenues and costs incurred during business process reengineering of Bulovas information systems, partially offset by improved gross margins attributable to Bulovas product sales mix. Corporate Corporate operations consist primarily of investment income, including investment gains (losses) from non insurance subsidiaries, as well as equity earnings from Majestic Shipping Corporation ("Majestic"), corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative costs. Majestic, a wholly owned subsidiary, owns a 49% common stock interest in Hellespont Shipping Corporation ("Hellespont"). Hellespont is engaged in the business of owning and operating six ultra large crude oil tankers that are used primarily to transport crude oil from the Persian Gulf to a limited number of ports in the Far East, Northern Europe and the United States. 63 The components of investment gains (losses) included in Corporate operations are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Derivative instruments $ (14.1) $ 18.2 $(146.5) Equity securities, including short positions (41.2) 69.1 125.1 Short term investments 73.3 28.5 (3.3) Other 25.5 12.6 17.3 43.5 128.4 (7.4) Income tax (expense) benefit (16.1) (45.0) 2.6 Minority interest (11.1) (8.3) Net gain (loss) $ 16.3 $ 75.1 $ (4.8) 2002 Compared with 2001 Exclusive of investment gains (losses), revenues decreased $81.6 million and net loss increased $51.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Revenues declined due primarily to lower results from Majestic of $41.7 million reflecting reduced demand and charter rates in the crude oil tanker markets, and lower investment income of $41.6 million relating to reduced yields from invested assets. The impact of the lower results from shipping operations and investment income increased the net loss by $35.4 and $21.9 million, respectively. 2001 Compared with 2000 Exclusive of investment gains (losses), revenues decreased $19.1 million and net loss increased $3.0 million, or 11.5% and 21.1%, respectively, in 2001 compared to 2000, due primarily to lower investment income. This change was partially offset by increased operating results from Majestic reflecting increased demand and charter rates in the crude oil tanker markets. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys contractual cash payment obligations are as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than More than December 31, 2002 Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Long term debt $ 5,672.4 $ 430.6 $ 825.0 $ 1,772.6 $ 2,644.2 Capital lease obligations 35.6 2.4 5.7 7.2 20.3 Operating leases 556.7 91.9 140.0 102.2 222.6 Total $ 6,264.7 $ 524.9 $ 970.7 $ 1,882.0 $ 2,887.1 In addition, as previously discussed, Lorillard has entered into the State Settlement Agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on Lorillard and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers. Lorillards portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and related legal fees are based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur. CNA The principal operating cash flow sources of CNAs property and casualty and life insurance subsidiaries are premiums and investment income. The primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses. 64 For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,039.9 million as compared with net cash used in operating activities of $599.0 million in 2001. The improvement related primarily to federal tax refunds received in 2002 as compared to taxes paid in 2001 and decreased net payments for insurance claims. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash used for operating activities was $599.0 million as compared with net cash used of $1,345.5 million in 2000. The improvement related primarily to decreased paid claims. Cash flows from investing activities include purchases and sales of financial instruments, as well as the purchase and sale of land, buildings, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash used for investing activities was $1,488.0 million as compared with $205.0 million in 2001. Cash flows used by investing activities were related principally to increased purchases of invested assets due to positive operating cash flow and cash provided by financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash used for investing activities was $205.0 million as compared with net cash inflows of $1,842.0 million in 2000. Cash flows for investing activities were related principally to increased net purchases of invested assets related to investing $1.0 billion of proceeds from the common stock rights offering completed in the third quarter of 2001. Cash flows from financing activities include proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities, outflows for dividends or repayment of debt and outlays to reacquire equity instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided from financing activities was $432.0 million as compared with $783.0 million in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash provided from financing activities was $783.0 million as compared with $487.0 million of net cash used in 2000. On December 19, 2002 CNA received $750.0 million from the Company in exchange for 7,500 shares of Series H Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Preferred Issue"). Of the proceeds from the Preferred Issue, $250.0 million was used to prepay the $250.0 million one year bank term loan due April 29, 2003 and an additional $250.0 million was contributed to CCC to improve its statutory surplus. It is expected that the rest of the proceeds will be used to repay other debt of CNA and CIC, a CNA controlled subsidiary, maturing in 2003 and for other general corporate purposes. CNA completed a common stock rights offering on September 26, 2001, successfully raising $1,006.0 million (40.3 million shares sold at $25.00 per share). The Company purchased 38.3 million shares issued in connection with the rights offering for $957.0 million, and an additional 0.8 million shares in the open market. Additionally, CNA borrowed $500.0 million against its bank credit facility. Partially offsetting these cash inflows were reductions to CNAs commercial paper borrowings of $627.0 million. CNA is closely managing the cash flows related to claims and reinsurance recoverables from the WTC event. It is anticipated that significant claim payments will be made prior to receipt of the corresponding reinsurance recoverables. CNA does not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from these payments. As of March 14, 2003, the Company has paid $488.0 million in claims and recovered $237.0 million from reinsurers. CNAs estimated gross pretax losses for the WTC event were $1,648.0 million pretax ($958.3 million after tax and minority interest). Net pretax losses before the effect of corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties were $727.0 million. Approximately 1.0%, 73.0% and 20.0% of the reinsurance recoverables on the estimated losses related to the WTC event are from companies with Standard & Poors ("S&P") ratings of AAA, AA or A. Effective January 30, 2001, CNA sold the 180 Maiden Lane, New York, facility. The sale of this property provided additional liquidity to CNA with net sale proceeds of $264.0 million. CNA has an existing shelf registration statement under which it may issue an aggregate of $549.0 million of debt or equity securities, declared effective by the SEC. 65 CNA has a $250.0 million three year bank credit facility with an April 30, 2004 expiration date. CNA previously had a $250.0 million 364 day facility with an expiration date of April 29, 2002. An option to convert the 364 day facility to a one year term loan was exercised in April of 2002. The term loan was subsequently prepaid on December 23, 2002. CNA pays a facility fee to the lenders for having funds available for loans under the three year credit facility maturing April 30, 2004. The fee varies based on the long term debt ratings of CNA. At December 31, 2002, the facility fee on the three year component was 17.5 basis points. CNA pays interest on any outstanding debt/borrowings under the three year facility based on a rate determined using the long term debt ratings of CNA. The interest rate is equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 57.5 basis points. Further, if CNA has outstanding loans greater than 50.0% of the amounts available under the three year facility, CNA will also pay a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on such loans. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility, including facility fees and utilization fees, was 2.3% and 3.1%. A Moodys downgrade of the CNA senior debt rating from Baa2 to Baa3 would increase the facility fee on the three year component of the facility from 17.5 basis points to 25.0 basis points. The applicable interest rate would increase from LIBOR plus 57.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 75.0 basis points. The utilization fee would remain unchanged on the three year facility at 12.5 basis points. On September 30, 2002, CNA Surety Corporation, a 64.0% owned and consolidated subsidiary of CNA, entered into a $65.0 million credit agreement with one bank, which consisted of a $35.0 million 364 day revolving credit facility and a $30.0 million three year term loan payable semi annually at the rate of $5.0 million. The credit agreement replaced a $130.0 million five year revolving credit facility that terminated September 30, 2002. The new credit facility was fully utilized at inception. The terms of the new credit facility agreement required the assumption by a second bank of $15.0 million of the credit risk by November 30, 2002 or CNA Surety would be required to repay $15.0 million to reduce the amount of the credit facility commitment from $35.0 million to $20.0 million. On November 29, 2002, CNA Surety repaid $11.0 million of the outstanding borrowings and arranged for the due date on the remaining $4.0 million to be delayed to March 31, 2003. A second bank subsequently assumed $10.0 million of the credit risk resulting in an additional $6.0 million of outstanding borrowings, leaving the credit facility commitment at $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2002, the revolving credit facility was fully utilized. Under the new credit facility agreement, CNA Surety pays a facility fee of 12.5 basis points, interest at LIBOR plus 45.0 basis points, and for utilization greater than 50.0% of the amount available to borrow an additional fee of 5.0 basis points. On the term loan, CNA Surety pays interest at LIBOR plus 62.5 basis points. At December 31, 2002, the weighted average interest rate on the $60.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement, including facility fees and utilization fees was 2.0%. Under the former credit facility agreement, CNA Surety paid interest on outstanding borrowings based on, among other rates, LIBOR plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin was determined by CNAs leverage ratio (debt to total capitalization). At the termination date of the old facility, the applicable margin was 30.0 basis points, including the 10.0 basis point facility fee. At December 31, 2001, the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility, including facility fees, was 2.6%. The terms of CNAs and CNA Suretys credit facilities require CNA and CNA Surety to maintain certain financial ratios and combined property and casualty company statutory surplus levels. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, CNA and CNA Surety were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants. In December of 2002 and January of 2003, CNA provided loans in an aggregate amount of approximately $45.0 million to a large national contractor that undertakes projects for the construction of government and private facilities. CNA Surety has provided significant surety bond protection for projects by this contractor through surety bonds underwritten by CCC or its affiliates. The loans were provided by CNA to help the contractor meet its liquidity needs. The loans are evidenced by demand notes and currently accrue interest at 10.0% until replaced by the credit facility 66 described below. The contractor and certain of its affiliates have pledged to CNA substantially all of their assets as collateral for these loans. In March of 2003, CNA entered into an agreement with the contractor to provide an $86.4 million credit facility, which includes the already advanced $45.0 million described above. The credit facility and all loans thereunder would mature in March of 2006. Advances under the credit facility, including the already funded $45.0 million, bear interest at the prime rate plus 6.0%. Payment of 3.0% interest would be deferred until the credit facility matures, and the remainder would be paid monthly in cash. Loans under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the contractor and certain affiliates. The Company and CNA have entered into a participation agreement, pursuant to which the Company has purchased a participation interest in one third of the loans and commitments under the new credit facility, on a dollar for dollar basis, up to a maximum of $25.0 million. Although the Company does not have rights against the contractor directly under the participation agreement, it shares recoveries and fees under the facility proportionally with CNA. In March of 2003, CNA also purchased the contractors outstanding bank debt for $16.4 million. Under the new credit facility, the contractor agreed to purchase from CNA and retire the bank debt for $16.4 million, with $11.4 million of the purchase price being funded under the new credit facility and $5.0 million from money loaned to the contractor by its shareholders. Under its purchase agreement with the banks, CNA is also required to reimburse the banks for any draws upon approximately $6.5 million in outstanding letters of credit issued by the banks for the contractors benefit that expire between May and August of 2003. Any CNA reimbursements for draws upon the banks letters of credit will become obligations of the contractor to CNA as draws upon the credit facility. The contractor has initiated a restructuring plan that is intended to reduce costs and improve cash flow, and a chief restructuring officer has been appointed to manage execution of the plan. CNA, through its affiliate CNA Surety, intends to continue to provide surety bonds on behalf of the contractor during this restructuring period, subject to the contractors initial and ongoing compliance with CNA Suretys underwriting standards. Any losses arising from bonds issued or assumed by the insurance subsidiaries of CNA Surety to the contractor are excluded from CNA Suretys $40.0 million excess of $20.0 million per principal reinsurance program with unaffiliated reinsurers in place in 2002. As a result, CNA Surety retains the first $60.0 million of losses on bonds written with an effective date of September 30, 2002 and prior, and CCC will incur 100% of losses above that retention level on bonds with effective dates prior to September 30, 2002. Through facultative reinsurance contracts with CCC, CNA Suretys exposure on bonds written from October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 has been limited to $20.0 million per bond. Indemnification and subrogation rights, including rights to contract proceeds on construction projects in the event of default, exist that reduce CNA Suretys and ultimately CNAs exposure to loss. While CNA believes that the contractors restructuring efforts may be successful and provide sufficient cash flow for its operations and repayment of its borrowings, the contractors failure to achieve its restructuring plan could have a material adverse effect on CNAs future results of operations. If such failures occur CNA estimates the Surety loss, net of indemnification and subrogation recoveries, but before the effects of corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, if any, and minority interest could be up to $200.0 million. In the normal course of business, CNA has obtained letters of credit in favor of various unaffiliated insurance companies, regulatory authorities and other entities. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 there were approximately $222.0 and $270.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. CNA has provided guarantees related to irrevocable standby letters of credit for certain of its subsidiaries. Certain of these subsidiaries have been sold; however, the irrevocable standby letter of credit guarantees remain in effect. CNA would be required to remit prompt payment on the letters of credit in question if the primary obligor drew down on these letters of credit and failed to repay such loans in accordance with the terms of the letters of credit. The maximum potential amount of future payments that CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees is approximately $30.0 million at December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, CNA had committed approximately $141.0 and $152.0 million for future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. 67 In the normal course of investing activities, CCC had committed approximately $51.0 million as of December 31, 2002 to future capital calls from certain of its unconsolidated affiliates in exchange for an ownership interest in such affiliates. The Company has a commitment to purchase up to a $100.0 million floating rate note issued by the California Earthquake Authority in the event of an earthquake during calendar year 2003 that results in California earthquake related losses greater than $4.2 billion. As of December 31, 2002, CNA is obligated to make future payments totaling $394.0 million for non cancelable operating leases expiring from 2003 through 2014 primarily for office space and data processing, office and transportation equipment. Estimated future minimum payments under these contracts are as follows: $79.0 million in 2003; $61.0 million in 2004; $56.0 million in 2005; and $45.0 million in 2006; $153.0 million in 2007 and beyond. Additionally, CNA has entered into a limited number of guaranteed payment contracts, primarily relating to telecommunication services, amounting to approximately $24.0 million. Estimated future minimum purchases under these contracts are as follows: $13.0 million in 2003; $9.0 million in 2004; and $2.0 million in 2005. In certain circumstances CNA provides guarantees of the indebtedness of certain of its independent insurance producers, which expire in 2002. CNA would be required to remit prompt and complete payment when due, should the primary obligor default. In the event of default on the part of the primary obligor, CNA holds an interest in and to any and all shares of common stock of the primary obligor. The maximum potential amount of future payments that CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees are approximately $7.0 million at December 31, 2002. CNA has provided parent company guarantees, which expire in 2015, related to lease obligations of certain subsidiaries. Certain of those subsidiaries have been sold; however, the lease obligation guarantees remain in effect. CNA would be required to remit prompt payment on leases in question if the primary obligor fails to observe and perform its covenants under the lease agreements. The maximum potential amount of future payments that CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees are approximately $8.0 million at December 31, 2002. CNA holds an investment in a real estate joint venture that is accounted for on the equity basis of accounting. In the normal course of business, CNA on a joint and several basis with other unrelated insurance company shareholders have committed to continue funding the operating deficits of this joint venture. Additionally, CNA and the other unrelated shareholders, on a joint and several basis, have guaranteed an operating lease for an office building, which expires in 2016. The guarantee of the operating lease is a parallel guarantee to the commitment to fund operating deficits; consequently, the separate guarantee to the lessor is not expected to be triggered as long as the joint venture continues to be funded by its shareholders and continues to make its annual lease payments. In the event that the other parties to the joint venture are unable to meet their commitments in funding the operations of this joint venture, CNA would be required to assume the obligation for the entire office building operating lease. The maximum potential future lease payments at December 31, 2002 that CNA could be required to pay under this guarantee is approximately $333.0 million. If CNA was required to assume the entire lease obligation, CNA would have the right to pursue reimbursement from the other shareholders and would have the right to all sublease revenues. CNA has recorded a liability of approximately $10.0 million for its share of estimated future operating deficits of this joint venture through 2016. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNAs insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies, and these ratings reflect the rating agencys opinion of the insurance companys financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating. One or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of CNAs insurance subsidiaries. If those ratings were downgraded as a result, the Companys results of operations and or equity could be materially adversely impacted. 68 The table below reflects ratings issued by A.M. Best, S&P, Moodys and Fitch as of February 24, 2003 for the CCC Pool, CIC Pool, CAC Pool and CNAGLA. Also rated were CNAs senior debt and commercial paper and Continental senior debt. Insurance Financial Strength Ratings Debt Ratings Property and Casualty Life & Group Senior Debt CCC Pool CIC Pool CAC Pool CNAGLA CNA Continental A.M. Best A A A A bbb bbb Fitch A A AA A+ BBB BBB Moodys A3 A3 A2 NR Baa2 Baa3 (Negative)* S&P A A A NR BBB BBB NR Not Rated All rating outlooks on the above ratings are stable unless otherwise noted. * CAC and VFL are rated separately by Moodys and both have an A2 rating. During the fourth quarter of 2002, A.M. Best and Fitch affirmed the existing financial strength ratings of each of the insurance pools and the debt ratings of CNA as noted in the above table. In February of 2003, S&P affirmed the ratings of the property and casualty pools, CCC and CIC, and downgraded the life pool, CAC, by one notch from A+ to A. S&P cited that the downgrade of the life operations was primarily because S&P wanted to bring the ratings on all the companies in the group closer together and because the companies business profile has changed over the past two years. Corporate bonds comprise a significant portion of CNAs investment portfolio. CNA regularly reviews the market value of these securities, and challenges whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred for securities that are trading below cost (see Investments section, below). In light of the current volatility in the financial markets and the dramatic impact that several recent accounting scandals have had on specific issuers, CNA may be subject to future impairment losses that could materially adversely impact the Companys results of operations. Any future impairment losses would not have a material impact on the Companys equity. See the discussion of CNAs impairment committee in the investment section that follows. CNAs ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to CNA by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiarys domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments. Dividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval of the Department, may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2002, CCCs earned surplus is in a positive position, thereby enabling CCC to pay approximately $1,069.0 million of dividend payments during 2003 that would not be subject to the Departments prior approval. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company. CCCs positive earned surplus at December 31, 2002 is contrasted to its negative earned surplus position at December 31, 2001. Prompted, in part, by the negative earned surplus position at December 31, 2001, CNA embarked on a capital realignment initiative within the CCC intercompany reinsurance pool ("Pool") during 2002, the benefits of which included the restoration of CCCs earned surplus to a positive position. This initiative involved the payment of dividends to CCC from its insurance subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2002. As a result of this distribution of the cumulative earnings of CCCs insurance subsidiaries, CCCs earned surplus was restored to a positive level at December 31, 2002, approximating $1,069.0 million. 69 This initiative involved a change to the underwriting structure of CCC and eight of its subsidiaries from the Pool structure to a structure in which CCC assumes 100% of the net underwriting risks of the group of companies formerly comprising the pool. This is CNAs first step in a multi year project to reduce duplicative legal entities, thereby facilitating more efficient operations and cost savings. In addition, by agreement with the New Hampshire Insurance Department, as well as certain other state insurance departments, dividend payments for the CIC pool are restricted to internal and external debt service requirements through September 2003 up to a maximum of $85.0 million annually, without the prior approval of the New Hampshire Insurance Department. CNAs domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements. Risk based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of risk based capital specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a companys actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk based capital results, as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum risk based capital requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, all of CNAs domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements. Lorillard Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation and regulatory issues. Approximately 4,500 product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United States. Of these, approximately 1,100 cases are pending in a West Virginia court, and approximately 2,800 cases have been brought by flight attendants alleging injury from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Lorillard is a defendant in all of the flight attendant suits served to date and is a defendant in most of the cases pending in West Virginia. The terms of the State Settlement Agreements require significant payments to be made to the Settling States which began in 1998 and continue in perpetuity. Lorillards cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2002 was approximately $1.0 billion. In 2003, Lorillard anticipates its payments under the State Settlement Agreements to range from $750.0 to $800.0 million in accordance with the terms of those agreements. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding this settlement and other litigation matters. Lorillards marketable securities totaled $1,640.7 and $1,628.9 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2002, fixed maturity securities represented 92.8% of the total investment in marketable securities including 71.3% invested in Treasury Bills with an average duration of 60 days and 11.4% invested in money market accounts. The principal source of liquidity for Lorillards business and operating needs is internally generated funds from its operations. Lorillard generated net cash flow from operations of approximately $852.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $709.7 million for the prior year. The increased cash flow in 2002 reflects the absence of cash payments made in 2001 related to the Engle agreement and reduced inventory purchases. Lorillard believes based on current conditions, that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to enable it to meet its obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund its capital expenditures. Lorillard cannot predict the impact on its cash flows of cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, or the impact of subsequent legislative actions, and thus can give no assurance that it will be able to meet all of those requirements. Loews Hotels In 2002, Loews Hotels, with its partners, opened a third hotel at Universal Orlando in Florida. Capital expenditures in relation to these hotel projects have been funded by a combination of equity from Loews Hotels and its partners, and mortgages. 70 Funds from operations continue to exceed operating requirements. Funds for other capital expenditures and working capital requirements are expected to be provided from existing cash balances and operations. Diamond Offshore Diamond Offshore operates in an industry that is historically extremely competitive and deeply cyclical. The demand for its services has traditionally been highly correlated with the price of oil and natural gas. However the rise in product prices that began in late 2001 and continued throughout 2002 did not yield the expected improvements in utilization and dayrates for Diamond Offshores equipment. At December 31, 2002, Diamond Offshores cash and marketable securities totaled $812.5 million, down from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Cash of $199.1 million generated by repurchase agreements is included at December 31, 2001. Cash provided by operating activities was $281.2 million in 2002, compared to $374.0 million in 2001. The decline is primarily due to reduced net income in 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Diamond Offshore spent $187.7 million, including capitalized interest expense, for rig upgrades. These expenditures were primarily for the deepwater upgrade of the Ocean Rover ($98.4 million) which is expected to be completed in July 2003, upgrades to six of Diamond Offshores jack ups ($50.7 million) of which three were completed during 2002 and three are expected to be completed during 2003, and the deepwater upgrade of the Ocean Baroness ($31.4 million) which was completed in March 2002. Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately $123 million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during 2003 for the completion of the Ocean Rover upgrade ($80.0 million) and the three remaining jack up upgrades ($43.0 million). The significant upgrade of Diamond Offshores semisubmersible rig, the Ocean Baroness, to high specification capabilities resulted in an enhanced version of Diamond Offshores previous Victory class upgrades. The upgrade was similar to the upgrade being performed on the Ocean Rover. Diamond Offshore took delivery of the Ocean Baroness in January 2002. The approximate cost of the upgrade was $169.0 million. In 2002 Diamond Offshore began a two year program to expand the capabilities of its jack up fleet by significantly upgrading six of its 14 jack up rigs. Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately $100.0 million on the program, and as of December 31, 2002, has spent $57.0 million. All of Diamond Offshores upgrade projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns that are inherent in any large construction project. Diamond Offshore purchased the semisubmersible drilling rig Omega for $65.0 million in the first quarter of 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Diamond Offshore spent $86.1 million in association with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and to meet other corporate requirements. These expenditures included purchases of drill pipe, anchor chain, riser and other drilling equipment. In addition, Diamond Offshore spent $68.5 million for the purchase of the third generation semisubmersible drilling rig, West Vanguard, renamed Ocean Vanguard. Diamond Offshore has budgeted $111.3 million for 2003 capital expenditures associated with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate requirements. Cash required to meet Diamond Offshores capital commitments is determined by evaluating rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating Diamond Offshores ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is the opinion of Diamond Offshores management that operating cash flows and existing cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, periodic assessments will be made based on industry conditions. In addition, Diamond Offshore may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Diamond Offshores ability to issue any such securities will be dependent on Diamond Offshores results of operations, its current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control. 71 Bulova For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash utilized by operations was $7.3 million as compared to net cash provided of $15.9 million in 2001. The decrease in net cash flow is primarily the result of an increase in inventory purchases related to the introduction of the Wittnauer product line, the Harley Davidson licensed product, and the corresponding increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales volume. These increases were partially offset by a change in timing of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Bulovas cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments amounted to $10.1 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $18.9 million at December 31, 2001. Bulova and the Company have a credit agreement which provides, under terms and conditions set forth therein, for unsecured loans to Bulova by the Company from time to time, in principal amounts aggregating up to $50.0 million. Bulova has not utilized this credit agreement since 1995 and there are no amounts outstanding. Bulova may require working capital advances under this credit agreement to fund its capital expenditures and working capital requirements associated with product line extensions and international expansion efforts. Majestic Shipping During 2002 subsidiaries of Hellespont acquired from a Korean shipyard three new 442,500 deadweight ton, ultra large crude carrying ships. A fourth such ship has been contracted for with delivery expected by the end of the first quarter of 2003. These subsidiaries were purchased by Hellespont from Majestic at the Companys carrying value, excluding pretax capitalized interest expense of $3.1 million, in March 2002. In partial consideration for this purchase, Hellespont issued to Majestic a promissory note in the principal amount of $57.5 million, which remains outstanding. The total cost of the three ships delivered in 2002 amounted to approximately $277.8 million, and the fourth ship is expected to cost approximately $93.0 million. Each ship has been, or is expected to be, financed in part by $50.0 million of bank debt, for an aggregate amount of up to $200.0 million of bank debt, guaranteed by Hellespont. As of December 31, 2002, $150.0 million principal amount of this debt was outstanding. The Company has agreed to provide credit support for this bank debt by making available to the borrowers an operating cash flow credit facility of up to an aggregate amount of $25.0 million, none of which is outstanding. Parent Company On February 6, 2002, the Company sold 40.3 million shares of a new class of its common stock, referred to as Carolina Group stock, for net proceeds of $1.1 billion. Proceeds from this sale have been allocated to the Loews Group and were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2002, there were 185,441,200 shares of Loews Common Stock outstanding. During 2002, the Company purchased 6,065,600 shares of Loews Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $343.5 million. During 2002, the Company purchased 2,717,876 shares of CNA common stock at an aggregate cost of $73.1 million. The Company also purchased 340,000 shares of Carolina Group Stock during 2002, for the account of the Carolina Group, at an aggregate cost of $7.7 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time may purchase shares of its, and its subsidiaries, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. In addition, in December 2002 the Company purchased from CNA $750.0 million of CNA series H cumulative preferred stock. The Company continues to pursue conservative financial strategies while seeking opportunities for responsible growth. These include the expansion of existing businesses, full or partial acquisitions and dispositions, and opportunities for efficiencies and economies of scale. INVESTMENTS Investment activities of non insurance companies include investments in fixed income securities, equity securities including short sales, derivative instruments and short term investments, and are carried at fair value. Equity securities, which are considered part of the Companys trading portfolio, short sales and derivative instruments are marked to market and reported as investment gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company enters into short sales and invests in certain derivative instruments for a number of purposes, including: (i) asset and liability management activities, (ii) income enhancements for its portfolio management strategy, and (iii) to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. 72 Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with the Companys portfolio strategy. The credit exposure associated with these instruments is generally limited to the positive market value of the instruments and will vary based on changes in market prices. The Company enters into these transactions with large financial institutions and considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote. The Company does not believe that any of the derivative instruments utilized by it are unusually complex, nor do these instruments contain embedded leverage features which would expose the Company to a higher degree of risk. See "Results of Operations," "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information with respect to derivative instruments, including recognized gains and losses on these instruments. Insurance The significant components of CNAs investment income are presented in the following table: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Fixed maturity securities $ 1,854.1 $ 1,823.3 $ 1,738.7 Short term investments 62.2 134.7 200.6 Limited partnerships (33.9) 47.3 293.0 Equity securities 65.4 37.0 51.0 Interest on funds withheld and other deposits (239.6) (241.4) (86.9) Other 81.6 113.5 97.9 Total investment income 1,789.8 1,914.4 2,294.3 Investment expenses (59.9) (58.3) (47.8) Investment income net $ 1,729.9 $ 1,856.1 $ 2,246.5 CNA experienced lower investment income in 2002 as compared with 2001. The decrease was due primarily to decreased limited partnership results and lower investment yields, partially offset by $34.0 million of dividend income from Canary Wharf Group plc ("Canary Wharf"). See the Reinsurance section above for additional information for interest costs on funds withheld and other deposits, which is included in investment income, net. The interest costs on these contracts increased significantly in 2001 because of ceded losses resulting from the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening and the WTC event. The decline in limited partnership income was primarily attributable to many of the same factors that impacted the broader financial markets. Limited partnership investment performance, particularly high yield bond and equity strategies, was adversely affected by overall market volatility including concerns over corporate accounting practices and credit deterioration. CNA experienced lower investment income in 2001 as compared with 2000 due primarily to the decrease in limited partnership income as well as the increase in interest on funds withheld and other deposits. The decline in limited partnership income was primarily attributable to many of the same factors that impacted the broader financial markets. The bond segment of the investment portfolio yielded 6.0% in 2002, 6.4% in 2001 and 6.7% in 2000. 73 The components of CNAs net investment (losses) gains are presented in the following table: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Investment (losses) gains: Fixed maturity securities: U.S. government bonds $ 391.6 $ 233.3 $ 95.7 Corporate and other taxable bonds (557.0) (5.3) (171.1) Tax exempt bonds 48.0 53.9 13.1 Asset backed bonds 36.5 75.6 (65.0) Redeemable preferred stock (27.9) (21.5) (3.2) Total fixed maturity securities (108.8) 336.0 (130.5) Equity securities (152.8) 1,094.9 1,116.0 Derivative securities (52.1) (5.0) 10.5 Other invested assets 65.1 (148.9) 35.6 Allocated to participating policyholders and minority interests (3.6) (15.0) (3.5) Total investment (losses) gains (252.2) 1,262.0 1,028.1 Income tax benefit (expense) 103.3 (445.4) (358.6) Minority interest 15.9 (101.8) (87.9) Net investment (losses) gains $ (133.0) $ 714.8 $ 581.6 Net investment results decreased $847.8 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decline was due primarily to the change in net investment gains (losses) on Other Insurance segment taxable bonds and equity securities. The $321.0 million increase in realized losses (after tax and minority interest) of Other Insurance segment taxable bonds relates primarily to impairment charges of $377.0 million recorded in various market sectors, the most significant being the telecommunications sector. The $728.0 million change in net investment gains (losses) (after tax and minority interest) of equity securities relates primarily to CNAs 2001 gain of $566.0 million for the sale of Global Crossing Ltd. common stock ("Global Crossing") and closing of the related hedge agreements. Also included was $140.4 million (after tax and minority interest) of 2002 impairments recorded in various market sectors. Also, during 2002, CNA completed the sale of several businesses, including CNA Re U.K., the London based reinsurer. Included in 2002 net realized investment results was a $62.1 million gain (after tax and minority interest) resulting from the sale of CNA Re U.K., which included a $34.1 million reduction of the previously recognized impairment loss on CNA Re U.K. The impairment loss recorded in 2001 for the sale of CNA Re U.K. and other subsidiaries was $162.0 million after tax and minority interest. Further details of these transactions are discussed below. Net realized investment gains increased $133.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This increase was due primarily to gains from closing the hedge agreements, which were entered into during March 2000, related to CNAs investment in Global Crossing of $566.0 million in 2001 as compared with $274.0 million in 2000 as well as gains of $50.0 million, resulting from the sale of a New York real estate property and gains from the sale of fixed maturity security investments. This improvement was partially offset by estimated losses recorded for the planned dispositions of certain operations, principally CNA Re U.K. described in more detail below as well as decreases in after tax and minority interest gains from the sale of Canary Wharf of $30.0 million in 2001 as compared with $251.0 million in 2000. A primary objective in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities or credit and tax considerations. This activity will produce realized gains and losses. CNA classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) and its equity securities as available for sale, and as such, they are carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in investment income, net. Changes in fair value are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. 74 The following table provides further detail of gross realized gains and losses on fixed maturity and equity securities: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Net realized gains (losses) on fixed maturity and equity securities: Fixed maturity securities: Gross realized gains $ 1,009.0 $ 936.0 $ 434.0 Gross realized losses (1,118.0) (600.0) (564.0) Net realized (losses) gains on fixed maturity securities (109.0) 336.0 (130.0) Equity securities: Gross realized gains 251.0 1,335.0 1,336.0 Gross realized losses (409.0) (240.0) (220.0) Net realized (losses) gains on equity securities (158.0) 1,095.0 1,116.0 Net realized (losses) gains on fixed maturity and equity securities $ (267.0) $ 1,431.0 $ 986.0 The largest realized losses from sales of securities aggregated by issuer for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $254.0 million. The following table provides details of those largest realized losses aggregated by issuer including: the fair value of the securities at sales date, the amount of the loss recorded and the period of time that the security had been in an unrealized loss position prior to sale. The period of time that the security had been in an unrealized loss position prior to sale can vary due to the timing of individual security purchases. A narrative providing the industry sector along with the facts and circumstances giving rise to the loss is provided for each issuer. Fair Months in Value on Unrealized Date of Loss Loss Prior Description of Issuer Sale on Sale to Sale (In millions) U.S. Treasury (a) $ 7,738.0 $ 61.0 Various, 1 24+ An industrial power producer ("IPP") and trader of deregulated energy commodities and energy related risk management products (b) 113.0 46.0 Various, 0 12 A company, which operated moderately priced restaurants in the United States and has filed bankruptcy (c) 28.0 24+ A wireless communication company that offers an integrated tool with digital cellular, text paging and two way radio feature (d) 39.0 18.0 Various, 7 24+ A major U.S. airline carrier that filed for bankruptcy in December of 2002 (e) 11.0 17.0 Various, 0 24+ A large telecommunication company that primarily provides wired and wireless telephone services (f) 182.0 15.0 Various, 0 12 A telecommunication equipment company that builds, designs and delivers network communication (g) 17.0 15.0 0 6 A telephone company located in Canada and is a subsidiary of a U.S. company (h) 5.0 15.0 Various, 0 12 A large cable and telecommunications company located in the U.S. (i) 37.0 14.0 0 6 A provider of employee health and welfare products, administration services, insurance brokerage and related consulting services (j) 37.0 13.0 0 6 A major domestic automobile manufacturer (k) 371.0 12.0 Various, 0 12 $ 8,550.0 $ 254.0 (a) During 2002, the losses recorded in this asset class were due to changes in interest rates and certain trading for duration management purposes. Treasury bonds are used in many portfolios as duration management tools and for liquidity in the course of asset/liability portfolio management. 75 (b) The pressure to the IPP sector began in April of 2002. At July 31, 2002, this issuers financial condition was in good standing. A decision was made to reduce the portfolios overall exposure to this sector including this issuer. (c) The security had been previously impaired and continued to be held in anticipation of proceeds from asset sales and liquidation of restaurant holdings that did not materialize. (d) The issuer anticipated participating in proposed spectrum reallocation that was being reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission. This process was held up in the courts and took longer than expected. The trades that generated the losses took place in the fourth quarter of 2002. The sales were the result of a program to reduce exposures in this sector. (e) Securities currently held have been impaired. These losses relate to trades that took place prior to impairment to reduce issuer exposure and securities with less desirable collateral. (f) These losses were primarily attributable to the sale of fixed income and convertible preferred securities. The bonds were sold in a rapidly deteriorating market due to sector and issuer pressures. (g) These losses were generated by positions primarily held in convertible preferred stock holdings. The price decline reflects the pressures of the issuer, sector and general equity market conditions. (h) A portion of these securities were sold to reduce the overall position in the telecom sector. The issuer reported a deterioration of their financial condition and lost the financial support of its parent. The remaining securities held were impaired when new financial information was revealed in 2002. (i) The losses are related to the sale of securities on early news of alleged fraud and improper accounting practices. The value of securities held fell rapidly and were impaired prior to the issuer filing bankruptcy. (j) The original holding was a private convertible preferred stock. The issuer went public and all equity holders were required to convert to the new common stock. At the time of the initial public offering, market conditions negatively affected the transaction as originally planned. These losses reflect the difference in the market value of the new common shares at the time of issue and the basis of the original invested securities. (k) Losses realized were attributable to reducing exposure to the credit and exchanging owned bonds for newly issued bonds with more desirable maturity structures. Losses represent 3% of the consideration for bonds sold. Invested assets are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets, it is possible that changes in risks in the near term could have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations or equity. A significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary decline in value has occurred. CNA follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value. CNA has established a committee responsible for the impairment process. This committee, referred to as the Impairment Committee, is made up of three officers appointed by CNAs Chief Financial Officer. The Impairment Committee is responsible for analyzing watch list securities on at least a quarterly basis. The watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including, but not limited to, a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors, the business climate or credit ratings. When a security is placed on the watch list, it is monitored for further market value changes and additional news related to the issuers financial condition. The focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors. The decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information. The Impairment Committee considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value, (b) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (c) the intent and ability of CNA to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value, (d) whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and (e) general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors. The Impairment Committees decision to impair a security is primarily based on whether the securitys fair value is likely to remain significantly below its book value in light of all of the factors considered. For securities that are impaired, the security is written down to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized as investment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 76 Realized investment losses included $890.0, $129.0 and $72.0 million of pretax impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The impairments recorded in 2002 were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity markets and the effects on such markets due to the overall slowing of the economy. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds in the communications industry sectors including $129.0 million related to WorldCom Inc., $74.0 million related to Adelphia Communication Corporation, $60.0 million for Charter Communications, $57.0 million for AT&T Canada, and $53.0 million for Telewest PLC. For the year ended December 31, 2001 the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds and equities in the communications industry sector including $31.0 million for MedicaLogic/Medscape, Inc. and $27.0 million for At Home Corporation. For the year ended December 31, 2000 the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds and equities and were largely spread amongst the consumer, financial, and communications industry sectors including $14.0 million for Specialty Foods Corporation. If the deterioration in these industry sectors continues in future periods and CNA continues to hold these securities, CNA is likely to have additional impairments in the future. During the second quarter of 2001, CNA announced its intention to sell certain businesses. The assets being held for disposition included CNA Re U.K. and certain other businesses. Based upon the impairment analyses performed at that time, CNA anticipated that it would realize losses in connection with those planned sales. In determining the anticipated loss from these sales, CNA estimated the net realizable value of each business being held for sale. An estimated loss of $278.4 million (after tax and minority interest) was initially recorded in the second quarter of 2001. This loss was reported in other realized investment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2001, CNA sold certain businesses as planned. The realized after tax loss applicable to these businesses recognized in the second quarter of 2001 was $33.1 million (after tax and minority interest). Revenues of these businesses included in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 totaled approximately $30.0 and $37.0 million. These businesses contributed approximately $9.6 and $6.9 million (after tax and minority interest) of net losses in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. CNA regularly updates its impairment analyses and adjusts its loss as necessary. Based on these updated analyses the impairment loss was reduced by approximately $150.7 million (after tax and minority interest) in the fourth quarter of 2001, primarily because the net assets of the businesses had been significantly diminished by their operating losses, including adverse loss reserve development recognized by CNA Re U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2001. The reduction of the impairment was included in investment gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The statutory surplus of CNA Re U.K. was below the required regulatory minimum surplus level at December 31, 2001. CCC contributed $120.0 million of capital on March 25, 2002 bringing the capital above the regulatory minimum. On October 31, 2002, CNA completed the sale of CNA Re U.K. to Tawa. The sale includes business underwritten since inception by CNA Re U.K., except for certain risks retained by CCC as discussed below. In October, the sale was approved in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority ("FSA") and by the Illinois Insurance Department. This sale does not impact CNA Res on going U.S. based operations. The purchase price was $1, subject to adjustments based primarily upon the results of operations and realized foreign currency losses of CNA Re U.K. The final purchase price adjustments were prepared by Tawa and have been agreed to by CNA. Under the terms of the purchase price adjustment, CCC is entitled to receive $5.0 million from Tawa after Tawa is able to legally withdraw funds from the former CNA Re U.K. entities. CCC has also committed to contribute up to $5.0 million to the former CNA Re U.K. entities over a four year period beginning in 2010 should the FSA deem those entities to be undercapitalized. The purchase price adjustment related to foreign currency losses resulted in CNA contributing additional capital to CNA Re U.K. of $11.0 million. As the sale and related agreements have now been completed, CNA has finalized its impairment analysis based upon the terms of the completed transactions. As such, in 77 the fourth quarter of 2002, the impairment loss was reduced by approximately $33.9 million (after tax and minority interest). The reduction of the impairment was included in net realized investment gains. Concurrent with the sale, several reinsurance agreements under which CCC had provided retrocessional protection to CNA Re U.K. were terminated. As part of the sale, CNA Re U.K.s net exposure to all IGI Program liabilities was assumed by CCC.

Investments in the general account had a total net unrealized gain of $887.0 million at December 31, 2002 compared with $345.0 million at December 31, 2001. The unrealized position at December 31, 2002 was composed of a net unrealized gain of $742.0 million for fixed maturities, a net unrealized gain of $147.0 million for equity securities and a net unrealized loss of $2.0 million for short term securities. The unrealized position at December 31, 2001 was composed of a net unrealized gain of $194.0 million for fixed maturities, a net unrealized gain of $170.0 million for equity securities and a net unrealized loss of $19.0 million for short term securities. Unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity and equity securities are presented in the following tables: Cost or Gross Unrealized Net Amortized Unrealized December 31, 2002 Cost Gains Losses Gain (Loss) (In millions) Fixed maturity securities: U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of government agencies $ 1,266.0 $ 114.0 $ 4.0 $ 110.0 Asset backed securities 7,888.0 336.0 16.0 320.0 States, municipalities and political subdivisions tax exempt 4,966.0 151.0 43.0 108.0 Corporate securities 7,439.0 487.0 335.0 152.0 Other debt securities 3,780.0 284.0 237.0 47.0 Redeemable preferred stock 64.0 5.0 5.0 Options embedded in convertible debt Securities 130.0 Total fixed maturity securities 25,533.0 1,377.0 635.0 742.0 Equity securities: Common stock 310.0 166.0 15.0 151.0 Non redeemable preferred stock 209.0 3.0 7.0 (4.0) Total equity securities 519.0 169.0 22.0 147.0 Total fixed maturity and equity securities $ 26,052.0 $ 1,546.0 $ 657.0 $ 889.0 79 Cost or Gross Unrealized Net Amortized Unrealized December 31, 2001 Cost Gains Losses Gain (Loss) (In millions) Fixed maturity securities: U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of government agencies $ 5,002.0 $ 109.0 $ 30.0 $ 79.0 Asset backed securities 7,603.0 139.0 19.0 120.0 States, municipalities and political subdivisions tax exempt 2,748.0 19.0 47.0 (28.0) Corporate securities 9,569.0 247.0 229.0 18.0 Other debt securities 3,811.0 152.0 147.0 5.0 Redeemable preferred stock 48.0 1.0 1.0 Options embedded in convertible debt securities 189.0 Total fixed maturity securities 28,970.0 667.0 473.0 194.0 Equity securities: Common stock 820.0 326.0 150.0 176.0 Non redeemable preferred stock 348.0 17.0 23.0 (6.0) Total equity securities 1,168.0 343.0 173.0 170.0 Total fixed maturity and equity securities $ 30,138.0 $ 1,010.0 $ 646.0 $ 364.0 CNAs investment policies for both the general and separate accounts emphasize high credit quality and diversification by industry, issuer and issue. Assets supporting interest rate sensitive liabilities are segmented within the general account to facilitate asset/liability duration management. At December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the general account fixed maturities was $26,275.0 million, representing 74.0% of CNAs total investment portfolio. The net unrealized gain of this fixed maturity portfolio was $742.0 million, comprising gross unrealized gains of $1,377.0 million and gross unrealized losses of $635.0 million. The gross unrealized losses were primarily in corporate bonds with the largest industry sectors being Utilities, Communications and Consumer Cyclical, which as a percentage of total gross unrealized losses were 23.0%, 17.0% and 16.0%. Gross unrealized losses in any single issuer did not exceed 0.2% of the carrying value of the total general account fixed maturity portfolio. The following table provides the composition of fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss in relation to the total of all fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss by contractual maturities. Percent of Percent of Unrealized December 31, 2002 Market Value Loss Due in one year or less 2.4% 2.1% Due after one year through five years 18.3 14.0 Due after five years through ten years 28.4 38.6 Due after ten years 45.0 42.8 Asset backed securities 5.9 2.5 Total 100.0% 100.0% 80 The following table summarizes for fixed maturity and equity securities in an unrealized loss position, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. Gross Estimated Unrealized December 31, 2002 Fair Value Loss (In millions) Fixed maturity securities: Investment grade: 0 6 months $ 2,632.0 $ 100.0 7 12 months 361.0 30.0 13 24 months 163.0 21.0 Greater than 24 months 172.0 20.0 Total investment grade 3,328.0 171.0 Non investment grade: 0 6 months 892.0 119.0 7 12 months 473.0 115.0 13 24 months 458.0 157.0 Greater than 24 months 169.0 73.0 Total non investment grade 1,992.0 464.0 Total fixed maturity securities 5,320.0 635.0 Equity securities: 0 6 months 119.0 13.0 7 12 months 79.0 9.0 13 24 months 4.0 Greater than 24 months 4.0 Total equity securities 206.0 22.0 Total fixed maturity and equity securities $ 5,526.0 $ 657.0 CNAs non investment grade fixed maturity securities held as of December 31, 2002 that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of approximately $2.0 billion. As discussed previously, a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary impairment has occurred. CNAs Impairment Committee analyzes securities placed on the watch list on at least a quarterly basis. Part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity of the decline below book value of the watch list securities. The following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized loss of non investment grade securities categorized by the length of time those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and further categorized by the severity of the unrealized loss position in 10.0% increments as of December 31, 2002. Fair Value as a Percentage of Book Value Estimated Unrealized December 31, 2002 Fair Value Loss 90 99% 80 89% 70 79% <70% (In millions) Fixed maturity securities: Non investment grade: 0 6 months $ 892.0 $ 119.0 $ 30.0 $ 28.0 $ 28.0 $ 33.0 7 12 months 473.0 115.0 9.0 12.0 24.0 70.0 13 24 months 458.0 157.0 5.0 12.0 50.0 90.0 Greater than 24 months 169.0 73.0 2.0 6.0 15.0 50.0 Total non investment grade $1,992.0 $ 464.0 $ 46.0 $ 58.0 $ 117.0 $ 243.0 The non investment grade securities that were in an unrealized loss severity of less than 70.0% for longer than six months as of December 31, 2002 primarily consisted of securities in the utilities, communication and transportation 81 sectors representing 35.0%, 21.0% and 17.0% respectively of the gross unrealized loss. The non investment grade securities that were in an unrealized loss severity of less than 70.0% for greater than 24 months as of December 31, 2002 primarily consisted of securities in the communications and transportation sector representing 40.0% and 34.0%, of the gross unrealized loss. Unrealized losses in the communication sector are predominately attributable to a European leader in telecommunication services. The unrealized losses on securities held in the transportation sector are primarily comprised of debt issued from a major domestic airline. As part of the ongoing impairment monitoring process, the Impairment Committee has evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available information for each of these non investment grade securities and determined that no further impairments were necessary at December 31, 2002. This determination was based on a number of factors that the Committee regularly considers including, but not limited to: the issuers ability to meet current and future interest and principal payments, an evaluation of the issuers financial condition and near term prospects, CNAs sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral. In all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary, CNA had the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the market value of such securities or by holding the securities to maturity. In many cases, the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset/liability duration management. As such the Impairment Committee continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity. CNA maintains sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset/liability management process. CNAs equity securities held as of December 31, 2002 that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of $206.0 million. CNAs Impairment Committee, under the same process as fixed maturity securities, monitors the equity securities for other than temporary declines in value. In all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary, CNA expects to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the market value of the security. The general account portfolio consists primarily of high quality (rated BBB or higher) bonds, 89.0% and 92.0% of which are rated as investment grade at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table summarizes the ratings of CNAs general account bond portfolio at carrying value: December 31 2002 2001 (In millions of dollars) U.S. Government and affiliated agency securities $ 1,908.0 7.3% $ 5,715.0 19.6% Other AAA rated 10,856.0 41.4 9,204.0 31.6 AA and A rated 5,730.0 21.9 6,127.0 21.0 BBB rated 4,930.0 18.8 5,583.0 19.2 Non investment grade 2,782.0 10.6 2,487.0 8.6 Total $ 26,206.0 100.0% $ 29,116.0 100.0% At December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately 97% of the general account portfolio was U.S. Government agencies or was rated by S&P or Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys"). The remaining bonds were rated by other rating agencies or CNA management. 82 The following table summarizes the bond ratings of the investments supporting CNAs separate account products, which guarantee principal and a specified rate of interest: December 31 2002 2001 (In millions of dollars) U.S. government and affiliated agency securities $ 161.0 8.6% $ 214.0 10.5% Other AAA rated 898.0 48.1 1,017.0 49.9 AA and A rated 327.0 17.5 310.0 15.2 BBB rated 414.0 22.2 421.0 20.6 Non investment grade 68.0 3.6 77.0 3.8 Total $1,868.0 100.0% $2,039.0 100.0% At December 31, 2002 and 2001, more than 99.0% of the separate account portfolio was U.S. government agencies or was rated by S&P or Moodys. The remaining bonds were rated by other rating agencies or CNA management. Non investment grade bonds, as presented in the tables above, are high yield securities rated below BBB by bond rating agencies, as well as other unrated securities that, in the opinion of management, are below investment grade. High yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade securities. However, expected returns should compensate for the added risk. This risk is also considered in the interest rate assumptions for the underlying insurance products. The carrying value of non traded private placement securities at December 31, 2002 was $237.0 million which represents 0.7% of CNAs total investment portfolio. These securities were in a net unrealized loss position of $0.4 million at December 31, 2002. Of the non traded securities, 78.0% are priced by unrelated third party sources. Included in CNAs general account fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2002 are $8,208.0 million of asset backed securities, at fair value, consisting of approximately 67.0% in collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), 11.0% in corporate asset backed obligations, 7.0% in U.S. Government agency issued pass through certificates and 15.0% in corporate mortgage backed pass through certificates. The majority of CMOs held are actively traded in liquid markets and are priced by broker dealers. The carrying value of the components of the general account short term investment portfolio is presented in the following table: December 31 2002 2001 (In millions) Commercial paper $ 1,141.0 $ 1,194.0 U.S. Treasury securities 2,756.0 175.0 Money market funds 2,161.0 1,641.0 Other 950.0 730.0 Total short term investments $ 7,008.0 $ 3,740.0 CNA invests in certain derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce its exposure to market risk (principally interest rate, equity price and foreign currency risk) and credit risk (risk of nonperformance of underlying obligor). CNA considers the derivatives in its general account to be held for purposes other than trading. Derivative securities are recorded at fair value at the reporting date. Most derivatives in separate accounts are held for hedging purposes. CNA uses these derivatives to mitigate market risk by purchasing S&P 500 index futures in a notional amount equal to the contract liability relating to Life Operations Index 500 guaranteed investment contract product. 83 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 applies to the accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This Statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. Adoption of this Statement is required for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of these provisions will not have a material impact on the equity or results of operations of the Company. In December of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." The Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes the accounting for stock based employee compensation. The statement also amends the disclosure provisions to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based compensation. Finally, this Statement amends Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure of those effects in interim financial information. The disclosure and transition requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The amendment to APB No. 28 is required to be adopted for interim periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has not changed its accounting policies related to stock based compensation. In January of 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. ("FIN") 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51." This Interpretation clarifies the application of ARB No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Prior to the issuance of this Interpretation, ARB No. 51 defined a controlling financial interest as ownership of a majority voting interest. FIN 46 requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity even though the entity does not, either directly or indirectly, own more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares. FIN 46 defines a variable interest entity as having one or both of the following characteristics (1) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or (2) the equity investors lack one or more of the following (a) the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entitys activities through voting rights or similar rights, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, if they occur, which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities and (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, if they occur, which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to interests obtained after that date to an interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact FIN 46 may have on its financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements made or incorporated by reference by the Company in this Report are "forward looking" statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements, and may contain the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. Statements in this report that contain forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding CNAs insurance business relating to asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims, expected cost savings and other results from restructuring activities; statements regarding insurance reserves and statements regarding planned disposition of certain businesses; statements regarding litigation and developments affecting Lorillards tobacco business including, among other things statements regarding claims, litigation and settlement, and statements regarding regulation of the industry; statements regarding Diamond Offshores business including, without limitation, statements with respect to expenditures for rig conversion and upgrade, oil and gas price levels, and exploration and production activity. 84 Such statements inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the impact of competitive products, policies and pricing; product and policy availability and demand and market responses, including the effect of the absence of applicable terrorism legislation on coverages; development of claims and the effect on loss reserves; exposure to liabilities due to claims made by insured and others relating to asbestos remediation and health based asbestos impairments, and exposure to liabilities for environmental pollution and mass tort claims; the sufficiency of CNAs loss reserves and the possibility of future increases in reserves; the performance of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts; the effects of corporate bankruptcies and or accounting restatements (such as Enron and WorldCom) on the financial markets, and the resulting decline in value of securities held by the Company which may result in additional charges for impairment; the effects of corporate bankruptcies and or accounting restatements on the markets for directors and officers and errors and omissions coverages; limitations upon CNAs ability to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries imposed by state regulatory agencies; regulatory limitations and restrictions upon CNA and its insurance subsidiaries generally; judicial decisions and rulings; the possibility of downgrades in CNAs ratings by ratings agencies and changes in rating agency policies and practices, and the results of financing efforts. The tobacco industry continues to be subject to health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, legislation, including actual and potential excise tax increases, increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions, governmental regulation, privately imposed smoking restrictions, litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the general understandings of applicable law, bonding requirements and the absence of adequate appellate remedies to get timely relief from any of the foregoing, and the effects of price increases related to concluded tobacco litigation settlements and excise tax increases on consumption rates. In addition to the factors noted above, all aspects of the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are affected by the impact of general economic and business conditions, changes in financial markets (interest rate, credit, currency, commodities and equities) or in the value of specific investments; changes in domestic and foreign political, social and economic conditions, the economic effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the impact of judicial rulings and jury verdicts, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations and various other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company and its subsidiaries. Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully described elsewhere in this Report could cause the Companys results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected by or on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in the Companys expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based. 85 SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following supplemental condensed financial information reflects the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Loews Corporation with its investments in CNA and Diamond Offshore accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. It does not purport to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries." Management believes, however, that this disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial statements by providing users with a format that management uses in assessing the Company.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is a large diversified financial services company. As such, it and its subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk. The Companys measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio would be recognized as investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the Company at December 31, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. The Company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since the Companys investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the Company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it. The Company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Equity Price Risk The Company has exposure to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. Equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous 25% change in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, 2002 and 2001, with all other variables held constant. Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and forwards. The Company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the Companys investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the Company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the Companys interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2002 and 2001 due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the Companys earnings or shareholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The Companys long term debt, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 is denominated in U.S. Dollars. The Companys debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $374.6 and $395.0 million, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $440.1 and $464.6 million, respectively. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. The Company has foreign exchange rate exposure when it buys or sells foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency. This exposure is mitigated by the Companys asset/liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched. The Companys foreign transactions are primarily denominated in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and the 89 European Monetary Unit. The sensitivity analysis also assumes an instantaneous 20% change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar from their levels at December 31, 2002 and 2001, with all other variables held constant. Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk as a result of its investments in gold options. Commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change of 20% from their levels at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The following tables present the Companys market risk by category (equity markets, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes. Trading portfolio: Category of risk exposure: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31 2002 2001 2002 2001 (Amounts in millions) Equity markets (1): Equity securities $ 430.7 $ 290.0 $ (108.0) $ (73.0) Options purchased 23.7 17.5 3.0 6.0 written (19.2) (7.8) 2.0 (3.0) Index futures long (2.0) Short sales (200.7) (193.4) 50.0 48.0 Separate accounts Equity securities (a) 6.3 11.7 (2.0) (2.0) Other invested assets 326.5 342.1 (5.0) (6.0) Interest rate (2): Options on government securities short (2.5) (2.0) Interest rate swaps (7.1) (31.0) Separate accounts Fixed maturities 145.4 308.4 3.0 (5.0) Short term investments 166.6 296.0 Gold (3): Options purchased 0.6 2.6 14.0 (3.0) written (0.7) (0.4) (20.0) Note: The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease in equity prices of 25%, (2) a decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2002 and an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2001 and (3) a decrease in gold prices of 20% at December 31, 2002 and an increase in gold prices of 20% at December 31, 2001. Adverse changes on options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk exposure. (a) In addition, the Separate Accounts carry positions in equity index futures. A decrease in equity prices of 25% would result in market risk amounting to $(151.0) and $(217.0) million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This market risk would be offset by decreases in liabilities to customers under variable insurance contracts. 90 Other than trading portfolio: Category of risk exposure: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31 2002 2001 2002 2001 (Amounts in millions) Equity markets (1): Equity securities: General accounts (a) $ 666.1 $ 1,338.5 $ (166.0) $ (322.0) Separate accounts 112.0 148.6 (28.0) (37.0) Other invested assets 1,157.6 1,306.9 (133.0) (134.0) Separate accounts Other invested assets 387.3 533.0 (97.0) (133.0) Interest rate (2): Fixed maturities (a) (b) 27,433.7 31,191.0 (1,650.0) (1,560.0) Short term investments (a) 10,161.7 6,734.8 (6.0) (1.0) Other invested assets 263.0 258.5 Other derivative securities 18.0 16.3 (47.0) (19.0) Separate accounts (a): Fixed maturities 1,868.1 2,038.8 (96.0) (120.0) Short term investments 109.5 98.0 Long term debt (5,558.0) (5,399.0) Note: The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease in equity prices of 25% and (2) an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points. (a) Certain securities are denominated in foreign currencies. An assumed 20% decline in the underlying exchange rates would result in an aggregate foreign currency exchange rate risk of $(148.0), and $(114.0) million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (b) Certain fixed maturities positions include options embedded in convertible debt securities. A decrease in underlying equity prices of 25% would result in market risk amounting to $(24.0) and $(50.0) million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 91
