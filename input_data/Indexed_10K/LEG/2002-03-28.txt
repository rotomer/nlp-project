Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Capital Resources and Liquidity The Companys financial position reflects managements capital policy guidelines. These guidelines are intended to ensure that corporate liquidity is adequate to support the Companys projected growth rate and to finance the Companys ongoing operations in periods of economic downturn. In a normal operating environment, management intends to direct capital to ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions and other investments that provide opportunities for expansion and enhanced profitability. Our policy is to expand capital resources debt and equity at appropriate times to allow the Company to take advantage of favorable capital market conditions, rather than respond to short term needs. Such financial flexibility is considered more important than short term maximization of earnings per share through excessive leverage. Therefore, management continuously provides for available credit in excess of near term projected cash needs and has maintained a guideline for long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization in a range of 30% to 40%. Total Capitalization The following table shows the Companys total capitalization at the end of the three most recent years. Also, the table shows the amount of unused committed credit available through the Companys revolving bank credit agreements, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges at the end of the three most recent years. 2001 2000 1999 (Dollar amounts in millions) Long term debt outstanding: Scheduled maturities.................... $ 977.6 $ 988.4 $ 642.7 Average interest rates.............. 4.8% 6.8% 6.7% Average maturities in years......... 4.0 4.8 5.5 Revolving credit/commercial paper....... 144.7 Total long term debt............. 977.6 988.4 787.4 Deferred income taxes and other liabilities 111.7 114.4 112.4 Shareholders equity....................... 1,866.6 1,793.8 1,646.2 Total capitalization............. $2,955.9 $2,896.6 $2,546.0 Unused committed credit: Long term............................... $ 232.5 $ 215.0 $ 52.8 Short term.............................. 110.0 112.5 97.5 Total unused committed credit.............. $ 342.5 $ 327.5 $ 150.3 Cash and cash equivalents.................. $ 187.2 $ 37.3 $ 20.6 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges......... 5.2x 6.4x 9.8x Cash provided by operating activities was $534.5 million, $440.8 million and $370.8 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, or a three year total of $1,346.1 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2001 compared to the prior year principally reflects a decline in working capital (excluding acquisitions), partially offset by lower earnings and deferred tax benefits. The decline in working capital in 2001 results from both a slower business environment and a concentrated effort by management to decrease working capital levels. The significant cash provided in 2001 by lower working capital levels is not expected to recur in future years, particularly as business conditions improve. However, management will continue to focus on improving efficiency in the use of working capital. In 2000, cash provided by operating activities exceeded prior 8 year levels due to an increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), a reduction in current tax expense and a smaller increase in working capital (excluding acquisitions), partially offset by higher interest costs. Long term debt was 33.1%, 34.1% and 30.9% of total capitalization at the end of 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Long term debt as a percent of total capitalization, net of cash, was 28.5%, 33.3% and 30.4% at the end of 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As shown in the preceding table, obligations having scheduled maturities are the primary source of the Companys debt capital. At the end of 2001, these obligations consisted primarily of the Companys medium term notes. Due to implementation of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, long term debt increased $38.1 million from year end 2000. That increase was more than offset by the maturity of $50 million in medium term notes in June 2001. In February 2000, $350 million of 7.65% five year notes were issued under a $500 million shelf registration completed in November 1999. These notes were converted to variable rate notes under an interest rate swap agreement. The proceeds of the offering were used to pay down commercial paper and to fund the Companys capital expenditures and acquisition activity. In the second and third quarters of 1999, the Company issued a total of $104 million in medium term notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay maturing notes and for acquisitions. The secondary source of the Companys debt capital consists of revolving bank credit agreements and commercial paper issuances. Management has negotiated bank credit agreements and established a commercial paper program to continuously support the Companys projected growth and to maintain highly flexible sources of debt capital. The majority of the credit under these arrangements is a long term obligation. If needed, however, the credit is available for short term borrowings and repayments. To further facilitate the issuance of debt capital, the Company has in effect a $500 million shelf registration of debt. The Company has had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of the last two years. Additional details of long term debt, including scheduled maturities, revolving credit and commercial paper are discussed in Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not extensively use off balance sheet financing, but has entered into synthetic leases in the amount of $35.1 million in 2001, and has a limited amount of other long term noncancelable operating leases as discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These leasing transactions provide economic benefits to the Company versus outright purchase of the related assets. In 2001, the synthetic leases provided $35.1 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the assets to the lessor, which are included in other cash provided by investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company relies on cash flow from operations as its primary source of capital. The weak economic conditions that began in the last half of 2000 and continued through 2001 would have normally resulted in reduced cash flow. The Company responded to these difficult business conditions by decreasing capital spending, temporarily reducing the pace of acquisitions, and lowering working capital. As a result of these improvements, the Company achieved strong growth in cash flow and was able to increase cash and equivalents to a level that provides adequate liquidity to finance ongoing operations and fund a portion of future growth initiatives. Any future working capital reductions will likely not be as large as in 2001. The Company has sufficient unused committed credit to ensure that future capital resources are sufficient for its ongoing operations and growth opportunities. Due to the recession in the United States and some weakness in certain of the Companys businesses that preceded the recession, the Companys earnings and profit margins have decreased in both 2001 and 2000. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges and other financial ratios have also shown a decline over these two difficult years. The Companys senior debt currently carries a Moodys rating of A2 and a Standard & Poors rating of A+. If the Companys debt ratings were lowered as a result of the decline in financial ratios, management believes that any such change would be temporary due to current economic conditions, but would not have a significant impact on the Companys ability to raise capital. 9 Uses of Capital Resources The Companys internal investments to modernize and expand manufacturing capacity totaled $456.8 million in the last three years. In 2002, management anticipates internal investments will approximate the $128.0 million spent in 2001. During the last three years, the Company employed $637.5 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and issued 1.6 million shares or equivalents of common stock in acquisitions. During 2001, ten businesses were acquired for $95.1 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and 61,026 shares or share equivalents. In addition, the Company assumed $21.0 million of acquisition companies debt and other liabilities. Of the ten 2001 acquisitions, three were made in Residential Furnishings, five in Commercial Furnishings, one in Industrial Materials and one in Specialized Products. Additional details of acquisitions are discussed in Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additions, by segment, to property, plant and equipment and purchases of long lived assets are shown in Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Company purchases of its common stock (net of issuances) totaled $51.3 million in 2001, $49.2 million in 2000, and $77.5 million in 1999. These purchases were made primarily for employee stock plans, to replace shares issued in purchase acquisitions and to satisfy contractual obligations. The Board of Directors annually authorizes management, at its discretion, to buy up to 2,000,000 shares of Leggett stock for use in employee benefit plans. This authorization is continuously replenished as shares acquired are reissued for these benefit plans. In addition, management is authorized, again at its discretion, to repurchase any shares issued in acquisitions. At the end of the third quarter 2000, the Board of Directors authorized management to buy up to an additional 10,000,000 shares of Leggett stock as part of the Companys performance improvement plan also announced at that time. No specific schedule of purchases has been established under this authorization, which expires in August 2002. The amount and timing of any purchases will depend on availability of cash, economic and market conditions, acquisition activity and other factors. Cash dividends paid on the Companys common stock in the last three years totaled $240.2 million. Over this three year period, cash dividends per share have increased at a 15.1% compounded annual rate. As a percent of earnings per share (diluted), cash dividends per share were 51.1% in 2001, 31.8% in 2000 and 24.8% in 1999. The Companys guideline for dividend payout is approximately 33% of the prior three years average earnings. The following table summarizes the Companys future contractual obligations and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 2 3 4 5 After 5 Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years Years Long term debt *............................. $ 945.3 $ 5.8 $321.1 $453.3 $165.1 Operating leases............................. 109.7 35.0 46.4 20.5 7.8 Residual value of guaranteed synthetic leases 18.8 18.8 Other long term obligations.................. 47.0 15.3 6.4 25.3 Total contractual cash obligations........... $1,120.8 $40.8 $382.8 $499.0 $198.2 *Excluding $38.1 million of fair market value from interest rate swap agreements. The long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if the Company was unable to meet its principal and interest payments when due. The Company believes it has sufficient capital resources to satisfy these obligations. Short term Liquidity At the end of 2001, working capital, excluding cash and acquisitions decreased $181.6 million from 2000 levels. The improvement is primarily related to an $84.6 million reduction in receivables, as DSO (days sales 10 outstanding) fell to its lowest level in two years. Inventories were also down $84.7 million from year end 2000, the result of slow economic conditions and the Companys efforts to reduce working capital. The majority of the reduction in working capital levels was accomplished during the last half of 2001. Accordingly, as a percent of fourth quarter annualized sales, working capital (excluding cash) at year end was down to 20.1%, versus 22.1% one year earlier. Working capital, excluding cash and acquisitions, increased $30.8 million and $96.1 million for the years 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the last half of 2000, the Company began concentrating on reducing working capital levels. Due to the softening in market demand discussed below under "Results of Operations", the desired reduction in inventory had not yet been achieved at year end. The increase in working capital during 1999 was due in large part to increased same location sales volume, with some inventory build up at the end of 1999 due to anticipation of higher prices for certain key raw materials. The following table shows the annual turnover on average year end working capital, trade receivables and inventories. The ratios may be affected by timing of the Companys acquisitions. 2001 2000 1999 Working capital turnover (excluding cash and cash equivalents) 4.9x 5.0x 5.2x Trade receivables turnover.................................... 6.8 7.2 7.3 Inventory turnover............................................ 4.9 5.0 5.1 Receivables turnover in the Aluminum Products segment is lower than in the other segments due principally to the seasonal nature of its gas barbecue grill business. Also, aluminum commitments to certain customers result in carrying higher levels of inventory than the Companys other segments. Recent acquisitions concentrated in the Commercial Furnishings and Specialized Products segments also contributed to reductions in working capital turnover and inventory turnover due to increased production time and extended delivery schedules in these businesses. Results of Operations Discussion of Consolidated Results In 2001, sales were $4.11 billion, a decrease of 3.8% versus the record sales of $4.28 billion set in 2000, declining for just the second time in the Companys 34 year history as a public company. Sales growth from acquisitions was more than offset by a 9.3% decline in same location sales, as decreased unit volumes from weak market demand continued to negatively impact all five business segments. Earnings, at $.94 per diluted share, were down $.38, or 29%, from last years $1.32. During 2000 and 1999, sales increased 13.2% and 12.1%, respectively, while same location sales increased .2% and 2.9% for the same periods. Same location sales growth primarily reflected increases in unit volumes. Internal growth during 2000 was negatively impacted by reduced market demand across all segments, particularly in the last half of the year. Selling prices in 2000 for certain products include some recovery of higher raw material costs. Trends in the general economy were very favorable during 1999, which had a positive impact on unit volume, although 1999 was also impacted by lower selling prices for certain products. The following table shows various measures of earnings as a percentage of sales for the last three years. It also shows the effective income tax rate. 2001 2000 1999 Gross profit margin............................. 24.1% 25.4% 27.0% EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin 8.5 11.2 13.3 Net profit margin............................... 4.6 6.2 7.7 Effective income tax rate....................... 36.9 36.9 37.2 11 The declines in 2001 and 2000 primarily reflect weakened demand in all of the Companys business segments, as well as lower than expected performance in the Companys Aluminum Products and Commercial Furnishings segments and some parts of the Residential Furnishings segment. Production cutbacks, plant restructuring and closure costs, reduced plant utilization and resulting lower overhead absorption significantly impacted profit and EBIT margins. Plant utilization in 2001 was further reduced due to the Companys efforts to reduce inventory levels. Margins were also reduced in 2001 by higher bad debt expense and workers compensation costs. Increased medical expenses and higher energy costs in both years contributed to lower margins. Lower incentive compensation costs in both years, cost structure improvements and reduced overheads as a result of the Companys tactical plan announced in September 2000 helped offset these increasing costs. Interest expense was lower in 2001 versus 2000, partially offsetting the decline in net margin. Higher interest expense during 2000 contributed to the decline in net margin versus 1999. The lower effective income tax rate in 2000 (the same effective rate for 2001) primarily reflects a reduction in foreign statutory rates compared to 1999. The Company is making steady progress on its tactical plan, aimed at improving performance, margins and shareholder return. Through December 2001, the Company has consolidated or sold 20 facilities; restructured other operations; reduced full time equivalent headcount by approximately 3,700 (excluding acquisitions); conserved cash by reducing capital and acquisition spending; and repurchased 4.9 million shares (primarily to offset shares issued in employee programs). The Company expects to continue this tactical course for as long as conditions warrant. Once economic conditions and performance improve, subject to management discretion, the Company expects to return to its traditional level of acquisition activity. The Companys strategic, long term growth plans remain unchanged. The increase in gross profit margin in 1999 reflected several favorable factors. These included continued increases in production efficiencies, increased sales of products with above average margins, lower material costs and better manufacturing overhead absorption. The EBIT margin also increased due to these factors, offset somewhat by higher operating costs as a percentage of sales. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, which include some amount of fixed administrative and other costs, were higher because of lower selling prices in certain product lines and higher operating costs in acquired companies. Discussion of Segment Results A description of the products included in each segment, segment sales, segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and other segment data appear in Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Following is a comparison of EBIT margins (Segment EBIT divided by Total Segment Sales): 2001 2000 1999 Residential Furnishings 8.6% 10.5% 11.2% Commercial Furnishings. 5.6 11.2 16.3 Aluminum Products...... 5.5 6.7 9.6 Industrial Materials... 10.6 13.7 14.2 Specialized Products... 10.1 12.5 12.1 Residential Furnishings sales decreased 3.8% during 2001. Same location sales, which were partially offset by acquisitions, decreased 5.9%. EBIT declined $47.5 million, or 21.2%, as soft industry demand and inventory reduction efforts resulted in lower production. The lower plant utilization reduced overhead absorption, yielding lower margins. Also negatively impacting EBIT during 2001 were restructuring charges of $6.5 million. For 2000, Residential Furnishings sales increased 9.2%, with same location growth of 2.4%. Numerous acquisitions accounted for the balance of the growth. EBIT increased 2.0%, with strong volume and efficiency gains in the first half of the year offset by softening industry demand, efforts to reduce finished goods inventory which resulted in lower production, and reduced overhead absorption and efficiency starting in the third quarter. Commercial Furnishings sales decreased 3.5% during 2001, while same location sales, which were partially offset by acquisitions, declined 11.7%. EBIT decreased $56.1 million, or 51.4%, due primarily to lower same 12 location sales and reduced margins, reflecting poor business conditions in the office and contract furniture markets, continued market weakness and reduced fixture purchases in telecom and utility van industries, and plant inefficiencies. Restructuring charges of $8.9 million also negatively impacted EBIT. In 2000, Commercial Furnishings sales increased 26.7% due to numerous acquisitions, with same location sales down 3.0%, as some customers for store fixture, display, and storage products reduced purchases. EBIT declined 13.5% in 2000 due to demand shortfalls, reduced margins attributable to the changing mix of businesses, plant inefficiencies and a supplier disruption at a store fixture and design firm acquired in 1999. Plant restructuring costs also had a negative impact on EBIT margins. Aluminum Products sales decreased 15.7% in 2001. Same location sales were down 17.2%, and were slightly offset by one acquisition. Reduced die cast component sales reflect weak market demand in a variety of consumer and industrial sectors including telecom, electrical, diesel engine and barbecue grill markets. EBIT decreased $11.1 million, or 30.4%. The EBIT decrease resulting from declining sales was partially offset by reduced overhead and absence of last years restructuring costs. In 2000, Aluminum Products sales decreased .5%. Same location sales declined 1.6%, and were partially offset by one acquisition. Starting in the second quarter, reduced die cast component sales reflected weak market demand for a variety of consumer and industrial products, including castings for barbecue grills, diesel truck engine components, small gasoline engines, outdoor lighting and electrical products. EBIT decreased 30.6%, reflecting significantly reduced production in the second half of the year, plant underutilization, higher natural gas costs, smelting losses, and plant closure costs. Industrial Materials sales decreased 2.5% in 2001. Same location sales were down 9.9%, and were partially offset by acquisitions. EBIT decreased $18.1 million, or 24.5%, primarily as a result of reduced sales volumes and lower plant utilization. During 2000, Industrial Materials sales increased 8.6%, with same location growth of 2.5%. Acquisitions accounted for the balance of the sales growth. EBIT improved 4.4% in 2000, however, EBIT margins were down reflecting higher raw materials costs, primarily for steel rod and flat rolled steel used to make wire and welded steel tubing, and production inefficiencies. Specialized Products sales increased 13.3% during 2001 due to acquisitions, partially offset by a 3.2% decline in same location sales. EBIT decreased $4 million, or 8.6%, due primarily to slowing production and reduced demand in automotive markets and the machinery group, along with changing product mix. In 2000, Specialized Products sales increased 32.2% due to acquisitions. Same location sales declined .3%. EBIT increased 36.1%, reflecting acquisitions, increased sales of specialized machinery with higher margins, and improved efficiencies. Seasonality The percent of consolidated net sales by quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions, is as follows for the last three years: 2001 2000 1999 First Quarter. 24.9% 24.7% 23.9% Second Quarter 24.9 25.4 25.6 Third Quarter. 26.4 26.1 25.7 Fourth Quarter 23.8 23.8 24.8 Year.......... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% The Company does not experience significant seasonality, however, as indicated in the above table, quarter to quarter sales can vary in proportion to the total year by up to 3%. The timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of the Companys businesses. In 2001 and 2000, the economic slowdown impacted the Companys various businesses and "normal" seasonality was likely distorted somewhat in these years. Nevertheless, for the Companys businesses in total, the second and third 13 quarters have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower. This small seasonality has become somewhat more pronounced, with the third quarter higher and the fourth quarter showing lower proportionate sales due to the growth of the store fixtures business of Commercial Furnishings. Residential Furnishings and Commercial Furnishings typically have their strongest sales in the second and third quarters. Commercial Furnishings particularly has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixtures products, with the first and fourth quarters generally lower. Aluminum Products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to gas barbecue grill castings. Industrial Materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from wire products used for baling cotton. Specialized Products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the first two quarters of the year, and somewhat lower in the third quarter, due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer. Major Accounting Policies, Estimates and Other Factors Influencing Financial Reporting As more fully disclosed in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has adopted numerous accounting policies from among acceptable alternatives, and management must make many critical estimates or assumptions when preparing financial statements. The most critical estimates and assumptions impacting the ongoing operations are as follows: credit losses; costs related to workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property and medical programs; and inventory losses from obsolescence. With respect to credit losses, the Companys customers are diverse, but many are small to medium size companies and some are highly leveraged. Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning, particularly in the current difficult economic environment, adding to the difficulty in estimating credit losses. Workers compensation and other program costs may require a long period after the actual loss occurred before the exact amount of the cost is known. Estimates of these costs over that period, which in some cases is several years, will vary from the final amount. The Company carries insurance for individual losses that exceed a certain amount specified for each program. Changing customer specifications, technology, customer bankruptcy and other factors result in inventory losses that are difficult to estimate precisely. At any financial statement date, the impact of these factors on inventory value may not be completely known. The Companys accounting estimates of these costs and losses are based on available actuarial estimates, prior experience and close monitoring of each loss exposure. The most significant estimates, other than for ongoing operations, are for exposure to unusual litigation and claims and for the impact of plant restructurings and closings. Accounting periods are impacted by these losses when specific facts are known which affect the loss estimate. The Company has not recorded any significant losses for litigation and claims for 2001 1999, and management is not aware of any significant unrecorded exposures. The Company records restructuring or plant closing losses generally when specific implementation actions have been approved. No significant income is reflected in the 2001 1999 financial statements for the reversal of restructuring or plant closing losses accrued in a prior period. Other factors influencing the integrity of financial reporting have been widely discussed in recent months in the financial press. Management does not believe that the Companys financial statements are materially impacted by such factors. For example, only approximately 2% of the Companys sales are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on other than product shipment. The majority of the sales recorded for unshipped items are based on the "percentage of completion" method due to the project nature of the item. As discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has a synthetic lease agreement. The synthetic lease involved a $35.1 million "sale and leaseback" of aircraft and machinery, and no gain was recorded on the sale of the assets to the lessor. This synthetic lease arrangement provides access to the lessors lower borrowing costs. Had the Company not entered into the synthetic lease, an additional $35.1 14 million of equipment (+3.7% of consolidated net property, plant and equipment) and debt (+3.6% of consolidated long term debt) would have been included on the Companys balance sheet. The Company uses few derivatives, except for the interest rate swaps discussed in Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As required by FASB Statement No. 133, the interest rate swaps, and related debt, are recorded at market value in the balance sheet. New Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in 2001. Statement No. 142 requires, among other things, that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be tested periodically for impairment. The amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of Statement No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The goodwill amortization change will contribute ten cents per share to 2002 annual earnings. During 2002, the Company will undertake the computation of the implied fair value of goodwill for its reporting units to test if such implied fair value is less than the carrying value of goodwill, and to identify potential goodwill impairment. The Company cannot estimate at this time the results of the Statement No. 142 goodwill impairment test. During August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal by sale of long lived assets. The provisions of this Statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. This Statement may impact the accounting and reporting for any future restructuring or closing of facilities, but such impact cannot be estimated. Forward Looking Statements This report and other public reports or statements made from time to time by the Company or its management may contain "forward looking" statements concerning possible future events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Such statements are identified either by the context in which they appear or by use of words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," or the like. Readers are cautioned that any forward looking statement reflects only the beliefs of the Company or its management at the time the statement is made. In addition, readers should keep in mind that, because all forward looking statements deal with the future, they are subject to risks, uncertainties and developments which might cause actual events or results to differ materially from those envisioned or reflected in any forward looking statement. Moreover, the Company does not have and does not undertake any duty to update or revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement was made. For all of these reasons, forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. It is not possible to anticipate and list all of the risks, uncertainties and developments which may affect the future operations or performance of the Company, or which otherwise may cause actual events or results to differ from forward looking statements. However, some of these risks and uncertainties include the following: the Companys ability to improve operations and realize cost savings, future growth of acquired companies, competitive and general economic and market conditions and risks, such as the rate of economic growth in the United States, inflation, government regulation, interest rates, taxation, and the like; risks and uncertainties which could affect industries or markets in which the Company participates, such as growth rates and opportunities in those industries, or changes in demand for certain products, etc.; and factors which could impact costs, including but not limited to the availability and pricing of raw materials, the availability of labor and wage rates, and fuel and energy costs. 15 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. (Unaudited) (Dollar amounts in millions) Interest Rate The table below provides information about the Companys debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Company has no other significant financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Company has not typically in the past used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. However, during 2000, $350 of 7.65% fixed rate debt maturing in February 2005 and, in 1999, $14 of 6.90% fixed rate debt maturing in June 2004 were issued and converted to variable rate debt by use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements, which contain the same payment dates as the original issues, are used primarily by the Company to manage the fixed/variable interest rate mix of its debt portfolio, and are included as variable rate debt in the table below. Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars (U.S. $). The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by $13.8 at December 31, 2001, and was not significantly different from its carrying value at December 31, 2000. The fair value of the fixed rate debt was calculated using the U.S. Treasury Bond rate as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated "spread" over such Treasury securities representing the Companys interest costs under its medium term note program. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

Exchange Rate The Company has not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in other than its functional currencies, although such transactions have not been material in the past.
