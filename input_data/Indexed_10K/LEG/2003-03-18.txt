Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys financial position reflects managements capital policy guidelines. These guidelines are intended to ensure that corporate liquidity is adequate to support the Companys projected growth rate and to finance the Companys ongoing operations in periods of economic downturn. In a normal operating environment, management intends to direct capital to ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions and other investments that provide opportunities for expansion and enhanced profitability. Our policy is to expand capital resources debt and equity at appropriate times to allow the Company to take advantage of favorable capital market conditions, rather than respond to short term needs. We consider financial flexibility more important than short term maximization of earnings per share through excessive leverage. Therefore, management continuously provides for available credit in excess of near term projected cash needs and has maintained a guideline for long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization in a range of 30% to 40%. Short term Liquidity The Company relies on cash flow from operations as its primary source of capital. Cash provided by operating activities was $455.9 million, $534.5 million and $440.8 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, or a three year total of over $1.43 billion. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2002, compared to the prior year, principally reflects a slowing of working capital decreases, partially offset by higher earnings. Cash from operations during 2001 increased over the prior year due to a reduction of working capital, partially offset by lower earnings. Working capital, excluding cash and current maturities of long term debt, was 18.6% of annual sales in 2002. This is the lowest year end level of working capital in seven years, and below the Companys target of 19% for working capital as a percent of sales. Working capital, excluding cash and current maturities of long term debt, was 19.0% and 21.0% of annual sales for the years 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decline in working capital in 2001 resulted from both a slower business environment and a concentrated effort (beginning during the last half of 2000) by management to decrease working capital levels. The following table shows the annual turnover on average year end working capital, trade receivables and inventories. The ratios may be affected by timing of the Companys acquisitions. 2002 2001 2000 Working capital turnover (excluding cash and cash equivalents and current debt) 5.4 x 4.9 x 5.0 x Trade receivables turnover 7.5 6.8 7.2 Inventory turnover 5.6 5.2 5.3 Receivables turnover in the Aluminum Products segment is lower than in the other segments due principally to the seasonal nature of its gas barbecue grill business and industry practices regarding credit terms. The Commercial Fixturing & Components segment has lower inventory turnover than other segments due to increased production time and extended delivery schedules in their business. The weak economic conditions that began in the last half of 2000 and continued through 2002 would have normally resulted in reduced cash flow. The Company responded to these difficult business conditions by reducing costs through consolidation or sale of facilities, the restructure of other operations, the reduction of overhead, and the reduction of full time equivalent employment. In addition, the Company has reduced capital spending, brought working capital as a percent of annualized sales to the lowest level in seven years and temporarily reduced the pace of acquisitions. Through these steps, the Company has improved operational performance, profit margins and return on shareholders equity. Also, as a result of these improvements, the Company has achieved strong growth in cash flow to provide adequate liquidity to finance ongoing operations, repurchase nine million shares of stock, pay down debt and fund a portion of future growth initiatives. While 11 Table of Contents future economic conditions are uncertain, the Company should continue to generate significant cash flow from operations even though additional working capital reductions will be more difficult to achieve. The Company also has sufficient unused committed credit to ensure that future capital resources are adequate for its ongoing operations and growth opportunities. Total Capitalization The following table shows the Companys total capitalization at the end of the three most recent years. Also, the table shows the amount of unused committed credit available through the Companys revolving bank credit agreements, current maturities of long term debt, the amount of cash and cash equivalents, and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges at the end of the three most recent years. 2002 2001 2000 (Dollar amounts in millions) Long term debt outstanding: Scheduled maturities $ 808.6 $ 977.6 $ 988.4 Average interest rates 4.3 % 4.8 % 6.8 % Average maturities in years 3.4 4.0 4.8 Revolving credit/commercial paper Total long term debt 808.6 977.6 988.4 Deferred income taxes and other liabilities 117.6 111.7 114.4 Shareholders equity 1,976.9 1,866.6 1,793.8 Total capitalization $ 2,903.1 $ 2,955.9 $ 2,896.6 Unused committed credit: Long term $ 233.0 $ 232.5 $ 215.0 Short term 106.5 110.0 112.5 Total unused committed credit $ 339.5 $ 342.5 $ 327.5 Current maturities of long term debt $ 127.7 $ 5.8 $ 5.9 Cash and cash equivalents $ 225.0 $ 187.2 $ 37.3 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 7.6 x 5.2 x 6.4 x Long term debt was 27.9%, 33.1% and 34.1% of total capitalization at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Long term debt as a percent of total capitalization, net of cash and current maturities, was 25.4%, 28.7% and 33.4% at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Long term debt decreased $169.0 million from year end 2001, primarily due to a reclass of $124.4 million in long term debt to current maturities and the maturity and payment of $75 million in medium term notes. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $10.7 million in fair market value related to the Companys interest rate swap agreements. Also, during 2002 the Company capitalized certain leases that were previously accounted for as operating leases under synthetic lease arrangements entered into during the last half of 2001. During 2002, certain changes were made to these leases and the Company elected early implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46, resulting in the recording of these arrangements as capitalized leases in 2002. Accordingly, property, plant and equipment and long term debt increased by $30.5 million as a result of this change. These leases provide economic benefits to the Company versus outright purchase of the related assets. During 2002, $124.4 million was reclassified from long term debt to current maturities. Until recently, the Company had intended to refinance all current maturities of medium term notes and commercial paper on a long term basis. With the Companys current strong cash position, current maturities will likely be paid and not replaced until the need for additional debt arises. As shown in the preceding table, obligations having scheduled maturities are the current source of the Companys debt capital. At the end of 2002, these obligations consisted primarily of the Companys medium 12 Table of Contents term notes and tax exempt industrial development bonds. The Companys senior debt currently carries a Moodys rating of A2 and a Standard & Poors rating of A+. In February 2000, $350 million of 7.65% five year notes were issued under a $500 million shelf registration completed in November 1999. These notes were converted to variable rate notes under an interest rate swap agreement. The proceeds of the offering were used to pay down commercial paper and to fund the Companys capital expenditures and acquisition activity. In March 2003, the Company sold its rights under this interest rate swap agreement for $40 million. The secondary source of the Companys debt capital consists of revolving bank credit agreements and commercial paper issuances. Management has negotiated bank credit agreements and established a commercial paper program to continuously support the Companys projected growth and to maintain highly flexible sources of debt capital. The majority of the credit under these arrangements is a long term obligation. If needed, however, the credit is available for short term borrowings and repayments. To further facilitate the issuance of debt capital, the Company has in effect a $500 million shelf registration of debt. The Company has had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of the last three years. Additional details of long term debt, including scheduled maturities, revolving credit and commercial paper are discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Uses of Capital Resources The Companys internal investments to modernize and expand manufacturing capacity totaled $421.7 million in the last three years. In 2003, management anticipates internal investments will range from approximately $125 to $150 million. During the last three years, the Company employed $393.0 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and issued .3 million shares or equivalents of common stock in acquisitions. During 2002, seven businesses were acquired for $45.6 million in cash (net of cash acquired). In addition, the Company assumed $2.5 million of acquisition companies debt and other liabilities. Of the seven 2002 acquisitions, which should add about $70 million to annual revenue, two were made in Residential Furnishings, one in Commercial Fixturing & Components, one in Aluminum Products, two in Industrial Materials and one in Specialized Products. Additional details of acquisitions are discussed in Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2002, the Company also acquired the rod mill and related assets of a bankrupt steel company, which purchase is included in expenditures for property, plant and equipment. These assets are being refurbished to provide steel rod for the Industrial Materials segment. Additions, by segment, to property, plant and equipment and purchases of long lived assets are shown in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Company purchases of its common stock (net of issuances) totaled $80.5 million in 2002, $51.3 million in 2001, and $49.2 million in 2000. These purchases were made primarily for employee stock plans. The Board of Directors annually authorizes management, at its discretion, to buy up to two million shares of Leggett stock for use in employee benefit plans or for other purposes. This authorization is continuously replenished as shares acquired are reissued for benefit plans. In addition, management is authorized, again at its discretion, to repurchase any shares issued in acquisitions. At the end of the third quarter 2000, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of Leggett stock. In August 2002, the Board of Directors continued this authorization for an additional period expiring in September 2003. As of December 31, 2002 the Company had acquired approximately .4 million shares under such authorization. No specific schedule of purchases has been established under this authorization. The amount and timing of purchases will depend on availability of cash, economic and market conditions, acquisition activity and other factors. Cash dividends on the Companys common stock in the last three years totaled $267.4 million. Over this three year period, cash dividends per share have increased at an 11.6% compounded annual rate. The Companys guideline for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three years average earnings. As a percent of the prior three year average earnings, cash dividends per share were 43.7% in 2002, 38.8% in 2001 and 31.4% in 2000. As earnings recover, the Company expects to move back toward its 3035% dividend payout target. 13 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Companys future contractual obligations and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 23 Years 45 Years After 5 Years Long term debt* $ 887.5 $ 127.7 $ 511.4 $ 106.3 $ 142.1 Operating leases 90.4 28.7 36.2 17.1 8.4 Other long term obligations 38.2 12.2 4.5 21.5 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,016.1 $ 156.4 $ 559.8 $ 127.9 $ 172.0 *Excluding $48.8 million of fair market value from interest rate swap agreements. The long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if the Company was not able to make its principal and interest payments when due, or satisfy certain debt covenants under its revolving credit agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient ongoing cash flow and capital resources to satisfy these obligations and to maintain its required debt covenants. Results of Operations Discussion of Consolidated Results In 2002, earnings increased 24% on essentially flat same location sales. Revenues totaled $4.27 billion, second only to the record set in 2000, and an increase of 3.8% from 2001. Same location sales increased 0.7%, or $27 million, for the full year. Earnings, at $1.17 per diluted share, were up $.23, or 24%, from last years $.94. Pretax restructuring costs were approximately $15 million in 2002, versus $18 million in 2001. During 2001, sales were $4.11 billion, a decrease of 3.8% versus the record sales of $4.28 billion set in 2000, declining for just the second time in the Companys history as a public company. Sales growth from acquisitions was more than offset by a 9.3% decline in same location sales, as decreased unit volumes from weak market demand continued to negatively impact all five business segments. Earnings per diluted share, at $.94 were down $.38, or 29%, from $1.32 in 2000. The following table shows various measures of earnings as a percentage of sales for the last three years. It also shows the effective income tax rate. 2002 2001 2000 Gross profit margin 19.2 % 19.9 % 21.3 % EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin 9.4 8.5 11.2 Net profit margin 5.5 4.6 6.2 Effective income tax rate 35.9 36.9 36.9 The improvement in EBIT margins during 2002 resulted primarily from reduced expenses. Same location sales growth of 0.7% and continued improvements in operating efficiency also helped margins. Cost decreases resulted primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization, lower bad debt, energy and restructuring costs, plus the partial reversal of Canadian lumber duty accruals. Partially offsetting these improvements, and the major factors impacting the decrease in gross profit margin, were higher raw material costs (most notably steel) and margin (i.e., selling price) pressure in some business units. Reduced interest expense as a result of lower borrowings and interest rates also helped improve earnings for 2002. The lower effective income tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 and 2000 levels reflects the impact of eliminating non deductible goodwill amortization as required by FASB Statement No. 142. The declines in 2001 margins primarily reflect weakened demand in all of the Companys business segments, as well as lower than expected performance in the Companys Aluminum Products and Commercial Fixturing & Components segments and some parts of the Residential Furnishings segment. Production cutbacks, 14 Table of Contents plant restructuring and closure costs, reduced plant utilization and resulting lower overhead absorption significantly impacted profit and EBIT margins. Plant utilization in 2001 was further reduced due to the Companys efforts to reduce inventory levels. Margins were also reduced in 2001 by higher bad debt expense, workers compensation costs, medical expenses and energy costs. Lower incentive compensation costs, cost structure improvements and reduced overhead as a result of the Companys tactical plan announced in September 2000 helped offset these increasing costs. Interest expense was lower in 2001 versus 2000, partially offsetting the decline in net margin. Restructuring Activity In connection with its tactical plan announced during the third quarter of 2000 aimed at improving performance, margins and shareholder return, the Companys primary objective was to fix problems in its under performing businesses. Operations that could not be fixed were to be consolidated, closed or sold. As a part of its continued focus on cost structure improvement, through December 2002 the Company had consolidated or sold certain facilities and restructured other operations. The costs incurred related to the Companys restructuring efforts were charged to expense. Included in the Companys operating results for 2002 are restructuring charges of $14.9 million (pretax) associated with these decisions. Charges of $13.3 million are included in Other deductions (income), net, and consist of $12.5 million for fixed asset and goodwill write downs, and $0.8 million in severance and other costs, net of miscellaneous proceeds. The remaining $1.6 million inventory charges are in the Cost of goods sold section on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During 2001, the Company incurred restructuring charges of $18.0 million. Included in Other deductions (income), net are charges of $15.6 million, consisting of $9.6 million for fixed asset and goodwill write downs, and $6.0 million in severance and other costs. The remaining $2.4 million are inventory charges included in Cost of goods sold. During 2000, the Company incurred restructuring charges of $8.6 million. Included in Other deductions (income), net are charges of $6.2 million, consisting of $2.4 million for fixed asset write downs, and $3.8 million in severance and other costs. The remaining $2.4 million are inventory charges included in Cost of goods sold. Restructuring liabilities from 2002 and prior years are not material to the accompanying balance sheet. Adjustments of previously established accruals and liabilities relating to restructuring activities have been negligible. The balances remaining in restructuring reserve on the Companys balance sheet were $3.6 million, $8.6 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company expects to realize future cost savings as a result of these actions, however, the specific impact cannot be quantified, and will be determined by future business conditions. The Company may occasionally rationalize its facility base in the future if compelling savings are evident, or if the economic environment induces such action. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding restructuring activities. Discussion of Segment Results A description of the products included in each segment, segment sales, segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and other segment data appear in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Following is a comparison of EBIT margins (Segment EBIT divided by Total Segment Sales): 2002 2001 2000 Residential Furnishings 10.4 % 8.6 % 10.5 % Commercial Fixturing & Components 5.4 5.6 11.2 Aluminum Products 6.4 5.5 6.7 Industrial Materials 8.3 10.6 13.7 Specialized Products 11.8 10.1 12.5 15 Table of Contents Residential Furnishings sales increased 4.1%, or $84 million during 2002, primarily from a 2.8% increase in same location sales. EBIT increased 26%, or $47 million, due in part from higher sales and cost improvement efforts. Sales of upholstered furniture components increased significantly, but these gains were tempered largely by flat sales in bedding and other product categories. Elimination of $8.0 million of goodwill amortization, partial reversal of Canadian lumber duty accruals, reduced bad debt expense, lower energy costs and $1.6 million in lower restructuring costs all contributed to the EBIT improvements. Margin pressure from higher raw material costs in steel, lumber and chemicals partially offset some of these gains. During 2001, Residential Furnishings sales decreased 4.0%. Same location sales, which were partially offset by acquisitions, decreased 6.1%. EBIT declined $49.2 million, or 21.5%, as soft industry demand and inventory reduction efforts resulted in lower production. The lower plant utilization reduced overhead absorption, yielding lower margins. Also negatively impacting EBIT during 2001 were restructuring charges of $6.5 million. Commercial Fixturing & Components sales decreased 4.9% during 2002. Incremental sales from recent acquisitions were not able to overcome the 9.5%, or $90 million decline in same location sales. Markets for both store fixtures and office furniture components remain depressed, down approximately 20 25% from levels seen two years ago. However, the Company has gained market share in its fixture and display businesses, due in part to the financial difficulties of some competitors brought about by the tough conditions the industry has faced over the past 2 1/2 years. EBIT decreased $5 million, or 9%, with the earnings impact from lower same location sales largely offset by $4.0 million in lower restructuring costs, elimination of $9.0 million of goodwill amortization, and cost structure improvements. During 2001, Commercial Fixturing & Components sales decreased 3.5%, while same location sales, which were partially offset by acquisitions, declined 11.7%. EBIT decreased $56.1 million, or 51.4%, due primarily to lower same location sales and reduced margins, reflecting poor business conditions in the office and contract furniture markets, continued market weakness and reduced fixture purchases in telecom and utility van industries, and plant inefficiencies. Restructuring charges of $8.9 million also negatively impacted EBIT. Aluminum Products sales increased $28 million, or 6.0%, during 2002. Same location sales increased 8.8% for the year, and averaged 14% growth for the final three quarters of the year. The growth is attributable to Leggetts efforts to gain market share, as market demand did not improve appreciably. The Company also divested three firms during 2002, which will reduce annual revenue in the Aluminum Products segment by about $40 million. These divestures will not have a material impact on earnings. EBIT increased 23%, or $6 million. The earnings gain reflected sales increases, which resulted from significant efforts to gain market share. Cost management efforts, reduced amortization expense of $2.5 million and lower energy costs also benefited EBIT. These improvements were partially offset by restructuring costs of $2.8 million and non recurring inventory and equipment obsolescence charges. Higher raw material cost and minor impacts from start up inefficiency associated with new business also reduced EBIT. During 2001, Aluminum Products sales decreased 15.7%. Same location sales were down 17.2%, and were slightly offset by one acquisition. Reduced die cast component sales reflected weak market demand in a variety of consumer and industrial sectors including telecom, electrical, diesel engine and barbecue grill markets. EBIT decreased $11.1 million, or 30.4%. The EBIT decrease resulting from declining sales was partially offset by reduced overhead and lower restructuring costs of $2.1 million. Industrial Materials sales increased 15.9% during 2002, primarily due to acquisitions. Same location sales increased 2.4%. EBIT declined 9%, or $5 million. The majority of the EBIT decline for the year resulted from increased steel prices. These increases began in the second quarter 2002 as a result of tariffs imposed on foreign steel. Steel prices began to stabilize late in the year, and by year end, the Company was able to pass on the majority of the increases to customers. However, there remains some continued impact on margins. Startup costs associated with a steel rod mill also negatively impacted EBIT. Reduced bad debt expense and elimination of $0.9 million in amortization expenses benefited EBIT slightly. 16 Table of Contents The Company acquired the rod mill assets of a bankrupt steel company during the year. The rod mill, which became operational in the first quarter of 2003, will supply about half the Companys steel rod needs, improve the consistency and quality of this key raw material, and will help alleviate supply concerns arising from many recent steel company bankruptcies and recently imposed steel tariffs. The rod produced will be consumed by the Companys wire mills. Inter company sales (at market value) of this steel rod mill should approximate $135 $150 million annually. In 2001, Industrial Materials sales decreased 2.5%. Same location sales were down 9.9%, and were partially offset by acquisitions. EBIT decreased $18.1 million, or 24.5%, primarily as a result of reduced sales volumes and lower plant utilization. Specialized Products sales increased 4.3% in 2002, mainly from a 3.9% increase in same location sales. EBIT increased $8 million, or 21%, due to higher automotive sales and elimination of $3.4 million of goodwill amortization, partially offset by reduced sales volume in the machinery group. The strong performance of our automotive businesses is due primarily to additional market penetration and strong demand for lumbar and seat components. During 2001, Specialized Products sales increased 15.9% due to acquisitions, partially offset by a 2.3% decline in same location sales. EBIT decreased $2.3 million, or 5.5%, due primarily to slowing production and reduced demand in automotive markets and the machinery group, along with changing product mix. Goodwill Amortization The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in 2001. Statement No. 142 requires, among other things, that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be tested periodically for impairment. As required, the Company adopted Statement No. 142 on January 1, 2002, and ceased amortization of goodwill. The goodwill amortization change contributed approximately ten cents per share to 2002 annual earnings. Earnings per share, adjusted for FAS No. 142 treatment of goodwill amortization, would have been $1.04 basic and diluted on pro forma net earnings of $207.8 million in 2001 and $1.42 basic and $1.41 diluted on pro forma net earnings of $282.9 million in 2000. See Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on goodwill amortization. As required by Statement No. 142, the Company tested each of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each unit with the related book value. In each case, the estimated fair value exceeded the book value; accordingly, there was no asset impairment. Seasonality The percent of consolidated net sales by quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions, is as follows for the last three years: 2002 2001 2000 First Quarter 23.8 % 24.9 % 24.7 % Second Quarter 26.0 24.9 25.4 Third Quarter 26.2 26.4 26.1 Fourth Quarter 24.0 23.8 23.8 Year 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The Company does not experience significant seasonality, however, as indicated in the above table, quarter to quarter sales are expected to vary in proportion to the total year by up to 3%. The timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of the Companys businesses. In each of the three years presented, the economic slowdown impacted the Companys various businesses and 17 Table of Contents normal seasonality was likely distorted somewhat. Nevertheless, for the Companys businesses in total, the second and third quarters have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower. Residential Furnishings and Commercial Fixturing & Components typically have their strongest sales in the second and third quarters. Commercial Fixturing & Components has particularly heavy third quarter sales of its store fixtures products, with the first and fourth quarters generally lower. Aluminum Products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to its gas barbecue grill business. Industrial Materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from wire products used for baling cotton. Specialized Products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the first two quarters of the year, and somewhat lower in the third quarter, due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer. Major Accounting Policies, Estimates and Other Factors Influencing Financial Reporting As more fully disclosed in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has adopted numerous accounting policies from among acceptable alternatives, and management must make many critical estimates or assumptions when preparing financial statements. The most critical estimates and assumptions impacting the ongoing operations are as follows: credit losses; costs related to workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property and medical programs; inventory losses from obsolescence; and various assumptions impacting the fair value of the Companys reporting units for goodwill impairment testing under FASB Statement No. 142. With respect to credit losses, the Companys customers are diverse, but many are small to medium size companies and some are highly leveraged. Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning, particularly in the current economic environment, adding to the difficulty in estimating credit losses. Workers compensation and other program costs may require a long period after the actual loss occurred before the exact amount of the cost is known. Estimates of these costs over that period, which in some cases is several years, will vary from the final amount. The Company carries insurance for individual losses that exceed a certain amount specified for each program. Changing customer specifications, technology, customer bankruptcy and other factors result in inventory losses that are difficult to estimate precisely. At any financial statement date, the impact of these factors on inventory value may not be completely known. The Companys accounting estimates of these costs and losses are based on available actuarial estimates, prior experience and close monitoring of each loss exposure. FASB Statement No. 142 requires the Company to periodically test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company has eleven reporting units as defined by FASB Statement No. 142. Major assumptions used in the determination of fair value are future sales growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and the discount rate. Except for the discount rate, these assumptions are initiated by the business managers and reviewed by senior management for reasonableness and consistency. Future actual results, however, will vary from these assumptions. The most significant estimates, other than for ongoing operations, are for exposure to unusual litigation and claims and for the impact of plant restructurings and closings. Accounting periods are impacted by these losses when specific facts are known which affect the loss estimate. The Company has not recorded any significant losses for litigation and claims for 2002 2000, and management is not aware of any significant unrecorded exposures. The Company records restructuring or plant closing losses when specific implementation actions have been approved. No significant income is reflected in the 2002 2000 financial statements for the reversal of restructuring or plant closing losses accrued in a prior period. Changes in the liabilities, reserves and accruals related to the critical estimates and assumptions made above are regularly reviewed by management with the Companys Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 18 Table of Contents New Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements During 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This Statement nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). Statement No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred, instead of recognizing the liability at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The impact on the Company will not be different than under EITF No. 94 3 other than in the period in which such exit or disposal costs are recorded. The Company may occasionally rationalize its facility base in the future if compelling savings are evident, or if the economic environment induces such action, and Statement No. 146 would be applied to any such decisions. During December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company will adopt the prospective transition method permitted by Statements 123 and 148 and begin expensing stock options granted in 2003. Based on current levels, in the first year, implementation of this Statement is expected to reduce earnings by approximately 2 cents per share, and the impact on earnings is expected to grow to approximately 4 cents per share over time. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. (Unaudited) (Dollar amounts in millions) INTEREST RATE The table below provides information about the Companys debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Company has no other significant financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Company has not typically in the past used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. However, during 2000, $350 of 7.65% fixed rate debt maturing in February 2005 and, in 1999, $14 of 6.90% fixed rate debt maturing in June 2004 were issued and converted to variable rate debt by use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements, which contain the same payment dates as the original issues, are used primarily by the Company to manage the fixed/variable interest rate mix of its debt portfolio, and are included as variable rate debt in the table below. In March, 2003, the Company sold its rights under the $350 interest rate swap agreement for $40. Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by $32.1 and $13.8 at December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The fair value of the fixed rate debt was calculated using the U.S. Treasury Bond rate as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Companys interest costs under its medium term note program. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount. 19 Table of Contents Long term debt as of December 31, 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter 2002 2001 Principal fixed rate debt $ 114.5 $ 100.0 $ 25.0 $ 75.0 $ 25.0 $ 95.2 $ 434.7 $ 506.2 Average interest rate 6.27% 6.98% 7.00% 7.12% 7.40% 5.88% 6.60% 6.73% Principal variable rate debt 2.3 14.5 350.5 2.0 29.5 398.8 402.2 Average interest rate 1.59% 2.08% 1.57% 1.65% 1.62% 1.59% 2.17% Miscellaneous debt* 102.8 75.0 Total debt 936.3 983.4 Less: current maturities (127.7 ) (5.8 ) Total long term debt $ 808.6 $ 977.6 * Miscellaneous debt includes $48.8 in 2002 and $38.1 in 2001 of market adjustments resulting from the interest rate swap agreements discussed above. EXCHANGE RATE The Company has not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in other than its functional currencies, although such transactions have not been material in the past. The Company may occasionally hedge firm commitments, other fixed expenses or amounts due in foreign currencies related to its acquisition program. The decision by management to hedge any such transactions is made on a case by case basis. The amount of forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 was approximately $1.9 ($1.6 pay British Pounds/receive USD; $.3 pay Euro/receive USD) and the highest amount during 2002 was approximately $6 ($5 pay USD/ receive Canadian; $1 pay Euro/ receive USD). The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long term commitment, and does not hedge any translation exposures. The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. The Companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries subject to translation exposure at December 31 is as follows: Functional Currency 2002 2001 Canadian Dollar $ 211.6 $ 208.2 European Currencies 221.9 172.2 Mexican Peso 60.5 51.2 Other 33.4 28.4 $ 527.4 $ 460.0 COMMODITY PRICE The Company does not generally use derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposures to changes in commodity prices. The principal commodity price exposure is aluminum, of which the Company had an estimated $36 and $46 (at cost) in inventory at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has purchasing arrangements with customers to mitigate its exposure to aluminum price changes. No other commodity exposures are significant to the Company. 20 Table of Contents
