Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Introduction Leggett & Platt is a Fortune 500, global, multi industry, diversified manufacturer. We conceive, design and produce a broad variety of engineered components and products that can be found in virtually every home, office, retail store, and automobile. We provide very little product directly to consumers, but instead serve a broad array of manufacturers and retailers. Our products are often hidden within, and vital to, our customers products. Key attributes that contribute to our success include: low cost operations, high quality products, vertical integration, innovation, customer service, financial strength, and long lived relationships with customers. We are North Americas leading independent manufacturer of a) components for residential furniture and bedding; b) retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays; c) components for office furniture; d) non automotive aluminum die castings; e) drawn steel wire; f) automotive seat support and lumbar systems; and g) bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting. Our operations are influenced by broad economic factors including interest rates, housing turnover, employment levels, and consumer sentiment, all of which impact consumer spending on durable goods (which drives demand for our components and products). We are also impacted by trends in business capital spending, as about one third of our sales relates to this segment of the economy. Heading into 2004, most of these indicators are favorable and improving. Performance in 2004 will be heavily influenced by three factors: the amount of same location sales growth, our degree of success at recovering escalating steel and other raw material costs, and the extent of improvement in our Fixture & Display operations. Management is devoting significant attention to these areas. We are anticipating full year 2004 same location sales growth to accelerate, as typically occurs following economic downturns. This expectation is heavily influenced by our strong fourth quarter sales, and the increased demand that our markets are currently experiencing. 18 Table of Contents Steel prices are increasing rapidly as we enter 2004. This basic material represents nearly 15% of our cost of goods sold. Demand for steel is high, and supply is tight, leading to sharp cost increases since last summer. Late in 2003, we began passing along price increases to recover these costs. Improving performance of our Fixture & Display operations is a high priority heading into 2004. These factors and others are discussed below. Results of Operations Discussion of Consolidated Results 2003 vs. 2002 Sales increased 2.7%, and at $4.39 billion, were a record for the Company. Same location sales increased 1.2%, or $52 million, due to currency rate changes as overall volume was flat. Net earnings decreased 12%, or $27 million, to $206 million. Factors contributing to this decline include the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies (about $16 million after tax), increased energy costs (about $16 million after tax), and unusually high obsolete and slow moving inventory reserves (about $6 million after tax). Earnings also decreased from unabsorbed overhead in businesses with lower production levels, operating inefficiency in certain locations, and increased steel costs. Partially offsetting these negative factors were higher sales, lower restructuring costs ($10 million after tax), reduced bad debt expense ($6 million after tax), and income tax rate reductions. The income tax rate reduction, from 35.9% in 2002 to 34.7% in 2003, primarily resulted from the realization of foreign tax credit carryforwards. 2002 vs. 2001 Earnings increased 24% on essentially flat same location sales. Sales totaled $4.27 billion, an increase of 3.8% from 2001. Same location sales increased 0.7%, or $27 million, for the full year. Net earnings increased $46 million to $233 million. Reduced expenses account for the bulk of the 2002 earnings improvement. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which required that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be tested periodically for impairment. This change contributed about $20 million to net earnings. Other cost decreases resulted from continuing improvements in operating efficiency, lower restructuring costs, and reduced expenses for energy (about $6 million after tax), bad debts ($8 million after tax), and interest ($11 million after tax). Higher raw material costs (notably steel) and stiff price competition in some business units partially offset these improvements. Major Trends and Uncertainties Late in 2003, Leggett began experiencing rapid and significant steel cost increases, and these increases have accelerated in early 2004. As of mid March, market prices for purchase of steel (including scrap, rod, rolled, and angle iron) are running $150250 dollars per ton above prices seen during the summer of 2003. The majority of the increase in steel prices has occurred since November. We purchase 1.3 million tons of steel each year, accounting for nearly 15% of our cost of goods sold. Cost increases of this magnitude significantly affect our profitability. We have recently announced or implemented selling price increases in most segments to recover these higher costs. The future pricing of steel is uncertain at this point. The degree to which the Company is able to mitigate or recover these escalating costs is a major factor impacting future results. Availability of steel is also becoming an issue. Worldwide steel production capacity declined in recent years due to bankruptcies of domestic steel producers. At the same time, worldwide demand for steel is increasing, driving prices significantly higher. Although some uncertainty over steel availability exists, we believe we are 19 Table of Contents better positioned than our competitors to secure supply. Steel scrap and rod represent about 70% of our steel purchases (this material is converted to wire, which is the raw material used by many of our operations). Half of the steel rod we use comes from our own mill, helping ensure supply. In addition, our financial strength and purchasing leverage are advantages many of our competitors dont enjoy. Natural gas prices during 2003 were 80% higher on average than in 2002. While we dont believe this rate of increase will continue, some uncertainty exists. We ended 2003 with prices locked in on about 60% of our domestic and Canadian natural gas requirements through June 2004. These hedge prices averaged $5.63 per mmbtu. In certain of our markets, a portion of U.S. manufacturing is moving overseas. As that occurs, we must establish operations in new regions of the world to continue supplying our customers. Currently, the largest influence on our markets is coming from China. At the end of 2003, Leggett operated eight Chinese facilities. Generally, we can produce components at a lower cost in the U.S. However, as our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we must be located nearby to supply them efficiently. In addition to our own facilities in China, we have strong relationships with many Asian suppliers. As we continue to expand internationally, more facilities are operated in foreign countries resulting in increased exposure to foreign currencies. Leggett currently hedges only a modest amount of these exposures with derivative instruments. Significant changes in the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies could impact future results. The recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Canadian dollar, contributed to 2003s earnings decline. Some of our Canadian operations sell to U.S. customers in U.S. dollars but incur their costs in Canadian dollars. These operations have experienced margin deterioration in 2003. Price increases have been implemented in some of these operations, but U.S. competitors, who are not experiencing this impact, make raising prices more difficult. In October 2003, we announced increased attention to our poorly performing Fixture & Display operations. This tactical plan aims to accomplish improved operating efficiency, better adherence to standard costs, tighter inventory controls, cost reductions, and more competent staffing. The success of this plan could have a significant impact on future operating results. Additional comments regarding the impact of margin improvements in these businesses are included later in this discussion. In the last half of 2003, the Company began to see improving trends in many of its businesses. All five segments reported increases in same location sales in the fourth quarter, and we expect these improvements to continue in 2004. Additional comments regarding these recent trends are included in the discussion of segment results that follows. Discussion of Segment Results A description of the products included in each segment, along with segment financial data, appear in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Following is a comparison of EBIT margins (Segment EBIT divided by Segment Total Sales): 2003 2002 2001 Residential Furnishings 9.5 % 10.4 % 8.6 % Commercial Fixturing & Components 2.8 5.4 5.6 Aluminum Products 7.6 6.4 5.5 Industrial Materials 6.5 8.3 10.6 Specialized Products 10.8 11.8 10.1 20 Table of Contents Residential Furnishings 2003 vs. 2002 Sales increased 2.5%, or $55 million, as same location sales gained 1.4%. Most operating units experienced a rebound in customer demand in the second half of the year. Full year improvements were reported in several categories, including upholstered furniture components, ornamental and adjustable beds, and carpet underlay. Sales from foreign operations also increased for the year, in part from currency impacts, as foreign currencies now convert to more U.S. dollars. These gains were partially offset by sales declines in our fiber operations. Sales in our U.S. bedding components businesses also decreased for the full year due to weak demand in early 2003. Beginning in June, demand improved and our bedding components operations posted growth during the second half of the year. EBIT decreased 6%, or $14 million, as higher steel and energy costs, impacts from the weaker U.S. dollar, and unabsorbed overhead from lower production rates at U.S. bedding components operations during the first half of the year more than offset the benefit from increased sales. In addition, lower restructuring costs were offset by the non recurrence of a partial reversal of a Canadian lumber duty accrual. 2002 vs. 2001 Sales increased 4.1%, or $84 million, primarily from a 2.8% increase in same location sales. EBIT increased 26%, or $47 million, partially due to higher sales and cost improvement efforts. Sales of upholstered furniture components increased significantly, but these gains were tempered by flat sales in bedding and other product categories. Elimination of $8 million of goodwill amortization, partial reversal of Canadian lumber duty accruals, reduced bad debt expense, lower energy costs, and lower restructuring costs contributed to the EBIT improvement. Higher raw material costs in steel, lumber and chemicals partially offset these improvements. Commercial Fixturing & Components 2003 vs. 2002 Sales increased 7.4%, or $66 million, due to incremental sales from acquisitions, offset slightly by a 0.4% decrease in same location sales. Although certain major retailers continued with new store openings and refurbishments in 2003, most continued at reduced capital spending levels. Demand for office furniture components also remained at very low levels throughout 2003. However, modest improvements occurred in this market late in the year. In July 2003, we purchased the assets of RHC Spacemaster, a producer of store fixtures. This acquisition should add at least $120 million to annual revenues and is expected to be modestly profitable in the first full year. EBIT for the segment decreased $22 million, or 45%, primarily due to inventory write downs, the weakening of the U.S. dollar, higher steel costs, operational inefficiency, and price competition. Lower restructuring costs offset some of these negative factors. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company announced a focused management effort to improve the operating efficiency and margins of the Fixture & Display portion of this segment. 2002 vs. 2001 Sales decreased 4.9% as incremental sales from recent acquisitions were unable to overcome the 9.5%, or $90 million, decline in same location sales. Markets for both retail fixtures and office furniture components were down approximately 20% 25% from peak levels in 2000. However, the Company gained market share in its Fixture & Display business, owing in part to the financial difficulties of some competitors brought about by the tough conditions the industry faced in recent years. EBIT decreased $5 million, or 9%, with the earnings impact from lower same location sales largely offset by $4 million in lower restructuring costs, elimination of $9 million of goodwill amortization, and cost structure improvements. 21 Table of Contents Aluminum Products 2003 vs. 2002 Sales decreased $21 million or 4.2%. Same location sales increased 2.5%, but three recent divestitures reduced sales by $32 million. No acquisitions were made during 2003. New programs for castings used in motorcycles, small engines, and large appliances represented the majority of the same location sales increase. These gains were partially offset by a decline in sales of barbeque grill castings. EBIT increased $4 million, or 14%, partially due to same location sales growth. Lower restructuring and non recurring charges benefited EBIT by approximately $6 million, but were offset by an unfavorable change in sales mix. 2002 vs. 2001 Sales increased $28 million, or 6.0%. This gain reflected an 8.8% increase in same location sales, partially offset by three divestitures. There were no acquisitions during the year. The same location sales growth was primarily attributable to new programs with existing and new customers, as overall market demand did not improve appreciably. EBIT increased 23%, or $6 million, primarily reflecting the same location sales increases. Cost management efforts, reduced goodwill amortization expense of $3 million, and lower energy costs also benefited EBIT. These improvements were partially offset by restructuring costs of $3 million and non recurring inventory and equipment obsolescence charges of $3 million. Higher raw material cost and minor impacts from start up inefficiency associated with new business also reduced EBIT. The divestitures did not have a material impact on earnings. Industrial Materials 2003 vs. 2002 Sales decreased 5.3%, or $32 million, reflecting a 5.1% reduction in same location sales. The sales decline resulted from weakness in many of our end markets, including wire demand from bedding manufacturers (in the first half of 2003), and tubing demand for ATVs and accessories. Certain markets began to recover late in the year, and volumes improved, particularly in the wire drawing operations. EBIT decreased 26%, or $13 million, due to lower sales and production volume, and higher steel and energy costs. These factors were partially offset by the elimination of start up costs associated with the Sterling rod mill, lower restructuring charges, and a gain from the sale of a tubing fabrication business. 2002 vs. 2001 Sales increased 15.9%, primarily due to acquisitions, with same location sales increasing 2.4%. EBIT declined 9%, or $5 million. The majority of the EBIT decline for the year resulted from increased steel prices. These increases began in the second quarter 2002 as a result of tariffs imposed on foreign steel. We experienced delays in implementing price increases in certain businesses, but by late 2002, the majority of the increases had been passed along to customers. Additional EBIT declines resulted from costs associated with the start up of the Sterling rod mill and further restructuring efforts. Reduced bad debt expense and lower amortization benefited EBIT slightly. Specialized Products 2003 vs. 2002 Sales increased 11.6%, or $47 million, largely from a 10.7% gain in same location sales. New automotive programs, increased shipments of bedding machinery during the second half of 2003, and currency rates positively impacted sales. 22 Table of Contents EBIT increased slightly, reflecting higher sales, but these improvements were offset by impacts from the weaker U.S dollar, sales mix, and other smaller factors. 2002 vs. 2001 Sales increased 4.3%, mainly from a 3.9% increase in same location sales. EBIT increased $8 million, or 21%, due to higher automotive sales and elimination of $3 million of goodwill amortization, partially offset by reduced sales volume in our machinery operations. The strong performance of our automotive businesses was due primarily to additional market penetration and strong demand for lumbar and seat components. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As more fully disclosed in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have adopted numerous accounting policies from among acceptable alternatives. Management must make many critical estimates or assumptions when preparing financial statements. Our major estimates and assumptions are discussed below. The first group of comments addresses estimates that impact our earnings each year, and later, we identify and discuss major estimates that impact earnings less frequently. The most critical estimates and assumptions impacting our ongoing results are: credit losses costs related to workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property, and medical programs inventory losses from obsolescence income taxes With respect to credit losses, our customers are diverse, but many are small to medium sized companies and some are highly leveraged. Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning, particularly in a changing economic environment, adding to the difficulty in estimating credit losses. Workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property, and medical insurance costs may require an extended period after the actual loss occurred before the exact amount of the cost is known. Estimates of these costs over that period, which in some cases is several years, will vary from the final amount. We carry insurance for individual losses that exceed a certain amount specified for each program. Changing customer specifications, technology, customer bankruptcy and other factors result in inventory losses that are difficult to estimate precisely. At any financial statement date, the impact of these factors on inventory value may not be completely known. Income taxes are recorded by the Company at rates in effect in the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company has tax loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions and foreign tax credit carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes. Valuation reserves are established against these future potential tax benefits based on Managements estimate of their ultimate realization. Actual realization of these benefits may vary from Managements estimates. Also, Management has made certain assumptions about the distribution of earnings from subsidiaries which may not be accurate in the future, thereby affecting the tax impact of such earnings. Finally, ultimate resolution of issues raised by ongoing tax audits is not predictable and could affect the Companys tax liabilities. Our accounting estimates of these costs and losses are based on available actuarial estimates, prior experience and close monitoring of each exposure. We believe our reserves for these potential losses are adequate. 23 Table of Contents The next group of comments addresses estimates that may occasionally impact our earnings. The most significant of these estimates are: goodwill and asset impairments unusual litigation and claims plant restructurings and closings Losses related to these items are recognized when specific facts which affect the estimate are known. Goodwill impairment is formally assessed annually, as required by SFAS No. 142, and also when we experience significant negative deviations from the assumptions underlying the fair market valuation of each reporting unit. Asset impairments are monitored by periodically focusing on underperforming locations with insufficient cash flows. Many assumptions about the future are necessary in the determination of fair market value for each of our eleven reporting units (as defined by SFAS No. 142). The key assumptions are discount rate, organic sales growth, EBIT margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements. No goodwill impairment has been determined to date for any of our reporting units. The key assumptions are re evaluated annually, or more frequently if significant changes become apparent, using Managements most recent assessment of the performance potential of each reporting unit. Recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor, but not the only factor, in Managements annual assessment. Fair market values calculated for each reporting unit may go up or down each year based on a re evaluation of the key assumptions. The Companys Fixture & Display operations have experienced deterioration in profitability over the past few years, in part due to external market factors, but also due to unsatisfactory internal performance. The Company is responding with a strategic initiative aimed at improving operating efficiency, integrating recent acquisitions, cutting costs, and restoring margins. This endeavor may require changing the business model, raising prices or walking away from certain customer relationships, and shutting down or consolidating certain production facilities. About $300 million of the Companys goodwill is associated with these operations. In order to avoid possible future impairment of this goodwill, margins must improve. The Company has not recorded any significant losses for litigation and claims in the last three years, and Management is not aware of any significant unrecorded exposures. We record restructuring or plant closing losses when specific actions have been implemented and the liability incurred. No significant income is reflected in the financial statements for the reversal of restructuring or plant closing losses accrued in a prior period. Capital Resources and Liquidity Leggett serves a variety of industries that have different capital expenditure and working capital requirements. We have sufficient capital resources to meet our current operating needs, and also to support future growth. We attempt to achieve a balance between debt and equity, striving to minimize the total cost of capital, without excessive leverage. Leggett maintains a target for long term debt of 30 40% of total capitalization. Short term Liquidity We rely on cash flow from operations as our primary source of capital. Despite depressed net earnings for the last three years, we have been able to mitigate the impact on cash flow by reducing capital spending and acquisitions, and focusing on working capital management. Also, in 2003 we took advantage of historically low interest rates by issuing fixed rate debt with maturities of 10 and 15 years. As a result, we have been able to increase cash and equivalents to a level that provides adequate liquidity to finance ongoing operations, pay down debt maturing in the near term, and fund a portion of our future growth. 24 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities was $395 million, $456 million and $535 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2003 and 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflects a slowing of working capital decreases, partially offset by increased earnings. Total working capital increased in 2003, primarily from higher cash balances, currency impacts, and acquisitions. Year end accounts receivable increased due to strong December sales. Working capital levels vary by segment, with Aluminum Products and Commercial Fixturing & Components requirements generally higher than Company averages. Accounts receivable balances in these segments are typically higher due to the longer credit and collection time required to service certain customers of the aluminum die casting and Fixture & Display businesses. These same businesses also require higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of their products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time. Total Capitalization The following table shows Leggetts total capitalization at the end of the three most recent years. The table also shows the amount of unused committed credit available through our revolving bank credit agreements, current maturities of long term debt, the amount of cash and cash equivalents, and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. 2003 2002 2001 (Dollar amounts in millions) Long term debt outstanding: Scheduled maturities $ 1,012 $ 809 $ 978 Average interest rates 4.1 % 4.3 % 4.8 % Average maturities in years 6.0 3.4 4.0 Revolving credit/commercial paper Total long term debt 1,012 809 978 Deferred income taxes and other liabilities 138 117 111 Shareholders equity 2,114 1,977 1,867 Total capitalization $ 3,264 $ 2,903 $ 2,956 Unused committed credit: Long term $ 213 $ 233 $ 233 Short term 127 107 110 Total unused committed credit $ 340 $ 340 $ 343 Current maturities of long term debt $ 119 $ 128 $ 6 Cash and cash equivalents $ 444 $ 225 $ 187 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges * 6.2x 7.6x 5.2x * Fixed charges include interest expense plus a factor for implied interest included in operating leases. 25 Table of Contents This next table shows the calculation of long term debt as a percent of total capitalization, net of cash and current maturities, at December 31, 2003 and 2002. We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities more appropriately reflects financial leverage, since cash is readily available to repay debt. These adjustments also enable meaningful comparisons to historical periods. Prior to the second quarter of 2002, current debt maturities were essentially zero, and prior to the third quarter of 2001, cash balances were much smaller. 2003 2002 (Dollar amounts inmillions) Long term debt $ 1,012 $ 809 Current debt maturities 119 128 Cash and cash equivalents (444 ) (225 ) Net debt, after adjustments $ 687 $ 712 Total capitalization $ 3,264 $ 2,903 Current debt maturities 119 128 Cash and cash equivalents (444 ) (225 ) Total capitalization, after adjustments $ 2,939 $ 2,806 Debt to total capitalization Before adjustments 31.0 % 27.9 % After adjustments 23.4 % 25.4 % Total debt increased $195 million from year end 2002, primarily due to the issuance of $200 million in 10 year notes at a 4.7% coupon rate in March 2003, and the issuance of $150 million in 15 year notes at a 4.4% coupon rate in June 2003. We issued this debt to take advantage of current low interest rates and to extend maturities. These increases were offset by debt repayments of approximately $144 million. In the first quarter of 2003, we also liquidated an interest rate swap agreement and received $40 million in cash proceeds. The proceeds from the notes and liquidation of the swap agreement will be used for repayment of existing debt (approximately $470 million comes due through the first quarter 2005), stock repurchases, the financing of future acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Obligations having scheduled maturities are the primary source of Leggetts debt capital. At the end of 2003, these obligations consisted primarily of our medium term notes. Our public debt currently carries a Moodys rating of A2 and a Standard & Poors rating of A+. We have maintained an A rating on our debt for over a decade. The secondary source of Leggetts debt capital consists of a $300 million commercial paper program supported by $340 million in revolving credit agreements. Leggett has had no commercial paper outstanding during the last three years. To further facilitate the issuance of debt capital, $150 million remains available under our $500 million shelf registration. We believe that we have sufficient unused committed credit to ensure that future capital resources are adequate for our ongoing operations and growth opportunities. Additional details of long term debt are discussed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Uses of Capital Resources The Companys investments to modernize and expand manufacturing capacity totaled $389 million in the last three years. In 2004, management anticipates capital spending will approximate $135 million, primarily for maintaining and expanding production capacity. During the last three years, the Company employed $261 million of cash (net of cash acquired) in acquisitions. In 2003, 15 businesses were acquired for $120 million in 26 Table of Contents cash (net of cash acquired). We also assumed $21 million of acquired companies debt and other liabilities. Of the 15 acquisitions in 2003, nine should add about $60 million in annual sales to Residential Furnishings, three should contribute approximately $140 million to Commercial Fixturing & Components, and three should increase Specialized Products sales by around $20 million. Additional details of acquisitions are discussed in Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment details are shown in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash dividends on the Companys common stock in the last three years totaled $292 million and increased at an 8.7% compounded annual rate. Our long term target for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three years average earnings. Calculated in the same manner as our target, dividend payout was 51.3% in 2003, 43.7% in 2002 and 38.8% in 2001. As earnings recover, we expect to move back toward the 30 35% dividend payout target. Company purchases of its common stock (net of issuances) totaled $79 million in 2003, $81 million in 2002, and $51 million in 2001. These purchases were made primarily to replace shares issued in employee stock plans. Each year, the Board of Directors authorizes management, at its discretion, to buy up to two million shares of Leggett stock for use in employee benefit plans or for other purposes. This authorization is continuously replenished as shares acquired are reissued. In addition, management is authorized, again at its discretion, to repurchase any shares issued in acquisitions. At the end of the third quarter 2000, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of Leggett stock. The Board of Directors has continued this authorization for an additional period expiring in September 2004. As of December 31, 2003, we had acquired approximately 2.9 million shares under this authorization. A specific repurchase schedule has not been established under this authorization. The amount and timing of purchases will depend on economic and market conditions, acquisition activity, and other factors. The following table summarizes Leggetts future contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollar amounts in millions) Long term debt* $ 1,109 $ 119 $ 471 $ 111 $ 408 Operating leases 119 35 44 24 16 Purchase obligations** 430 430 Other long term obligations 42 13 5 24 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,700 $ 584 $ 528 $ 140 $ 448 * Long term debt excludes $23 million of market value adjustments related to interest rate swap agreements and includes $37 million of capitalized leases. The long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if the Company was not able to make its principal and interest payments when due. However, we believe we have sufficient capital resources to satisfy these obligations. ** Purchase obligations primarily include open short term (30 120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating the Companys facilities. Restructuring Activity During 2003, Leggett divested two small operations, and closed or consolidated six other facilities. Results of operations for 2003 include charges of approximately $2 million relating to these activities, offset by a 27 Table of Contents $3 million gain on the sale of a tubing fabrication business. Certain other facilities are currently being reviewed and may be consolidated or closed during 2004. We anticipate only modest restructuring charges from these activities, in line with those recognized the past few years. During 2002, we announced the divestiture or closure of seven operations. Three of these facilities were in the Aluminum Products segment, two were in Commercial Fixturing & Components, and two were in Residential Furnishings. In September 2002, we sold our remaining aluminum smelting facility and a tool & die operation, and in November 2002, we sold a small die casting plant. Leggett also announced the closing of two Fixture & Display facilities, the largest of which served the telecom industry. Finally, we closed two fiber operations in our Residential Furnishing segment. Restructuring charges related to these activities totaled $15 million. During 2001 we closed or consolidated 12 operations. Seven of these facilities were in Residential Furnishings, including four fiber operations, two foam businesses, and one small bedding components plant. In Commercial Fixturing & Components, two Fixture & Display operations were consolidated into other facilities, and another was sold. A wire drawing plant in Industrial Materials was closed. And finally, in Specialized Products, we closed a small automotive operation in Europe. Restructuring charges totaled $18 million in 2001. Restructuring liabilities are not material to the Companys balance sheet. Adjustments of previously established accruals relating to restructuring activities have been negligible. Seasonality The percent of consolidated net sales by quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions, is as follows for the last three years: 2003 2002 2001 First Quarter 23.9 % 23.8 % 24.9 % Second Quarter 26.0 26.0 24.9 Third Quarter 26.3 26.2 26.4 Fourth Quarter 23.8 24.0 23.8 Year 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The Company does not experience significant seasonality, however, as indicated in the above table, quarter to quarter sales can vary in proportion to the total year by about 2.5%. The timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. In each of the three years presented, the economic slowdown impacted our various businesses and normal seasonality was likely somewhat distorted. Nevertheless, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower. Residential Furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during the late summer and fall months. Commercial Fixturing & Components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixtures products, with the first and fourth quarters normally lower. This aligns with the industrys normal construction cycle, and the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season. Aluminum Products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to typically stronger spring and early summer demand for barbeque grills. Industrial Materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from higher demand for bedding products and seasonal demand for wire ties used for baling cotton (which is typically harvested in the early fall). Specialized Products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and somewhat lower in the third quarter, due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer. 28 Table of Contents New Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. This Interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities. If a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements by March 31, 2004. The Company has a small number of insignificant interests that could be affected by these new accounting standards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Disclosures About Market Risk Leggett & Platt, Incorporated and Subsidiaries (Unaudited) (Dollar amounts in millions) INTEREST RATE The table below provides information about the Companys debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Company has no other significant financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates. During 2000, $350 of 7.65% fixed rate debt maturing in February 2005 and, in 1999, $14 of 6.90% fixed rate debt maturing in June 2004 were issued and converted to variable rate debt by use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements, which contain the same payment dates as the original issues, are used primarily by the Company to manage the fixed/variable interest rate mix of its debt portfolio. In March 2003, the Company sold its rights under the $350 interest rate swap agreement for $39.9. Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by $14.3 and $32.1 at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using the U.S. Treasury Bond rate as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Companys interest costs under its medium term note program. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

This agreement is designated as a net investment hedge. The purpose of this swap is to hedge the CHF denominated assets with a CHF denominated liability, thereby reducing volatility of exposure to the CHF. In addition, the terms of this agreement include that the Company will receive interest on $30 USD at a fixed rate of 6.35% and pay interest on 38.3 million (CHF) at a fixed rate of 4.71%. At December 31, 2003, the market value of the cross currency swap was approximately $(.5). EXCHANGE RATE The Company does not hedge all net foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in other than its functional currencies. The Company may occasionally hedge specific commitments or other anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies. The decision by management to hedge any such transactions is made on a case by case basis. The amount of forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 was approximately $17.7 ($13.6 Pay USD/Receive MXN; $2.6 Pay GBP/Receive USD; and $1.5 Pay USD/Receive CNY). The highest amount during 2003 was approximately $18.7 ($14.1 Pay USD/Receive MXN; $2.9 Pay GBP/Receive USD; $1.5 Pay USD/Receive CNY; and $.2 Pay GBP/Receive CAD). The USD/MXN contracts hedge anticipated fixed expenses and the remaining contracts hedge specific asset or liability exposures. The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long term commitment. The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes. The Companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries subject to translation exposure at December 31 is as follows: Functional Currency 2003 2002 Canadian Dollar $ 254.7 $ 211.6 European Currencies 271.0 221.9 Mexican Peso 49.8 60.5 Other 61.0 33.4 $ 636.5 $ 527.4 NATURAL GAS ENERGY SWAP AGREEMENTS The Company has hedged about 60% of its anticipated domestic and Canadian natural gas purchases through June 2004, of which approximately $9.5 remain outstanding at December 31, 2003. The average price under the contracts is $5.63 per mmbtu. There was no significant gain or loss on these contracts, realized or unrealized, as of December 31, 2003. COMMODITY PRICE The Company does not generally use derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposures to changes in commodity prices, except as noted above. The principal commodity price exposure is aluminum, of which the Company had an estimated $36 (at cost) in inventory at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company has purchasing procedures and arrangements with customers to mitigate its exposure to aluminum price changes. No other commodity exposures are significant to the Company.
