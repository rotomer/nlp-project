Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Some of the statements contained in the following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are "forward looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the statements anticipate. Factors which may affect our results include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, the market for homes generally or in areas where we have developments, the availability and cost of land suitable for residential development, materials prices, labor costs, interest rates, consumer confidence, competition, environmental factors and government regulations affecting our operations. 9 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We achieved record revenues, profits and earnings per share in 2001. Our net earnings in 2001 were $417.8 million, or $6.01 per share diluted, compared to $229.1 million, or $3.64 per share diluted, in 2000. The increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of U.S. Home Corporation ("U.S. Home"), which contributed a full year of earnings in 2001, compared to seven months contributed in 2000. With $824 million of cash and our $1 billion revolving credit facilities fully paid down to zero, our net homebuilding debt to total capital ratio (debt is net of homebuilding cash) was 29.1% at November 30, 2001, compared to 44.0% last year. Our record earnings combined with a strong balance sheet contributed to a return on net capital (debt is net of homebuilding cash) of approximately 20% in 2001, compared to approximately 14% in 2000. Homebuilding Our Homebuilding Division sells and constructs homes primarily for entry level, move up and active adult homebuyers. We also use a dual marketing strategy in which we sell homes under both our "Everythings Included/SM/" and "Design Studio/SM/" programs. Our land operations include the purchase, development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities, as well as the sale of land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risk by forming partnerships with other entities. The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information for the years indicated. The results of U.S. Home are included in the information since its acquisition in May 2000.

Central: Texas, Minnesota and Ohio. West: California, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada. In addition, we have unconsolidated partnerships in Georgia, Michigan, Missouri and North Carolina. Revenues from sales of homes increased 33% in 2001 and 54% in 2000 compared to the previous years as a result of a 27% increase and a 45% increase in the number of home deliveries, and a 5% increase and a 7% increase in the average sales price in 2001 and 2000, respectively. New home deliveries were higher primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of U.S. Homes homebuilding activity in 2001, compared to seven months inclusion in 2000. The average sales price of homes delivered increased in 2001 and 2000 primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets, combined with changes in our product mix. During 2001, U.S. Home and its subsidiaries contributed 40% of both our homebuilding revenues and our homebuilding expenses. During 2000, during which we owned U.S. Home and its subsidiaries for seven months, U.S. Home and its subsidiaries contributed 31% of our homebuilding revenues and 32% of our homebuilding expenses. Gross margin percentages on home sales were 23.9%, 20.4% and 21.2% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to improved operational efficiencies and strength in the homebuilding markets in which we operate. The decrease in the gross margin percentage in 2000 compared to 1999 was impacted by purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of U.S. Home. The gross margin percentage in 2000 would have been 21.3% excluding the effect of purchase accounting. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 10.5% in 2001 compared to 10.0% and 10.2% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses, compared to 2000. We provide incentives to our associates to achieve 11 the highest level of financial performance and combined with our record results in 2001, resulted in significantly higher bonuses when compared to 2000. The improvement in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted primarily from the increased volume and efficiencies realized from the acquisition of U.S. Home in May 2000. Revenues from land sales totaled $87.2 million in 2001, compared to $243.5 million in 2000 and $150.3 million in 1999. Gross profits from land sales totaled $4.6 million, or a 5.2% margin, in 2001, compared to $27.6 million, or an 11.3% margin, in 2000 and $22.2 million, or a 14.8% margin, in 1999. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships increased to $27.1 million in 2001, compared to $13.3 million in 2000 and $19.5 million in 1999. Margins achieved on sales of land and equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales by us and our unconsolidated partnerships. New home orders increased 34% in 2001 and 56% in 2000 compared to the previous years. The increases in 2001 and 2000 were due to the inclusion of a full year of U.S. Homes homebuilding activity in 2001 and seven months of U.S. Homes homebuilding activity in 2000. Backlog dollar value was $2.0 billion at November 30, 2001, compared to $2.1 billion at November 30, 2000, due primarily to lower new orders in the months immediately following the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Financial Services Our Financial Services Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both our homebuyers and others. The Division also resells the residential mortgage loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market and provides high speed Internet access, cable television and alarm monitoring services for both our homebuyers and other customers. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services Division. The results of U.S. Homes financial services operations are included in the information since its acquisition in May 2000. Years Ended November 30, 2001 2000 1999 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues..................................... $ 425,354 316,934 269,307 Costs and expenses........................... 336,223 273,339 238,211 Operating earnings........................... $ 89,131 43,595 31,096 Dollar value of mortgages originated......... $5,225,568 3,240,252 2,162,479 Number of mortgages originated............... 30,600 20,800 14,900 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers... 79% 73% 63% Number of title transactions................. 173,000 120,000 139,000 Operating earnings from our Financial Services Division increased to $89.1 million in 2001 compared to $43.6 million and $31.1 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 was partially attributable to pretax earnings of approximately $16 million primarily related to the sale of our retained mortgage servicing rights. Additionally, the increase reflects the successful operational efficiencies which resulted from the combination of our and U.S. Homes mortgage operations under the Universal American Mortgage banner and the consolidation of our title operations under the North American Title banner. The increase also reflects a greater level of refinance activity and a higher capture rate of our homebuyers as well as a full year of earnings contribution from U.S. Home in 2001. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to the seven months of earnings contribution from U.S. Home. The earnings contribution from U.S. Home represented 26% of the Divisions operating earnings in 2001 and 28% of the Divisions operating earnings in 2000. Corporate General and Administrative Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in 2001 compared to 1.1% and 1.2% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 12 Interest Interest expense was $119.5 million, or 2.0% of total revenues, in 2001, $98.6 million, or 2.1% of total revenues, in 2000 and $48.9 million, or 1.6% of total revenues, in 1999. Interest incurred was $127.9 million, $117.4 million and $54.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The average rates for interest incurred were 7.6%, 6.2% and 6.2% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The average debt outstanding was $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $0.8 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At November 30, 2001, we had available cash of $824.0 million, compared to $287.6 million at the end of fiscal 2000. The increase in cash was primarily due to $417.8 million of net earnings generated from operations during 2001. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2001 were reduced by financial services loans held for sale or disposition of $211.1 million and $57.1 million in receivables. We sell the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market, generally within thirty days of the closing of the loan. The cash related to these loans and receivables was primarily received in December 2001 and was used to pay down our warehouse lines of credit. Additionally, although inventories decreased $223.3 million in 2000, they increased $130.7 million in 2001, as we positioned ourselves for future growth. Cash provided by investing activities was $1.9 million in 2001, compared to cash used in investing activities of $186.7 million in 2000. In 2001, $10.8 million was provided by the sale of substantially all of our mortgage servicing rights and $5.6 million related to net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest. This generation of cash was offset by $13.1 million of net additions to operating properties and equipment. In 2000, $158.4 million of cash was used in the acquisitions of properties and businesses, which included $152.4 million used for the acquisition of U.S. Home. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations, as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities. In addition, we have in recent years sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets, and we have an effective Securities Act registration statement under which we could sell to the public up to $970 million of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock. We also buy land under option agreements, which permit us to acquire portions of properties when we are ready to build homes on them. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings is managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process, limitation of risk by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land and obtaining access to land through option arrangements. Our senior secured credit facilities provide us with up to $1.4 billion of financing. The credit facilities consist of a $715 million five year revolving credit facility, a $300 million 364 day revolving credit facility and a $400 million term loan B. We may elect to convert borrowings under the 364 day revolving credit facility to a term loan which would mature in May 2005. At November 30, 2001, there was $395 million outstanding under the term loan B and we had paid down our revolving credit facilities to zero. In the second quarter of 2001, we issued, for gross proceeds of approximately $230 million, zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021 ("Notes") with a face amount at maturity of approximately $633 million. The Notes were issued at a price of $363.46 per $1,000 face amount at maturity, which equates to a yield to maturity over the life of the Notes of 5.125%. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount, were approximately $224 million. We used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and added the balance of the net proceeds to our working capital. The Notes are convertible into our common stock at any time, if the sale price of our common stock exceeds certain thresholds or in other specified instances, at the rate of approximately 6.4 shares per $1,000 face amount at maturity, or a total of approximately 4 million shares. The conversion ratio equates to an initial conversion price of $56.93 per share (when our stock price was $43.13 per share). These shares will be included in the calculation of our diluted earnings per share if the average closing price of our common stock over the last twenty trading days of each quarter exceeds 110% of the accreted conversion price. This calculation equated to $64.79 per share at November 30, 2001. Holders have the option to require us to repurchase the Notes on any of the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to the purchase date. We have the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and or shares of common stock. We have the option to redeem the 13 Notes, in cash, at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to redemption. We will pay contingent interest on the Notes during specified six month periods beginning on April 4, 2006 if the market price of the Notes exceeds specified levels. At November 30, 2001, the carrying value of the outstanding Notes, net of unamortized original issue discount, was $235.9 million. As a result of the U.S. Home acquisition, holders of U.S. Homes publicly held notes totaling $525 million were entitled to require U.S. Home to repurchase the notes for 101% of their principal amount within 90 days after the transaction was completed. Independent of that requirement, in April 2000, we made a tender offer for all of the notes and a solicitation of consents to modify provisions of the indentures relating to the notes. As a result of the tender offer and required repurchases after the acquisition, we paid approximately $520 million in 2000, which includes tender and consent fees, for $508 million of U.S. Homes notes. In May 2000, we issued $325 million of 9.95% senior notes due 2010 at a price of 92.313% to finance a portion of the purchase price of U.S. Homes publicly held notes that were tendered in response to our offer and consent solicitation in April 2000, and to pay associated costs and expenses. The senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries engaged in mortgage and reinsurance activities. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and expenses, were approximately $295 million. At November 30, 2001, the carrying amount of the senior notes was $301.3 million. In February 1999, we issued $282 million of 7 5/8% senior notes. The senior notes are due in 2009 and were issued for the purpose of reducing amounts outstanding under revolving credit facilities and redeeming outstanding 10 3/4% notes. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting and market discounts, expenses and settlement of a related interest rate hedge agreement, were approximately $266 million. The senior notes are collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries. In March 1999, we redeemed all of the outstanding 10 3/4% senior notes due 2004 of one of our subsidiaries, Greystone Homes, Inc., at a price of 105.375% of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest. Cash paid to redeem the notes was $132 million, which approximated their carrying value. At November 30, 2001, the carrying value of the 7 5/8% senior notes was $271.5 million. In July 1998, we issued, for $229 million, zero coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 (the "Debentures") with a face amount at maturity of $493 million. The Debentures have an effective interest rate of 3 7/8%. The Debentures are convertible at any time into our common stock at the rate of 12.3768 shares per $1,000 face amount at maturity. If the Debentures are converted during the first five years, we may elect to pay cash equal to the fair value of the common stock at the time of the conversion. Holders have the option to require us to repurchase the Debentures on any of the fifth, tenth or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the initial issue price plus accrued original issue discount. We have the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and or shares of our common stock. We have the option to redeem the Debentures, in cash, at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued original issue discount. The Debentures are collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries. At November 30, 2001, the carrying value of outstanding Debentures, net of unamortized original issue discount, was $256.9 million. Our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 29.1% at November 30, 2001, compared to 44.0% at November 30, 2000. The decrease primarily resulted from cash generated by our operations during 2001. In addition to the use of capital in our ordinary homebuilding and financial services activities, we will continue to actively evaluate various other uses of capital which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital requirements. This may include acquisitions of or investments in other entities. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. Our Financial Services Division finances its mortgage loan activities by pledging them as collateral for borrowings under a line of credit totaling $500 million. Borrowings under the financial services line of credit were $483.2 million and $339.4 million at November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001, we sold substantially all of our retained mortgage servicing rights and realized a pretax profit of approximately $13 million. We have various interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately $400 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. The interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2007 and fix the LIBOR index (to which certain of our debt 14 interest rates are tied) at an average interest rate of 6.6% at November 30, 2001. The net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to each of the above agreements are major financial institutions. At November 30, 2001, the fair value of the interest rate swaps, net of tax, was a $19.3 million liability. Our Financial Services Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale or disposition from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. Our 2000 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the "Plan") provides for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when the options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2001, 835,000 shares of restricted stock were outstanding under the Plan. The stock was valued based on its market price on the date of grant. The grants vest over 5 years. Unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense over the period of restrictions and is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets. In June 2001, our Board of Directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 10 million shares of our outstanding common stock. We may repurchase these shares in the open market from time to time. During 2001, we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock. As of November 30, 2000, under prior approvals, we had repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $158.9 million, or $16 per share. We have shelf registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to up to $970 million of equity or debt securities which we may sell for cash and up to $400 million of equity or debt securities which we may issue in connection with acquisitions of companies or interests in them, businesses, or assets. As of November 30, 2001, no securities had been issued under these registration statements. In March 1998, we entered into an equity draw down agreement with a major international banking firm (the "Firm") under which we have the option to sell common stock, up to proceeds of $120 million, to the Firm in increments of up to $15 million (or such higher amount as may be agreed to by the parties) per month. In the event we elect to sell common stock, the sales price is equal to 98% of the average of the daily high and low stock price from time to time. As of November 30, 2001, we had issued 1.1 million shares under the agreement resulting in proceeds to us of $36 million, all of which occurred in fiscal 1998. We believe we maintain excellent relationships with the financial institutions participating in our financing arrangements and have no reason to believe that these relationships will not continue in the future. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth. Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships We frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Through partnerships, we reduce and share our risk and the amount invested in land while increasing access to potential future homesites. The use of partnerships also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners generally are third party homebuilders, land sellers seeking a share of the profits from development of the land or real estate professionals who do not have the capital and or expertise to develop properties by themselves. While we view the use of unconsolidated partnerships as beneficial to our homebuilding activities, we do not view them as essential to those activities. 15 Many of the partnerships in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. At November 30, 2001, we had ownership interests of between 10% to 50% in these unconsolidated partnerships. In many instances, we are appointed as the day to day manager of the partnerships and receive fees for performing this function. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling $26.1 million, $9.7 million, and $6.2 million, respectively, from unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests. We may obtain options or other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated partnerships. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when we receive the options. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, $232.6 million, $134.6 million, and $111.3 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated partnerships revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. At November 30, 2001, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of $1.4 billion and total liabilities of $777.1 million, which included $627.4 million of notes and mortgages payable. In some instances, we and or our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees on certain partnership debt. We provided guarantees totaling $338.7 million of which $151.0 million were limited maintenance guarantees. When we provide guarantees, the partnership generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders. These limited guarantees only apply if the partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the fair value of the collateral (generally land and improvements thereto) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under these guarantees to bring the fair value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase our share of any funds distributed upon the dissolution of the partnership. During 2001, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we were a partner generated $903.3 million of revenues and incurred $761.7 million of expenses, resulting in net earnings of $141.6 million. Our share of those net earnings was $27.1 million. We do not include in our income our pro rata partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships when title passes to a third party homebuyer, which in effect defers recognition of the partnership earnings until we sell the land. At the time of the 1997 transfer of our commercial real estate investment to LNR Property Corporation ("LNR"), and the spin off of LNR to our stockholders, we formed Lennar Land Partners with LNR, a 50% 50% owned unconsolidated partnership, which is included in the above discussion of unconsolidated partnerships. We also have several other unconsolidated partnerships with LNR. In these partnerships, we provide the residential development experience and LNR contributes the commercial property expertise. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, we purchased land from Lennar Land Partners for a total of $104.2 million, $112.3 million and $109.3 million, respectively. We believe the amounts we paid for land purchased from Lennar Land Partners approximates the amounts we would have paid to independent third parties for similar properties. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase (including option contracts), development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to acquire portions of properties when we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2001, we had $180.3 million of primarily non refundable option deposits and advanced costs, with entities including unconsolidated partnerships, which allows us to acquire approximately 31,000 homesites. The minimum aggregate principal maturities of senior notes and other debts payable during the five years subsequent to November 30, 2001 are as follows: 2002 $17.7 million; 2003 $7.3 million; 2004 $22.9 million; 2005 $6.3 million and 2006 $4.0 million. The remaining principal obligations are due subsequent to November 30, 2006. Our debt arrangements contain certain financial covenants with which we were in compliance at November 30, 2001. The minimum aggregate principal maturities of our Financial Services Divisions notes and other debts payable during the five years subsequent to November 30, 2001 are as follows: 2002 $343.5 million and 2003 $350.4 million. 16 We have entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future minimum payments under the noncancelable leases are as follows: 2002 $30.7 million; 2003 $25.2 million; 2004 $20.0 million; 2005 $14.5 million; 2006 $11.4 million and thereafter $24.7 million. We are committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $154.3 million at November 30, 2001. Additionally, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of $750.7 million. We do not believe that any such bonds are likely to be drawn upon. At November 30, 2001, our Financial Services Divisions pipeline of loans in process totaled approximately $1.7 billion. To minimize credit risk, we use the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to our lending activities. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Loans in the pipeline of loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrower totaled approximately $235.0 million as of November 30, 2001. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 30 days or less. Mandatory mortgage backed securities ("MBS") forward commitments are used by the Financial Services Division to hedge our interest rate exposure during the period from when we make an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into agreements with investment bankers with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and current market value. At November 30, 2001, we had open commitments amounting to $291.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2002. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS Despite difficult economic conditions in large portions of the United States during much of 2001, the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply/demand relationship as well as low interest rates. As a result of this favorable environment, our new orders increased by 34% in 2001 (6% giving pro forma effect for all of 2000 for the May 2000 acquisition of U.S. Home Corporation). New orders decreased 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, compared to the same period in 2000, primarily as a result of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, resulting in a lower backlog at November 30, 2001 than at the same date in 2000. BACKLOG Backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. Before entering into sales contracts, we generally prequalify our customers. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home or fail to qualify for financing and under certain other circumstances. We experienced an average cancellation rate of 22% in 2001, compared to 21% and 20% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes, they have not had a material impact on sales, operations or liquidity, because we closely monitor the progress of prospective buyers in obtaining financing and use the information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes. We do not recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. SEASONALITY We have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. We typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings. Because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months, we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half. As a result, our earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of the fiscal year. 17 INTEREST RATES AND CHANGING PRICES Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. In recent years, the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method and requires acquired intangible assets to be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if certain criteria are met. We adopted SFAS No. 141 for all future acquisitions. SFAS No. 142 no longer requires or permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived assets. Instead, these assets must be reviewed annually (or more frequently under certain conditions) for impairment in accordance with this statement. This impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on December 1, 2001. Because of that, amortization of goodwill of approximately $6 million per year will not be incurred in the future. We do not currently believe that the implementation of SFAS No. 142 will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 provides accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 144 is effective for our 2003 fiscal year. We do not currently believe that the implementation of SFAS No. 144 will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations, mortgage loans and mortgage loans held for sale or disposition. We utilize derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risk associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The tables on the following pages provide information at November 30, 2001 and 2000 about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used for purposes that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For mortgage loans held for sale or disposition, mortgage loans and investments and senior notes and other debts payable, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2001 and 2000. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2001 and 2000. For interest rate swaps, the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2001 and 2000. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. Our limited purpose finance subsidiaries have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long term financings. These limited purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral and therefore, they received little more than is required to pay that debt service and are excluded from the following tables. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk. 18 Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2001 Years Ending November 30, Fair Market Value at November 30, 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total 2001 (Dollars in millions) ASSETS Financial Services: Mortgage loans held for sale or disposition, net: Fixed rate............. $ 573.9 573.9 574.1 Average interest rate.. 6.9% Variable rate.......... $ 13.8 13.8 13.8 Average interest rate.. 5.9% Mortgage loans and in vestments: Fixed rate............. $ 18.4 4.8 1.2 0.3 5.9 24.2 54.8 54.2 Average interest rate.. 6.9% 9.9% 7.0% 9.2% 9.1% 10.7% LIABILITIES Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate............. $ 17.7 7.3 22.9 6.3 4.0 1,447.1 1,505.3 1,611.5 Average interest rate.. 5.6% 5.0% 7.6% 6.4% 5.7% 6.8% Financial Services: Notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate............. $ Average interest rate..
