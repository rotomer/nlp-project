Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Some of the statements contained in the following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the statements anticipate. Forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, may, can, could, might, guidance, goal, visibility, and other words or phrases of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Factors which may affect our results include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, the market for homes and prices for homes generally and in areas where we have developments, the availability and cost of land suitable for residential development, materials prices, labor costs, interest rates, consumer confidence, competition, terrorist acts or other acts of war, environmental factors and government regulations affecting our operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We achieved record revenues, profits and earnings per share in 2003. Our net earnings in 2003 were $751.4 million, or $4.65 per share diluted, compared to $545.1 million, or $3.51 per share diluted, in 2002. The increase in net earnings was attributable to strong homebuilding gross margins and increased operating earnings from our Financial Services Division. In particular, both our deliveries and average sales price on homes delivered increased due to strong demand resulting from supply constraints, strong demographic trends, low interest rates and improving economic trends. With $1.2 billion of cash at year end, our net homebuilding debt (i.e., homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash) to total net capital (i.e., net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity) ratio was 9.7% at November 30, 2003, compared to 27.7% last year. Additionally, we had zero outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facilities at year end. Our record earnings combined with a strong balance sheet contributed to a return on net capital of approximately 23% in 2003, compared to approximately 22% in 2002. Earnings per share amounts for all years have been adjusted to reflect the effect of our April 2003 10% Class B common stock distribution and our January 2004 two for one stock split. Homebuilding Our Homebuilding Division sells and constructs homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers. We use a dual marketing strategy in which we sell homes under both our Everythings Included&reg; and Design StudioSM programs. Our land operations include the purchase, development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities, as well as the sale of land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risk by forming partnerships with other entities. The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information for the years indicated. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years are included in the information since the respective dates of the acquisitions. 12 Selected Homebuilding Division Financial Data Years Ended November 30, 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands, except average sales price) Revenues: Sales of homes $ 8,040,470 6,581,703 5,467,548 Sales of land 308,175 169,598 87,199 Total revenues 8,348,645 6,751,301 5,554,747 Costs and expenses: Cost of homes sold 6,180,777 5,119,668 4,275,321 Cost of land sold 234,844 167,640 85,546 Selling, general and administrative 872,735 705,901 573,204 Total costs and expenses 7,288,356 5,993,209 4,934,071 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships 81,937 42,651 27,051 Management fees and other income, net 21,863 33,313 18,396 Operating earnings $ 1,164,089 834,056 666,123 Gross margin on home sales 23.1 % 22.2 % 21.8 % SG&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales 10.9 % 10.7 % 10.5 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales 12.3 % 11.5 % 11.3 % Average sales price $ 256,000 245,000 237,000 Prior year amounts contain reclassifications to conform to the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on reported net earnings. Homebuilding results reflect reclassifications that have been made to interest expense (now included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold), equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net. 13 Summary of Home and Backlog Data By Region At or for the Years Ended November 30, 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Deliveries East 10,348 9,296 8,175 Central 9,993 7,766 7,056 West 11,839 10,331 8,668 Total 32,180 27,393 23,899 Of the deliveries listed above, 768, 568 and 795 deliveries relate to unconsolidated partnerships for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. New Orders East 11,640 10,192 8,445 Central 9,696 7,591 7,180 West 12,187 10,590 8,250 Total 33,523 28,373 23,875 Of the new orders listed above, 1,553, 733 and 833 new orders relate to unconsolidated partnerships for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Backlog Homes East 6,121 4,780 3,314 Central 2,416 2,713 1,977 West 5,368 4,615 3,048 Total 13,905 12,108 8,339 Of the homes in backlog listed above, 1,226, 441 and 255 homes in backlog relate to unconsolidated partnerships at November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Backlog Dollar Value (including unconsolidated partnerships) $ 3,887,000 3,200,000 1,982,000 At November 30, 2003, our market regions consisted of homebuilding divisions in the following states: East: Florida, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina. Central: Texas, Illinois and Minnesota. West: California, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada. During 2003, we expanded our operations in California and South Carolina through homebuilding acquisitions. During 2002, we acquired nine homebuilders, which expanded our operations into the Carolinas and the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley, California homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. Revenues from sales of homes increased 22% in 2003 and 20% in 2002, compared to the previous years as a result of a 17% increase and a 16% increase in the number of home deliveries, respectively, in 2003 and 2002, and a 4% increase in the average sales price in both years. In 2003, new home deliveries were higher in most of our markets, primarily in California, Florida, Texas and Illinois. In 2002, new home deliveries were higher primarily due to a strong homebuilding market, combined with our acquisitions during the year. The average sales price of homes delivered increased in 2003 and 2002 primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets, combined with changes in our product and geographic mix. Gross margin percentages on home sales were 23.1%, 22.2% and 21.8% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 was due to a greater contribution from a strong California market, combined 14 with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow. The increase in 2002 was due to improved operational efficiencies and strength in the homebuilding markets in which we operated, partially offset by softness primarily in the Texas market. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 10.9% in 2003, compared to 10.7% and 10.5% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses, compared to 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to an increase in insurance costs, compared to 2001. Gross profits on land sales totaled $73.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to $2.0 million in 2002 and $1.7 million in 2001. Profits in 2003 were positively impacted by each of our regions, with strong contributions from our East and West regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was $81.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to $42.7 million in 2002 and $27.1 million in 2001. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $21.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to $33.3 million in 2002 and $18.4 million in 2001. Land sales, equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships, and management fees and other income, net, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions by us and our unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, we owned approximately 74,000 homesites and had access to an additional 135,000 homesites through either option contracts or our unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, approximately 15% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 13,905 homes ($3.9 billion) at November 30, 2003, compared to 12,108 homes ($3.2 billion) at November 30, 2002. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of active communities, which resulted in higher new orders in 2003, compared to 2002. As a result of these acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories increased 13% during 2003, while revenues from sales of homes increased 22% for the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to prior year. Financial Services Our Financial Services Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others. The Division sells the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market. The Division also provides high speed Internet access, cable television and alarm installation and monitoring services to residents of our communities and others. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services Division. The results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the information since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 558,974 484,219 425,354 Costs and expenses 404,521 356,608 336,223 Operating earnings $ 154,453 127,611 89,131 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 7,603,000 6,132,000 5,226,000 Number of mortgages originated 41,000 34,100 30,600 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 72 % 80 % 79 % Number of title closing transactions (excluding title policies issued) 245,000 189,000 162,000 Number of title policies issued 175,000 146,000 111,000 Operating earnings from our Financial Services Division increased to $154.5 million in 2003, compared to $127.6 million and $89.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to improved results from our mortgage and title operations, which benefited from low interest rates and a strong refinance and housing environment. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to improved results from our 15 mortgage and title operations, which benefited from a low interest rate and strong housing environment in 2002. The operating earnings in 2002 included a $5.0 million gain on the sale of a cable system. The Divisions mortgage capture rate (i.e., mortgage capture rate is the percentage of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services for the entire year) decreased in the year ended November 30, 2003 due to the transitioning of the mortgage business related to the homebuilders we have acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2002 as well as increasing competitiveness in the mortgage market. Corporate General and Administrative Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in 2003 compared to 1.2% in 2002 and 1.3% in 2001. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At November 30, 2003, we had cash of $1.2 billion, compared to $731.2 million at the end of fiscal 2002. The increase in cash was primarily due to an increase in net earnings partially offset by an increase in inventories as we position ourselves for future growth. In connection with the acquisition of The Newhall Land and Farming Company by an entity jointly owned with LNR Property Corporation (LNR), we contributed approximately $200 million to fund a portion of the purchase price. The majority of this commitment was funded subsequent to year end. Operating Cash Flow Activity During 2003 and 2002, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $580.8 million and $204.6 million, respectively. During 2003, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings and a decrease in loans held for sale offset in part by an increase in operating assets to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities. In particular, inventories at November 30, 2003 had increased by $267.2 million since November 30, 2002, due to an increase in backlog and the expansion of operations in our market areas. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities. During 2002, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings offset in part by increased levels of operating assets to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities as we continued to grow. Cash flows provided by operating activities were lower in 2001 due to an increase in financial services loans held for sale of $211.1 million and $57.1 million in receivables. We sell the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market, generally within 45 days of the closing of the loans. The cash related to these loans and receivables was primarily received in December 2001 and was used to pay down our warehouse lines of credit. Inventories increased $130.7 million in 2001 as we positioned ourselves for future growth. Investing Cash Flow Activity Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $118.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2003 compared to $365.7 million in 2002, and cash provided by investing activities of $1.9 million in 2001. In 2003, we used $159.4 million of cash for acquisitions and $18.8 million for net additions to operating properties and equipment. This usage of cash was offset by $72.1 million of net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest. In 2002, we used $424.3 million of cash for acquisitions offset by $57.9 million of net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships. In 2001, $10.8 million was provided by the sale of substantially all of our mortgage servicing rights and $5.6 million related to net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest. This generation of cash was offset by $13.1 million of net additions to operating properties and equipment. During 2003, we expanded our presence in California and South Carolina, with our homebuilding acquisitions and we purchased a title company, which expanded our title and closing business into the Chicago market. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, we paid $159.4 million, net of cash acquired. During 2002, we expanded our operations into the Carolinas and the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley, California homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in 16 several of our existing markets through our homebuilding acquisitions. In connection with the 2002 acquisitions, total consideration, including debt of acquired companies, totaled approximately $600 million. The results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. We currently are engaged in discussions regarding possible transactions. However, we have no agreements or understandings regarding any transactions, and it is possible we will not enter into any significant transactions in the near future. In July 2003, we formed a joint venture with LNR named NWHL Investment, LLC (NWHL), and NWHL entered into an agreement to acquire The Newhall Land and Farming Company (Newhall). Newhalls primary business is developing two master planned communities in Los Angeles County, California. The transaction was completed on January 27, 2004. The total purchase consideration, after payments with regard to employee options, was approximately $1 billion. In connection with the transaction, NWHL and another company jointly owned by us and LNR, obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall. The remainder of the bank financing will be available to finance operations of Newhall and other property ownership and development companies that are jointly owned by us and LNR. We and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL to fund a portion of the purchase price. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, LNR purchased income producing properties from Newhall for approximately $217 million and we agreed to purchase 687 homesites and obtained options to purchase 623 homesites from the venture. Financing Cash Flow Activity The following summarizes our senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, 2003 2002 (Dollars in thousands) 3 7/8% zero coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 $ 266,917 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021 261,012 248,138 5.95% senior notes due 2013 344,260 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009 273,593 272,591 9.95% senior notes due 2010 301,995 300,175 Term Loan B due 2008 296,000 391,000 U.S. Home senior notes due through 2009 2,367 9,366 The Fortress Group, Inc. senior notes due 2003 12,575 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 72,990 84,547 $ 1,552,217 1,585,309 Our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total net capital was 9.7% at November 30, 2003, compared to 27.7% at November 30, 2002. The decrease in the ratio primarily resulted from cash generated by our operations during 2003. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services activities, we will continue to actively evaluate various other uses of capital which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital requirements. This may include acquisitions of or investments in other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. Our average debt outstanding was $1.6 billion in both 2003 and 2002 and $1.5 billion in 2001. The average rates for interest incurred were 7.7% in 2003, and 7.6% in both 2002 and 2001. The majority of our short term financing needs are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior secured credit facilities. In May 2003, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities (the Credit Facilities) to provide us with up to $1.3 billion of financing. The Credit Facilities consist of a $712 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2008, a $315 million 364 day revolving credit facility maturing in May 2004 and a $300 million term loan B maturing in December 2008. We may elect to convert borrowings under the 364 day revolving credit facility to a term loan, which would mature in May 2008. The Credit Facilities are collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries and are also guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. At 17 November 30, 2003, $296.0 million was outstanding under the term loan B and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facilities. At November 30, 2003, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $627.9 million. The majority of these letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of our total letters of credit, $341.4 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facilities. In February 2003, we issued $350 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2013 at a price of 98.287%. The senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and expenses, were approximately $342 million. We used $116 million of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and added the remainder to our general working capital. The senior notes were issued under our shelf registration statement. At November 30, 2003, our Financial Services Division had warehouse lines of credit totaling $750 million, which included a $145 million temporary increase that expired in December 2003, to fund its mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the facilities were $714.4 million at November 30, 2003 and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold not yet funded with outstanding principal balances of $742.2 million. The warehouse lines of credit mature in May 2004 ($250 million) and in October 2005 ($500 million), at which time we expect both facilities to be renewed. Additionally, the line of credit maturing in May 2004 includes an incremental $100 million commitment available at each fiscal quarter end. At November 30, 2003, we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $0.6 million. Borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans. We also had a $20 million revolving line of credit with a bank, collateralized by certain assets of the Division and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $19.4 million at November 30, 2003. We have various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately $300 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. The interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2007 and fix the LIBOR index (to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied) at an average interest rate of 6.8% at November 30, 2003. The net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. At November 30, 2003, the fair value of the interest rate swaps, net of tax, was a $21.0 million liability. Our Financial Services Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. Changes in Capital Structure On April 8, 2003, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that eliminated the restrictions on transfer of our Class B common stock and eliminated a difference between the dividends on the common stock (renamed Class A common stock) and the Class B common stock. The only significant remaining difference between the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock is that the Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per share and the Class B common stock entitles holders to ten votes per share. Because stockholders approved the change to the terms of the Class B common stock, we distributed to the holders of record of our stock at the close of business on April 9, 2003, one share of Class B common stock for each ten shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock held at that time. The distribution occurred on April 21, 2003 and our Class B common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Our Class A common stock was already listed on the NYSE. Approximately 13 million shares of Class B common stock (adjusted for the January 2004 two for one stock split) were issued as a result of the stock distribution. Additionally, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue to 300 million shares of Class A common stock and 90 million shares of Class B common stock. However, we have committed to Institutional Shareholder 18 Services that we will not issue, without a subsequent stockholder vote, shares that would increase the outstanding Class A common stock to more than 170 million shares or increase the outstanding Class B common stock to more than 45 million shares. The principal purpose of the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and the amendments to our certificate of incorporation was to make a greater number of authorized shares available for us to use in acquisitions, to sell in order to raise capital, to issue under stock option or other incentive programs or otherwise to issue. In June 2003, we called our 3 7/8% zero coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 (the Debentures) for redemption. At the option of the holders, the Debentures could have been converted into Class A common stock at any time prior to the redemption date. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Debentures was convertible into 27.4814 shares of Class A common stock (inclusive of the adjustment for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two for one stock split), which equated to a redemption price of approximately $20.46 per share of Class A common stock. In 2003, substantially all of the Debentures were converted into approximately 13.6 million shares of Class A common stock (adjusted for the January 2004 two for one stock split). In December 2003, our Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock for stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20, 2004. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity. Share and per share data (except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value) for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Our 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) provides for the granting of Class A and Class B stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 2003 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2003, the 2003 Plan had no shares of restricted stock outstanding. In June 2001, our Board of Directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding Class A common stock (adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split). During 2003, we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock in the open market under these authorizations. In prior years under prior approvals, we had repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares (not adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split) of our outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $158.9 million, or $16 per share. In December 2003, we granted approximately 2.4 million stock options (adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split) to our employees under the 2003 Plan and in January 2004, repurchased a similar amount of shares of our outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $109.6 million, or $45.64 per share (adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split). In September 2003, our Board of Directors voted to increase the rate at which dividends are paid with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.50 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.025 per share per year (both adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split). Additionally, our Board of Directors voted to retire our Class A common stock held in treasury. In recent years, we have sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets, and at year end, we had effective Securities Act registration statements under which we could sell to the public up to $620 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or other securities and could issue up to $400 million of equity or debt securities in connection with acquisitions of companies, businesses or assets. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth. 19 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships We frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Through partnerships, we reduce and share our risk and also reduce the amount invested in land, while increasing access to potential future homesites. The use of partnerships also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners in these partnerships generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. While we view the use of unconsolidated partnerships as beneficial to our homebuilding activities, we do not view them as essential to those activities. Most of the partnerships in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. At November 30, 2003, we had ownership interests in these unconsolidated partnerships that did not exceed 50%. In many instances, we are appointed as the day to day manager of the partnerships and receive fees for performing this function. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling $39.0 million, $29.2 million and $26.1 million, respectively, from unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests. We and or our partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated partnerships. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when we receive the options. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, $460.5 million, $419.3 million and $232.6 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated partnerships revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. At November 30, 2003, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of $2.1 billion and total liabilities of $1.2 billion, which included $901.8 million of notes and mortgages payable. In some instances, we and or our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees on certain partnership debt. At November 30, 2003, we had recourse guarantees of $88.7 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $111.6 million of the unconsolidated partnerships debts. When we and or our partners provide guarantees, the partnership generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if a partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the carrying value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the carrying value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated partnership distributes. During 2003, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we were a partner generated $1.3 billion of revenues and incurred $939.0 million of expenses, resulting in net earnings of $375.7 million. Our share of those net earnings was $81.9 million. We do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer. In November 2003, we and LNR each contributed our 50% interests in certain of our jointly owned unconsolidated partnerships that had significant assets to a new limited liability company named LandSource Communities Development LLC (LandSource), in exchange for 50% interests in LandSource. In addition, in July 2003, we and LNR formed, and obtained 50% interests in, NWHL, which agreed to purchase, and in January 2004 completed the purchase, of The Newhall Land and Farming Company, for a total of approximately $1 billion. We and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL to fund a portion of the purchase price, and LandSource and NWHL jointly obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall (the remainder of the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of income producing properties from Newhall to LNR for $217 million). We are not obligated with regard to the borrowings by LandSource and NWHL, except that we and LNR have made limited maintenance guarantees and have committed to complete any property development commitments in the event of default. The combined assets and liabilities of LandSource and NWHL at November 30, 2003 were $380.7 million and $122.3 million, respectively. Our combined investment in LandSource and NWHL was $128.8 million at November 30, 2003. 20 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2003: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Lessthan 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years Over 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 1,552,217 21,523 64,158 8,000 1,458,536 Financial Services Notes and other debts payable (including limited purpose finance subsidiaries) 740,469 734,532 108 17 5,812 Operating leases 192,710 48,022 69,199 40,608 34,881 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,485,396 804,077 133,465 48,625 1,499,229 We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated partnerships until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2003, we had access to acquire approximately 135,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, we had $220.6 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs on real estate related to certain of these homesites. We are committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $627.9 million at November 30, 2003. Additionally, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of $1.0 billion. We do not believe that draws upon these bonds, if any, will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Financial Services Divisions commitments regarding loans in process totaled approximately $2.6 billion at November 30, 2003. To minimize credit risk, we use the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to our lending activities. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $330.7 million as of November 30, 2003. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Our Financial Services Division uses mandatory mortgage backed securities forward commitments (MBS) to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it makes an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and current market value. At November 30, 2003, we had open commitments amounting to $512.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2004. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS During 2003, the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply/demand relationship as well as low interest rates. As a result of this favorable environment, as well as our recent homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of our active communities, our new orders increased by 18% in 2003. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years. This has led some people to assert that the prices of homes and the stocks of homebuilding companies are overvalued and will decline rapidly when the market for new homes begins to weaken. A decline in prices of stocks of homebuilding companies would make it more expensive, and could make it more difficult, for us to raise funds through stock issuances. 21 MARKET AND FINANCING RISK We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities. We also buy land under option agreements, which enable us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings is managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process, and limitation of risk by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option arrangements. BACKLOG Backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. Before entering into sales contracts, we generally prequalify our customers. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home or fail to qualify for financing and under certain other circumstances. We experienced an average cancellation rate of 20% in 2003, compared to 21% and 22% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes, they have not had a material impact on sales, operations or liquidity, because we closely monitor our prospective buyers ability to obtain financing and use the information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes. We do not recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. SEASONALITY We have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. We typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year, although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings. Because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months, we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half. As a result, our earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of the fiscal year. INTEREST RATES AND CHANGING PRICES Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. In recent years, the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Our discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on our financial statements is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. 22 Homebuilding Division Revenue Recognition Sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Additionally, sales of other real estate (including sales of land and operating properties) are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is assured. We do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost, unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. We evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset. We believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change because of the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets as well as our net earnings could be material. Our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years. While no impairment existed as of November 30, 2003, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to impairment of inventory. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2003, the reserve for warranty costs was $116.6 million. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships We frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. 23 Most of the partnerships through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting, because we are not the primary beneficiary for partnerships created after January 31, 2003, as defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the partnerships. We record the investments in these partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships and our share of the partnerships earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as Equity in Earnings from Unconsolidated Partnerships, as described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Advances to these partnerships are included in the investment amount. Management uses its judgment when determining the primary beneficiary of, or a controlling interest in, a partnership. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. Due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or only significant influence, the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy. As of November 30, 2003, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated partnerships where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2003, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of $2.1 billion and total liabilities of $1.2 billion. Financial Services Division Revenue Recognition Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and delivered to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policy. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. In all circumstances, we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Allowances for Loss Reserves We provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans or portions of them are not likely to be collected. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2003, the allowance for loan losses was $3.0 million. While we believe that the 2003 year end allowance was adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans on a non recourse basis within 45 days after we originate them, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs. At November 30, 2003, we also had an allowance for title and escrow losses of $0.6 million related to certain assets. These allowances require managements judgments and estimates. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimates related to the allowances for loss reserves are critical accounting estimates. Homebuilding and Financial Services Divisions Goodwill Valuation Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The process of determining goodwill requires judgment. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and 24 estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For those reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. During fiscal 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we performed a test for impairment of goodwill as of December 1, 2001, which resulted in no impairment being identified. Goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Instead, we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2003 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. At November 30, 2003, goodwill was $212.7 million (net of accumulated amortization of $18.0 million). While we believe that no impairment existed as of November 30, 2003, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to impairment of goodwill. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the changes are enacted. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates, we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations. At November 30, 2003, our net deferred tax asset was $177.8 million. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations, mortgage loans and mortgage loans held for sale. We utilize derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risk associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The tables on the following pages provide information at November 30, 2003 and 2002 about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage loans and investments, senior notes, notes and other debts payable, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2003 and 2002. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2003 and 2002. Our term loan B is presented as fixed rate debt because our interest rate swaps effectively changed the majority of the debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate. For interest rate swaps, the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest 25 rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2003 and 2002. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. Our limited purpose finance subsidiaries have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long term financings. These limited purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral and are excluded from the following tables. Our trading investments, primarily mutual funds, do not have interest rate sensitivity, and therefore, are also excluded from the following tables. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk. 26 Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2003 Years Ending November 30, Fair MarketValue atNovember 30,2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (Dollars in millions) ASSETS Financial services: Mortgage loans held for sale, net: Fixed rate $ 383.2 383.2 383.2 Average interest rate 6.1 % Variable rate $ 159.3 159.3 159.3 Average interest rate 5.0 % Mortgage loans and investments: Fixed rate $ 30.6 3.8 6.0 0.6 2.0 15.5 58.5 57.4 Average interest rate 1.7 % 4.0 % 10.4 % 23.6 % 10.0 % 9.9 % LIABILITIES Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 21.5 45.7 18.4 4.0 4.0 1,458.6 1,552.2 1,878.8 Average interest rate 4.8 % 7.2 % 11.9 % 2.9 % 2.9 % 6.4 % Financial services: Notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ Average interest rate Variable rate $ 734.5 0.1 0.1 734.7 734.7 Average interest rate 1.8 % 4.9 % 4.9 % OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Homebuilding: Interest rate swaps: Variable to fixed notional amount $ 100.0 200.0 300.0 (33.7 ) Average pay rate 6.7 % 6.8 % Average receive rate LIBOR LIBOR 27 Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2002 Years Ending November 30, Thereafter Total Fair MarketValue atNovember 30,2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 (Dollars in millions) ASSETS Financial services: Mortgage loans held for sale, net: Fixed rate $ 616.6 616.6 616.6 Average interest rate 6.2 % Variable rate $ 91.7 91.7 91.7 Average interest rate 5.2 % Mortgage loans and investments: Fixed rate $ 22.1 6.3 0.3 6.0 0.6 17.4 52.7 52.1 Average interest rate 2.9 % 2.6 % 13.7 % 10.4 % 14.7 % 11.1 % LIABILITIES Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 64.1 19.7 14.6 17.5 379.8 1,089.6 1,585.3 1,779.7 Average interest rate 10.1 % 4.3 % 15.2 % 13.0 % 4.0 % 7.1 % Financial services: Notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ Average interest rate Variable rate $ 688.4 165.0 853.4 853.4 Average interest rate 2.3 % 2.3 % OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Homebuilding: Interest rate swaps: Variable to fixed notional amount $ 100.0 200.0 300.0 (39.3 ) Average pay rate 6.7 % 6.8 % Average receive rate LIBOR LIBOR 28
