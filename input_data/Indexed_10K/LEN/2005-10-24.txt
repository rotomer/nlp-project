Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data, included in our original Form 10 K, and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this document. Restatement of Financial Statements The discussion of cash flows in the Financial Condition and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended November 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflects a restatement of $128.5 million, $137.7 million and $77.9 million in our consolidated statements of cash flows, respectively, to reclassify these amounts from cash flows from investing activities to cash flows from operating activities as they relate to distributions of earnings received from unconsolidated entities in which we have investments that are accounted for by the equity method. The restatement does not affect the net change in cash for any of the years ended November 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and has no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of earnings and related earnings per share amounts or consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K/A, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors Relating to Our Business in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for our fiscal year ended November 30, 2004. We do not undertake any obligation or duty to update forward looking statements to reflect either the occurrence or non occurrence of any of the risk factors, or to reflect any other future event or circumstance. 1 Table of Contents Outlook Our backlog dollar value of sales contracts at November 30, 2004 was 30% higher than it was at November 30, 2003. This gives us good visibility as we enter fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, we anticipate demand for our homes to remain strong due to continued strength in the homebuilding market, and we also anticipate growth in the volume of our mid to high rise residential business. In addition, we remain a growth focused company, and we expect to continue to employ a diversified growth strategy to enhance future opportunities for our company. This will entail increasing sales organically and by acquiring small and possibly large homebuilders. We expect this combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions to result in, among other things, cost savings and growth of ancillary services. While we may be negatively impacted by higher interest rates, higher building costs and shortages of certain building materials in the long term, we believe we will be able to leverage our size to offset these market factors, and we will attempt to manage these challenges through process improvement and cost reduction. Also, our strong balance sheet and cash position afford us the opportunity to continue to build on an already strong market share position while we continue to look for opportunities to grow into new markets. Results of Operations Overview We achieved record revenues, profits and earnings per share in 2004. Our net earnings in 2004 were $945.6 million, or $5.70 per share diluted ($6.09 per share basic), compared to $751.4 million, or $4.65 per share diluted ($5.10 per share basic), in 2003. The increase in net earnings was attributable to strength in our Homebuilding Divisions operations. In particular, both our deliveries and average sales price on homes delivered increased due to strong demand resulting from supply constraints, demographic trends, low interest rates and improving economic trends. Earnings per share amounts for all years have been adjusted to reflect the effect of our April 2003 10% Class B common stock distribution and our January 2004 two for one stock split. Homebuilding Our Homebuilding Division sells and constructs homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers. We use a dual marketing strategy in which we sell homes under both our Everythings Included&reg; and Design StudioSM programs. Our land operations include the purchase, development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities, as well as the sale of land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risks by investing in unconsolidated entities with third parties. The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information for the years indicated. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years are included in the tables since the respective dates of the acquisitions. 2 Table of Contents Homebuilding Divisions Selected Financial and Operational Data (Dollars in thousands, except average sales price) Years Ended November 30, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Sales of homes $ 9,559,847 8,040,470 6,581,703 Sales of land 440,785 308,175 169,598 Total revenues 10,000,632 8,348,645 6,751,301 Costs and expenses: Cost of homes sold 7,275,446 6,180,777 5,119,668 Cost of land sold 281,409 234,844 167,640 Selling, general and administrative 1,044,483 872,735 705,901 Total costs and expenses 8,601,338 7,288,356 5,993,209 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 90,739 81,937 42,651 Management fees and other income, net 58,455 21,863 33,313 Operating earnings $ 1,548,488 1,164,089 834,056 Gross margin on home sales 23.9 % 23.1 % 22.2 % SG&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales 10.9 % 10.9 % 10.7 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales 13.0 % 12.3 % 11.5 % Average sales price $ 272,000 256,000 245,000 3 Table of Contents Summary of Home and Backlog Data By Region At November 30, 2004, our market regions consisted of homebuilding divisions located in the following states: East: Florida, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina. Central: Texas, Illinois and Minnesota. West: California, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada.

Backlog Dollar Value (In thousands) East $ 2,177,884 1,526,970 1,177,214 Central 633,703 558,919 566,713 West 2,243,686 1,801,411 1,456,279 Total $ 5,055,273 3,887,300 3,200,206 Of the dollar value of homes in backlog listed above, $644,839, $367,855 and $132,401, respectively, represent the backlog dollar value from unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home, fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 16% in 2004, compared to 20% and 21% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes, they have not had a material impact on sales, operations or liquidity because we closely monitor our prospective buyers ability to obtain financing and use that information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes. We do 4 Table of Contents not recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. During 2004, we expanded our presence through homebuilding acquisitions in all of our regions. During 2003, we expanded our operations in California and South Carolina through homebuilding acquisitions. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. 2004 versus 2003 Revenues from home sales increased 19% in 2004 to $9.6 billion from $8.0 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 12% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 6% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2004. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 35,189 homes in the year ended November 30, 2004 from 31,412 homes last year. In 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of our regions, compared to 2003. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $272,000 in the year ended November 30, 2004 from $256,000 in 2003. Gross margins on home sales were $2.3 billion, or 23.9%, in 2004, compared to $1.9 billion, or 23.1%, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by an improvement in our East and West regions. This improvement was primarily attributable to pricing power, particularly in our land constrained markets, as well as a change in product mix. This improvement was partially offset by warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $134.2 million in 2004, compared to $141.3 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 10.9% in both 2004 and 2003. Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $440.8 million and $159.4 million, or 36.2%, respectively, in 2004, compared to $308.2 million and $73.3 million, or 23.8%, respectively, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by each of our regions, with a strong contribution from our East and West regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $90.7 million in 2004, compared to $81.9 million last year. This improvement resulted from an increase in homes delivered by our unconsolidated homebuilding joint ventures. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $58.5 million in 2004, compared to $21.9 million in 2003. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2004, we owned approximately 88,000 homesites and had access to an additional 168,000 homesites through either option contracts or unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2004, 13% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 15,546 homes ($5.1 billion) at November 30, 2004, compared to 13,905 homes ($3.9 billion) at November 30, 2003. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our growth and strong demand for our homes, which resulted in higher new orders in 2004, compared to 2003. As a result of acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, increased 35% during 2004, while revenues from sales of homes increased 19% for the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to prior year. 2003 versus 2002 Revenues from sales of homes increased 22% in 2003, compared to 2002, as a result of a 17% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 4% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2003. New home deliveries were higher in most of our markets, primarily in California, Florida, Texas and Illinois. The average sales price of homes delivered increased in 2003 primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets, combined with changes in our product and geographic mix. 5 Table of Contents Gross margins on home sales were $1.9 billion or 23.1%, in 2003, compared to $1.5 billion, or 22.2% in 2002. The increase in 2003 was due to a greater contribution from a strong California market, combined with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $141.3 million in 2003, compared to $145.6 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 10.9% in 2003, compared to 10.7% in 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses, compared to 2002. Revenues and gross margins on land sales totaled $308.2 million and $73.3 million, or 23.8%, respectively, in 2003, compared to $169.6 million and $2.0 million, or 1.2%, respectively, in 2002. Margins in 2003 were positively impacted by each of our regions, with strong contributions from our East and West regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $81.9 million in 2003, compared to $42.7 million in 2002. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $21.9 million in 2003, compared to $33.3 million in 2002. Sales of land, equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2003, we owned approximately 74,000 homesites and had access to an additional 135,000 homesites through either option contracts or unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2003, 13% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 13,905 homes ($3.9 billion) at November 30, 2003, compared to 12,108 homes ($3.2 billion) at November 30, 2002. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of active communities, which resulted in higher new orders in 2003, compared to 2002. As a result of these acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, increased 11% during 2003, while revenues from sales of homes increased 22% for the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to 2002. Financial Services Our Financial Services Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance, title and closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others. The Division sells substantially all of the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market. The Division also provides high speed Internet and cable television services to residents of our communities and others. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services Division. The results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the table since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Financial Services Divisions Selected Financial and Operational Data (Dollars in thousands) Years Ended November 30, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 504,267 558,974 484,219 Costs and expenses 391,966 404,521 356,608 Operating earnings $ 112,301 154,453 127,611 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 7,517,000 7,603,000 6,132,000 Number of mortgages originated 38,000 41,000 34,100 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 71 % 72 % 80 % Number of title and closing service transactions 188,000 245,000 189,000 Number of title policies issued 185,000 175,000 146,000 6 Table of Contents 2004 versus 2003 Operating earnings from our Financial Services Division decreased to $112.3 million in 2004, compared to $154.5 million in 2003. The decrease in operating earnings in 2004 was primarily due to a more competitive mortgage environment and a slowdown in refinance activity, which resulted in reduced profitability from our mortgage and title operations. The Divisions mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) was relatively consistent in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to 2003. The decline in operating earnings was partially offset by a $6.5 million gain generated by monetizing the majority of our alarm monitoring contracts. 2003 versus 2002 Operating earnings from our Financial Services Division increased to $154.5 million in 2003, compared to $127.6 million in 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to improved results from our mortgage and title operations, which benefited from low interest rates and a strong refinance and housing environment. The Divisions mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) decreased in the year ended November 30, 2003 due to the transitioning of the mortgage business related to the homebuilders we have acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2002, as well as a result of increased competitiveness in the mortgage market. Corporate General and Administrative Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in both 2004 and 2003 and 1.2% in 2002. Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2004, we had cash related to our homebuilding and financial services operations of $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2003. The increase in cash was primarily due to an increase in our net earnings and proceeds from debt issuances partially offset by an increase in operating assets and contributions to unconsolidated entities as we position ourselves for future growth. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facilities and warehouse lines of credit. Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2004 and 2003, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $401.3 million and $718.5 million, respectively. During 2004, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities, a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities offset in part by an increase in inventories to support a significantly higher backlog and an increase in receivables resulting from land sales. In particular, inventories increased by $870.2 million during 2004 due to an increased number of home starts to support a significantly higher backlog combined with the accelerated takedown of homesites that had been under option. During 2003, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities and a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale offset in part by an increase in inventories to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities. In particular, inventories increased by $267.2 million during 2003 due to an increase in backlog and the expansion of operations in our market areas. 7 Table of Contents Investing Cash Flow Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $566.7 million during 2004, compared to $255.9 million in 2003. In 2004, we used $105.7 million of cash for acquisitions and $751.2 million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities. In particular, we contributed approximately $200 million to an unconsolidated entity to fund the entitys purchase of Newhall. This usage of cash was partially offset by $330.6 million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. In 2003, we used $159.4 million of cash for acquisitions, contributed $235.7 million of cash to unconsolidated entities and used $18.8 million for net additions to operating properties and equipment. This usage of cash was partially offset by $170.1 million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. During 2004, we expanded our presence through homebuilding acquisitions in all of our regions, expanded our mortgage operations in Oregon and Washington and expanded our title and closing business into Minnesota. The results of operations of the companies acquired are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. However, at November 30, 2004, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions. Financing Cash Flow Activities Homebuilding debt to total capital is a financial measure commonly used in the homebuilding industry and is presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. By providing a measure of leverage of our homebuilding operations, management believes that this measure enables readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance. Homebuilding debt to total capital as of November 30, 2004 and 2003 is calculated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 Homebuilding debt $ 2,021,014 1,552,217 Stockholders equity 4,052,972 3,263,774 Total capital $ 6,073,986 4,815,991 Homebuilding debt to total capital 33.3 % 32.2 % The increase in the ratio primarily resulted from our use of cash and increased borrowings to fund inventory purchases and contributions to unconsolidated entities to support future growth. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. The following table summarizes our senior notes and other debts payable: (Dollars in thousands) November 30, 2004 2003 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021 $ 274,623 261,012 5.95% senior notes due 2013 344,717 344,260 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009 274,890 273,593 9.95% senior notes due 2010 304,009 301,995 5.50% senior notes due 2014 247,105 Senior floating rate notes due 2009 300,000 Senior floating rate notes due 2007 200,000 Term loan B 296,000 U.S. Home senior notes 2,367 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 75,670 72,990 $ 2,021,014 1,552,217 8 Table of Contents Our average debt outstanding was $2.0 billion in 2004, compared to $1.6 billion in 2003. The average rates for interest incurred were 6.4% in 2004, compared to 7.7% in 2003. The majority of our short term financing needs are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior unsecured credit facilities (the Credit Facilities). In May 2004, we amended and restated our Credit Facilities to provide us with up to $1.2 billion of financing. The Credit Facilities also include access to an additional $190 million via an accordion feature, under which the Credit Facilities may be increased to $1.4 billion, subject to additional commitments. The Credit Facilities, including $115 million committed in October 2004 under the accordion feature, consist of a $927.9 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2009 and a $397.6 million 364 day revolving credit facility maturing in May 2005. Subsequent to November 30, 2004, we received additional commitments of $70 million under the accordion feature. Prior to the amendment, in March 2004, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the term loan B portion of the Credit Facilities. We may elect to convert borrowings under the 364 day revolving credit facility to a term loan, which would mature in May 2009. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries (which include mortgage and title insurance subsidiaries). Interest rates are LIBOR based, and the margins are set by a pricing grid with thresholds that adjust based on changes in our leverage ratio and the Credit Facilities credit ratings. At November 30, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facilities. At November 30, 2004, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $787.4 million. The majority of these letters of credit is posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or is posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of our total letters of credit outstanding, $251.4 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facilities. In September 2004, we entered into a structured letter of credit facility (the LC Facility) with a financial institution. The purpose of the LC Facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to $200 million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis. In connection with the transaction, the financial institution issued $200 million of their senior notes, which were linked to our performance on the LC Facility. If there is an event of default under the LC Facility, including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit, the financial institution would assign its claim against us, to the extent of the amount due and payable by us under the LC Facility, to its noteholders in lieu of paying principal on their performance linked notes. At November 30, 2004, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $196.4 million under the LC Facility. In March and April 2004, we issued a total of $300 million of senior floating rate notes due 2009 (the Initial Notes), which are callable at par beginning in March 2006. Proceeds from the offerings, after underwriting discount and expenses, were $298.5 million. We used the proceeds to partially prepay the term loan B portion of the Credit Facilities and added the remainder to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. We repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the term loan B with cash from our working capital. Interest on the Initial Notes is three month LIBOR plus 0.75% (3.16% as of November 30, 2004) and is payable quarterly, compared to the term loan B interest of three month LIBOR plus 1.75%. The Initial Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. At November 30, 2004, the carrying value of the Initial Notes was $300.0 million. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries and subsidiaries formed or acquired after October 9, 2001, guaranteed the Initial Notes. The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly and indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The principal reason our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries and subsidiaries formed or acquired after October 9, 2001, guaranteed the Initial Notes is so holders of the Initial Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Initial Notes will remain in effect while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time, however, when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Initial Notes and other notes with similar termination provisions, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Initial Notes will be suspended. Currently, the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing Lennar Corporations principal revolving bank credit lines, $350 million principal amount of senior notes due 2013, $322 million principal amount of 9.95% senior notes due 2010, $282 million principal amount of 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009, $250 million principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 9 Table of Contents 2014 and $200 million principal amount of senior floating rate notes due 2007. However, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the senior notes due 2013, the senior notes due 2014 and the senior floating rate notes due 2007 also will be suspended with regard to any guarantor subsidiary while it is not guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt and the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the senior notes due 2010 will be suspended with regard to any guarantor subsidiary that no longer is guaranteeing any of Lennar Corporations debt. Therefore, if, while the Initial Notes are outstanding, the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under the principal revolving bank credit lines and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Initial Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Initial Notes. If the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Initial Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million. Because it is possible that our banks will permit some or all of the guarantor subsidiaries to stop guaranteeing the revolving credit lines, it is possible that, at some time or times in the future, the Initial Notes will no longer be guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. In the Supplemental Indenture relating to the Initial Notes, we agreed to file by March 31, 2004 a registration statement relating to the guarantees by subsidiaries formed or acquired after October 9, 2001, but we did not do so because of questions regarding what information was required in that registration statement. Instead of filing a registration statement relating solely to the additional guarantees, on June 29, 2004, we filed a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange fully guaranteed senior floating rate notes due 2009, series B (the New Notes) for the Initial Notes. The New Notes would be substantially identical with the Initial Notes, except that the New Notes would be guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries (other than finance company subsidiaries), including subsidiaries formed or acquired by us after October 9, 2001. In December 2004, the registration statement became effective. In January 2005, we exchanged all of the Initial Notes for the New Notes. In August 2004, we sold $250 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2014 at a price of 98.842% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $245.5 million. We used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Interest on the senior notes is due semi annually. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the senior notes. At November 30, 2004, the carrying value of the senior notes was $247.1 million. In August 2004, we also sold $200 million of senior floating rate notes due 2007 in a private placement. The senior floating rate notes are callable at par beginning in February 2006. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $199.3 million. We used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Interest on the senior floating rate notes is three month LIBOR plus 0.50% (2.91% as of November 30, 2004) and is payable quarterly. The senior floating rate notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the senior floating rate notes. At November 30, 2004, the carrying value of the senior floating rate notes was $200.0 million. At November 30, 2004, our Financial Services Division had warehouse lines of credit totaling $950 million, which included a $275 million temporary increase that expired in December 2004, to fund our mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the facilities were $872.8 million at November 30, 2004 and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded with outstanding principal balances of $894.7 million. There are several interest rate pricing options which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2004 was 2.9%. The warehouse lines of credit mature during 2005 at which time we expect the facilities to be renewed. At November 30, 2004, we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $5.2 million. Borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans and had an effective interest rate of 3.2% at November 30, 2004. We also had a $20 million revolving line of credit with a bank that matures in July 2005, at which time the Division expects the line of credit to be renewed. The line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the Division and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $18.9 million and had an effective interest rate of 3.1% at November 30, 2004. 10 Table of Contents We have various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on $300 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. The interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2008 and fix the LIBOR index (to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied) at an average interest rate of 6.8% at November 30, 2004. The net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. At November 30, 2004, the fair market value of the interest rate swaps, net of tax, was a $14.2 million liability. Our Financial Services Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. Changes in Capital Structure In December 2003, our Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock payable to stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20, 2004. All share and per share amounts (except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value) have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split. In June 2001, our Board of Directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20 million shares (adjusted for the January 2004 two for one stock split) of our outstanding Class A common stock. In December 2003, we granted approximately 2.4 million stock options (adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split) to employees under our 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, and in January 2004 we repurchased a similar number of shares of our outstanding Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $109.6 million, or $45.64 per share (adjusted for our January 2004 two for one stock split). As of November 30, 2004, 17.6 million Class A common shares can be repurchased in the future under the program. During December 2004 and January 2005, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million shares of our outstanding Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $105.3 million, or $54.39 per share. Additionally, during the year ended November 30, 2004, we repurchased approximately 91,000 Class A common shares related to the vesting of restricted stock and distributions of common stock from our deferred compensation plan. In September 2004, our Board of Directors voted to increase the annual dividend rate with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.55 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.50 per share per year (payable quarterly). Dividend rates reflect our January 2004 two for one stock split. In recent years, we have sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets, and at year end, we had shelf registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which we could sell to the public up to $320 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or other securities and could issue up to $400 million of equity or debt securities in connection with acquisitions of companies, businesses or assets. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Through these entities, we reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while increasing access to potential future homesites. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners in these entities generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. While we view the use of these entities as beneficial to our homebuilding activities, we do not view them as essential to those activities. 11 Table of Contents Most of the entities in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. At November 30, 2004, we had ownership interests in these unconsolidated entities that did not exceed 50%. During 2004, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments generated $1.6 billion of revenues and incurred $1.2 billion of expenses, resulting in net earnings of $441.8 million. Our share of those net earnings was $90.7 million. In many instances, we are appointed as the day to day manager of these entities and receive fees for performing this function. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling $40.6 million, $39.0 million and $29.2 million, respectively, from unconsolidated entities in which we had investments. We and or our partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair market value when we receive the options. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, $547.6 million, $460.5 million and $419.3 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. We do not include in our equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer. At November 30, 2004, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $4.2 billion and total liabilities of $2.4 billion, which included $1.9 billion of notes and mortgages payable. In some instances, we and or our partners have provided guarantees on debt of certain unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. At November 30, 2004, we had repayment guarantees of $161.3 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $319.3 million of the unconsolidated entity debt ($200.0 million of the limited maintenance guarantees related to the unconsolidated entity that acquired Newhall). When we and or our partners provide guarantees, the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if an unconsolidated entity defaults on its loan arrangements and the value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds it distributes. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2004: (In thousands) Total Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years Over 5 years Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 2,021,014 60,821 214,739 575,000 1,170,454 Financial services Notes and other debts payable (including limited purpose finance subsidiaries) 900,340 896,896 38 3,406 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt 642,966 118,463 205,869 172,302 146,332 Operating leases 227,975 63,539 87,393 49,839 27,204 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,792,295 1,139,719 508,039 797,141 1,347,396 We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At November 30, 2004, we had access to acquire approximately 168,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2004, we had $222.4 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these homesites. 12 Table of Contents We are committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $787.4 million at November 30, 2004. Additionally, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of $1.3 billion. We do not believe that draws upon these bonds, if any, will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Financial Services Division had a pipeline of loans in process totaling approximately $3.1 billion at November 30, 2004. To minimize credit risk, we use the same credit policies in the approval of our commitments as are applied to our lending activities. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $519.9 million as of November 30, 2004. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Financial Services Division uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments and MBS option contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair market value. At November 30, 2004, we had open commitments amounting to $273.6 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2005. Economic Conditions During 2004, the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply/demand relationship, as well as low interest rates. As a result of this favorable environment and growth in the number of our active communities, our new orders increased by 12% in 2004. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone an economic down cycle in a number of years. This has led some people to assert that the prices of new homes and the stock prices of homebuilding companies may be inflated and may decline if the demand for new homes weakens. A decline in the prices for new homes could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins. A decline in our stock price could make raising capital through stock issuances more difficult and expensive. Market and Financing Risk We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facilities and warehouse lines of credit. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings are managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. We typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year, although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings. We typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months. As a result, our revenues and operating earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year. 13 Table of Contents Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. In recent years, the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission released SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. SAB No. 105 provides the SEC staff position regarding the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for resale. SAB No. 105 contains specific guidance on the inputs to a valuation recognition model to measure loan commitments accounted for at fair market value. Previous accounting guidance required the commitment to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair market value from its inception through its expiration or funding. SAB No. 105 requires that fair value measurement include only differences between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan commitment and a market interest rate, excluding any expected future cash flows related to the customer relationship or loan servicing. In addition, SAB No. 105 requires the disclosure of both the accounting policy for loan commitments, including the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of loan commitments, and any associated hedging strategies. SAB No. 105 is effective for all loan commitments accounted for as derivatives and entered into subsequent to March 31, 2004. The implementation of SAB No. 105 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. In particular, this Statement would require companies to record compensation expense for all share based payments, such as employee stock options, at fair market value. This Statements effective date is the first quarter of the first fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005 (our fiscal quarter beginning December 1, 2005). We are currently reviewing the effect of this Statement on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is 14 Table of Contents complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost, unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory would be written down to fair market value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. We evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset. We believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change due to the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as our net earnings, could be material. Our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years. While no impairment existed as of November 30, 2004, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to an impairment of inventory. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2004, the reserve for warranty costs was $116.8 million. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We frequently invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as 15 Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as Equity in Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. Management uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2004, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2004, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $4.2 billion and total liabilities of $2.4 billion. Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates of the policies. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. In all circumstances, we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Allowance for Loan Losses We provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans or portions of them are not likely to be collected. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2004, the allowance for loan losses was $1.4 million. While we believe that the 2004 year end allowance was adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market on a non recourse basis within 45 days after we originate them, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher occurence of loan charge offs. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. Homebuilding and Financial Services Operations Goodwill Valuation Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. The process of determining goodwill requires judgment. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair market value of our reporting units. Inherent in such fair market value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it 16 Table of Contents is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For those reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or more frequently under certain conditions) for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2004 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. At November 30, 2004, goodwill was $239.4 million (net of accumulated amortization of $18.0 million). While we believe that no impairment existed as of November 30, 2004, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to an impairment of goodwill. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates, we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations. At November 30, 2004, our net deferred tax asset was $126.8 million. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. Stock Based Compensation With the approval of a committee consisting of members of our Board of Directors, we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only from amounts remaining available for grant that were formally authorized by our common stockholders. We grant approved options with an exercise price not less than the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant. We account for options under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the grants. SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, require us to disclose the effects on net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. In particular, this Statement would require companies to record compensation expense for all share based payments, such as employee stock options, at fair market value. This Statements effective date is the first quarter of the first fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005 (our fiscal quarter beginning December 1, 2005). We are currently reviewing the effect of SFAS No. 123(R) on our consolidated financial statements. 17 Table of Contents We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of share based payment is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in determining the valuation of the stock options granted to employees. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, mortgage loans and mortgage loans held for sale. We utilize derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The tables on the following pages provide information at November 30, 2004 and 2003 about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investments available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage loans and held to maturity investments, senior notes, notes and other debts payable, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2004 and 2003. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2004 and 2003. For interest rate swaps, the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2004 and 2003. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. Our limited purpose finance subsidiaries have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long term financings. These limited purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral and are excluded from the following tables. Our trading investments do not have interest rate sensitivity, and therefore, are also excluded from the following tables. 18 Table of Contents See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk.
