Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this document. Restatement of Notes to Financial Statements The discussion in the Results of Operations section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflects a restatement to contain expanded disclosure of reportable segments in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131. We had historically aggregated our homebuilding operating segments into a single, national reportable segment, but have restated our segment disclosure to include three homebuilding reportable segments for the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (see Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements). The restatement has no impact on our consolidated balance sheets as of November 30, 2005 and 2004, or consolidated statements of earnings and related earnings per share amounts, consolidated statements of cash flows or consolidated statements of stockholders equity for the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K/A, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors Relating to Our Business in Item 1A of this document. We do not undertake any obligation or duty to update forward looking statements. Outlook Fiscal 2005 proved to be a very strong year for Lennar and other large national homebuilders, as the pace of price appreciation on new homes drove record level profit margins in various markets. During fiscal 2005, we accumulated a record level backlog dollar value of new home orders, which at November 30, 2005 was 36% higher than it was at the end of fiscal 2004. With communities in place to meet our delivery goals and a backlog of $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2005, we believe that we are well positioned for fiscal 2006. As we enter fiscal 2006, there have been early indications of a slower sales pace in certain markets in which we operate. While these indicators point to the likelihood that price appreciation in these markets will not continue at the level experienced in fiscal 2005, we believe that in most of these markets, with interest rates reasonably low, employment trends remaining positive and inventory levels only moderately up, our focus on inventory management and excellent land positions should support another record year for our company. Our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity position us well for opportunities, as we focus primarily on growing our company organically. However, we remain opportunistic towards the acquisition of small and possibly large homebuilders. In addition to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing bottom line profitability, we remain focused on achieving strong returns on capital by managing our land portfolio and controlling additional homesites through options and strategic joint ventures. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview We achieved record revenues, profits and earnings per share from continuing operations in 2005. Our net earnings from continuing operations in 2005 were $1.3 billion, or $8.17 per share diluted ($8.65 per share basic), compared to $944.6 million, or $5.70 per share diluted ($6.08 per share basic), in 2004. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations was attributable to strength in our Homebuilding operations. In particular, both our deliveries and average sales price on homes delivered increased due to strong demand and supply constraints in strategic markets, low interest rates and favorable economic and demographic trends. Earnings per share amounts for all years have been adjusted to reflect the effect of our April 2003 10% Class B common stock distribution and our January 2004 two for one stock split. The following table sets forth financial and operational information for the years indicated related to our continuing operations. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years are included in the tables since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, (Dollars in thousands, except average sales price) 2005 2004 2003 Homebuilding revenues: Sales of homes $ 12,711,789 9,559,847 8,040,470 Sales of land 592,810 440,785 308,175 Total homebuilding revenues 13,304,599 10,000,632 8,348,645 Homebuilding costs and expenses: Cost of homes sold 9,410,343 7,275,446 6,180,777 Cost of land sold 391,984 281,409 234,844 Selling, general and administrative 1,375,480 1,044,483 872,735 Total homebuilding costs and expenses 11,177,807 8,601,338 7,288,356 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 133,814 90,739 81,937 Management fees and other income, net 61,515 69,251 26,817 Minority interest expense, net 45,030 10,796 4,954 Homebuilding operating earnings 2,277,091 1,548,488 1,164,089 Financial services revenues 562,372 500,336 556,581 Financial services costs and expenses 457,604 389,605 402,862 Financial services operating earnings 104,768 110,731 153,719 Total operating earnings 2,381,859 1,659,219 1,317,808 Corporate general and administrative expenses 187,257 141,722 111,488 Loss on redemption of 9.95% senior notes 34,908 Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes $ 2,159,694 1,517,497 1,206,320 Gross margin on home sales 26.0 % 23.9 % 23.1 % SG&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales 10.8 % 10.9 % 10.9 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales 15.2 % 13.0 % 12.3 % Average sales price $ 311,000 272,000 256,000 2005 versus 2004 Revenues from home sales increased 33% in 2005 to $12.7 billion from $9.6 billion in 2004. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 16% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 15% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2005. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 40,882 homes in the year ended November 30, 2005 from 35,189 homes last year. In 2005, new home deliveries were higher in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2004. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $311,000 in the year ended November 30, 2005 from $272,000 in 2004. 19 Table of Contents Gross margins on home sales were $3.3 billion, or 26.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $2.3 billion, or 23.9%, in 2004. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 210 basis points primarily due to a product mix favoring our higher margin states, as well as a significant gross margin percentage improvement in Arizona, California and Florida. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $187.2 million in 2005, compared to $134.2 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense was due to higher interest costs resulting from higher debt, as well as increased deliveries during 2005, compared to 2004, due to the growth in our homebuilding operations. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2005 was 33.1%, compared to 33.3% as of November 30, 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 10.8% in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 10.9% in the year ended November 30, 2004. Gross profit on land sales totaled $200.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $159.4 million in 2004. Some of these land sales were from consolidated joint ventures, which resulted in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense, net from these land sales and other activities of the consolidated joint ventures was $45.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $61.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $69.3 million in 2004. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $133.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $90.7 million last year. Sales of land, minority interest expense, net, management fees and other income, net and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services segment were $104.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $110.7 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the segments mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment in 2005, as well as a $6.5 million pretax gain generated from monetizing a majority of the segments alarm monitoring contracts in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by improved profitability from the segments title operations in 2005. The segments mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) was 66% in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 71% 2004. The decrease in the capture rate was a result of a more competitive mortgage environment. During 2005, we sold North American Exchange Company (NAEC), a subsidiary of the Financial Services title company, which generated a $15.8 million pretax gain. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004. At November 30, 2005, we owned approximately 102,700 homesites and had access to an additional 222,100 homesites through either option contracts or unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2005, 14% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 18,565 homes ($6.9 billion) at November 30, 2005, compared to 15,546 homes ($5.1 billion) at November 30, 2004. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our growth and strong demand for our homes, which resulted in higher new orders in 2005, compared to 2004. As a result of acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, increased 54% during 2005, while revenues from sales of homes increased 33% for the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to prior year. 2004 versus 2003 Revenues from home sales increased 19% in 2004 to $9.6 billion from $8.0 billion in 2003. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 12% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 6% increase in the average sales 20 Table of Contents price of homes delivered in 2004. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 35,189 homes in the year ended November 30, 2004 from 31,412 homes in 2003. In 2004, new home deliveries were higher in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2003. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $272,000 in the year ended November 30, 2004 from $256,000 in 2003. Gross margins on home sales were $2.3 billion, or 23.9%, in 2004, compared to $1.9 billion, or 23.1%, in 2003. Margins were positively impacted by an improvement in our Homebuilding East and Homebuilding West segments. This improvement was primarily attributable to favorable pricing conditions, particularly in our land constrained markets, as well as a change in product mix. This improvement was partially offset by warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $134.2 million in 2004, compared to $141.3 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 10.9% in both 2004 and 2003. Gross profit on land sales totaled $159.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to $73.3 million in 2003. Some of these land sales were from consolidated joint ventures, which resulted in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense, net from these land sales and other activities of the consolidated joint ventures was $10.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2004 and 2003. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $69.3 million in 2004, compared to $26.8 million in 2003. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $90.7 million in 2004, compared to $81.9 million in 2003. This improvement resulted from an increase in homes delivered by our unconsolidated homebuilding joint ventures. Sales of land, minority interest expense, net, management fees and other income, net and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating earnings from continuing operations from our Financial Services segment decreased to $110.7 million in 2004, compared to $153.7 million in 2003. The decrease in operating earnings from continuing operations in 2004 was primarily due to a more competitive mortgage environment and a slowdown in refinance activity, which resulted in reduced profitability from our mortgage and title operations. The decline in operating earnings from continuing operations was partially offset by a $6.5 million gain generated by monetizing the majority of our alarm monitoring contracts in 2004. The segments mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) was relatively consistent in the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to 2003. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.3% in both the years ended November 30, 2004 and 2003. At November 30, 2004, we owned approximately 87,700 homesites and had access to an additional 168,300 homesites through either option contracts or unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2004, 13% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 15,546 homes ($5.1 billion) at November 30, 2004, compared to 13,905 homes ($3.9 billion) at November 30, 2003. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our growth and strong demand for our homes, which resulted in higher new orders in 2004, compared to 2003. As a result of acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, increased 35% during 2004, while revenues from sales of homes increased 19% for the year ended November 30, 2004, compared to 2003. Homebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding segments sell and construct homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers. We sell homes under both our Everythings Included&reg; and Design StudioSM programs. Our land 21 Table of Contents operations include the purchase, development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities, as well as the sale of land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risks by investing with third parties in unconsolidated entities. We have grouped our homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central and Homebuilding West. Information about homebuilding activities in states that do not have economic characteristics that are similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other. References in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those reportable segments. At November 30, 2005, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in the following states: East: Florida, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas. West: California and Nevada. Other: Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and South Carolina. The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information related to our homebuilding operations for the years indicated: Selected Financial and Operational Data Years ended November 30, (In thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Homebuilding East: Sales of homes $ 3,430,903 2,647,294 2,311,145 Sales of land 68,080 98,994 70,028 Total Homebuilding East 3,498,983 2,746,288 2,381,173 Homebuilding Central: Sales of homes 3,186,870 2,594,321 2,257,264 Sales of land 188,023 113,632 103,283 Total Homebuilding Central 3,374,893 2,707,953 2,360,547 Homebuilding West: Sales of homes 5,030,190 3,455,703 2,609,081 Sales of land 272,577 201,350 124,461 Total Homebuilding West 5,302,767 3,657,053 2,733,542 Homebuilding Other: Sales of homes 1,063,826 862,529 862,980 Sales of land 64,130 26,809 10,403 Total Homebuilding Other 1,127,956 889,338 873,383 Total Homebuilding Revenues $ 13,304,599 10,000,632 8,348,645 22 Table of Contents Years ended November 30, (In thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Operating Earnings: Homebuilding East: Sales of homes $ 606,825 374,799 278,331 Sales of land 24,112 43,712 21,629 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 2,213 3,997 8,826 Management fees and other income, net 9,014 33,631 14,639 Minority interest expense, net (900 ) (1,399 ) Total Homebuilding East 641,264 454,740 323,425 Homebuilding Central: Sales of homes $ 288,723 170,666 184,009 Sales of land 45,623 38,569 19,889 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 15,103 4,672 1,886 Management fees and other income, net 19,395 2,926 2,285 Minority interest income (expense), net (368 ) 686 (162 ) Total Homebuilding Central 368,476 217,519 207,907 Homebuilding West: Sales of homes $ 983,147 606,390 407,566 Sales of land 132,713 74,677 33,055 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 109,995 82,060 71,655 Management fees and other income, net 32,056 29,078 7,551 Minority interest expense, net (43,762 ) (10,083 ) (4,792 ) Total Homebuilding West 1,214,149 782,122 515,035 Homebuilding Other: Sales of homes $ 47,271 88,063 117,052 Sales of land (1,622 ) 2,418 (1,242 ) Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities 6,503 10 (430 ) Management fees and other income, net 1,050 3,616 2,342 Total Homebuilding Other 53,202 94,107 117,722 Operating Earnings $ 2,277,091 1,548,488 1,164,089 23 Table of Contents Summary of Homebuilding Data At or for the Years Ended November 30, Deliveries 2005 2004 2003 East 11,220 10,438 9,541 Central 15,448 13,126 11,588 West 11,731 9,079 7,579 Other 3,960 3,561 3,472 Total 42,359 36,204 32,180 Of the total home deliveries listed above, 1,477, 1,015 and 768, respectively, represent deliveries from unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Substantially all of the homes currently in backlog are expected to be delivered in fiscal 2006. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home, fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 17% in 2005, compared to 16% and 20% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes, they have not had a material impact on sales, operations or 24 Table of Contents liquidity because we closely monitor our prospective buyers ability to obtain financing and use that information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners, except for our mid to high rise condominiums under construction for which revenue is recognized under percentage of completion accounting. During 2005, we entered metropolitan New York City and the Boston and Reno, Nevada markets and we expanded our presence in all of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other through homebuilding acquisitions. During 2004, we expanded our presence in all of our homebuilding segments through homebuilding acquisitions. During 2003, we expanded our operations in California and South Carolina through homebuilding acquisitions. The results of operations of the acquisitions are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. 2005 versus 2004 Homebuilding East: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales were $976.9 million, or 28.5% in 2005, compared to $669.5 million or 25.3% in 2004.

Gross margins from home sales were $191.0 million, or 22.1% in 2004, compared to $209.1 million or 24.2% in 2003. Gross margins on home sales decreased in 2004 due to lower margins in all of the states in Homebuilding Other. Financial Services Segment Our Financial Services segment provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others. The Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis; however, we remain liable for customary representations and warranties related to loan sales. The Financial Services segment also provides high speed Internet and cable television services to residents of our communities and others. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services segment. The results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the table since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 562,372 500,336 556,581 Costs and expenses 457,604 389,605 402,862 Operating earnings from continuing operations $ 104,768 110,731 153,719 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 9,509,000 7,517,000 7,603,000 Number of mortgages originated 42,300 37,900 41,000 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 66 % 71 % 72 % Number of title and closing service transactions 187,700 187,700 245,600 Number of title policies issued 193,900 185,100 175,000 Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2005, we had cash related to our homebuilding and financial services operations of $1.1 billion, compared to $1.4 billion at November 30, 2004. The decrease in cash was primarily due to an increase in inventories, contributions to unconsolidated entities, repurchases of common stock and acquisitions partially offset by our net earnings, distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities and proceeds from debt issuances as we position ourselves for future growth. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and warehouse lines of credit. Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2005 and 2004, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $323.0 million and $420.2 million, respectively. During 2005, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities and distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities partially offset by an increase in inventories due to an increase in construction in progress to support a significantly higher backlog and land purchases to facilitate future growth, an increase in receivables resulting primarily from land sales and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. 26 Table of Contents During 2004, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities, a decrease in financial services loans held for sale and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities offset in part by an increase in inventories to support a significantly higher backlog and an increase in receivables resulting primarily from land sales. In particular, inventories increased by $870.2 million during 2004 due to an increased number of home starts to support a significantly higher backlog combined with the accelerated takedown of homesites that had been under option. Investing Cash Flow Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.0 billion during 2005, compared to $534.1 million in 2004. In 2005, we used $416.0 million of cash for acquisitions, $919.8 million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities and we had an increase in financial services loans held for investment of $117.4 million. This usage of cash was partially offset by $466.8 million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. In 2004, we used $105.7 million of cash for acquisitions and $751.2 million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities. In particular, we contributed approximately $200 million to an unconsolidated entity to fund the entitys purchase of Newhall. This usage of cash was partially offset by $330.6 million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. During 2005, we entered metropolitan New York City and the Boston and Reno, Nevada markets and we expanded our presence in all of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other through homebuilding acquisitions. The results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. However, at November 30, 2005, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions. Financing Cash Flow Activities Homebuilding debt to total capital is a financial measure commonly used in the homebuilding industry and is presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. By providing a measure of leverage of our homebuilding operations, management believes that this measure enables readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance. Homebuilding debt to total capital as of November 30, 2005 and 2004 is calculated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 Homebuilding debt $ 2,592,772 2,021,014 Stockholders equity 5,251,411 4,052,972 Total capital $ 7,844,183 6,073,986 Homebuilding debt to total capital 33.1 % 33.3 % The ratio at November 30, 2005 was consistent with the ratio in the prior year. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021 $ 157,346 274,623 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009 276,299 274,890 5.125% senior notes due 2010 299,715 9.95% senior notes due 2010 304,009 5.95% senior notes due 2013 345,203 344,717 5.50% senior notes due 2014 247,326 247,105 5.60% senior notes due 2015 502,127 Senior floating rate notes due 2007 200,000 200,000 Senior floating rate notes due 2009 300,000 300,000 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 264,756 75,670 $ 2,592,772 2,021,014 Our average debt outstanding was $3.0 billion in 2005, compared to $2.0 billion in 2004. The average rates for interest incurred were 5.7% in 2005, compared to 6.4% in 2004. Interest incurred for the year ended November 30, 2005 was $172.9 million, compared to $137.9 million in 2004. The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our new unsecured credit facility (the New Facility), which replaced our senior unsecured credit facilities (the Credit Facilities) in June 2005. The New Facility consists of a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2010. The New Facility also includes access to an additional $500 million via an accordion feature, under which the New Facility may be increased to $2.2 billion, subject to additional commitments. We repaid the outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities with borrowings under the New Facility. As of November 30, 2005, the commitment under the New Facilitys revolving credit facility was increased by $40 million via access of the accordion feature, reducing the access to additional commitments under the accordion feature to $460 million as of November 30, 2005. Subsequent to November 30, 2005, we received the remaining additional commitments of $460 million under the accordion feature increasing the New Facility to $2.2 billion. The New Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries (which include mortgage and title insurance subsidiaries). Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are LIBOR based, with margins determined based on changes in our leverage ratio and credit ratings, or an alternate base rate. At November 30, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the New Facility. During the year ended November 30, 2005, the average daily borrowings under the Credit Facilities and the New Facility were $685.4 million. We have a structured letter of credit facility (the LC Facility) with a financial institution. The purpose of the LC Facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to $200 million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis. In connection with the LC Facility, the financial institution issued $200 million of its senior notes, which are linked to our performance on the LC Facility. If there is an event of default under the LC Facility, including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit, the financial institution would assign its claim against us, to the extent of the amount due and payable by us under the LC Facility, to its noteholders in lieu of their principal repayment on their performance linked notes. In June 2005, we entered into a letter of credit facility with a financial institution. The purpose of the letter of credit facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to $150 million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis through the facilitys expiration date of June 2008. At November 30, 2005, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.2 billion, which includes $194.3 million outstanding under the LC Facility and $148.2 million outstanding under the letter of credit facility entered into in June 2005. The majority of these letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our 28 Table of Contents performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of our total letters of credit outstanding, $244.6 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the New Facility. In April 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.60% senior notes due 2015 (the Senior Notes) at a price of 99.771%. Substitute registered notes were subsequently issued. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $297.5 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi annually. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the Senior Notes. In May 2005, we redeemed all of our outstanding 9.95% senior notes due 2010 (the Notes). The redemption price was $337.7 million, or 104.975% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. The redemption of the Notes resulted in a $34.9 million pretax loss. In July 2005, we sold an additional $200 million of Senior Notes at a price of 101.407%. The Senior Notes were the same issue as the Senior Notes we sold in April 2005. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $203.9 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi annually. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the Senior Notes. At November 30, 2005, the carrying value of the Senior Notes sold in April and July 2005 was $502.1 million. In September 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2010 (the New Senior Notes) at a price of 99.905% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $298.2 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the New Senior Notes is due semi annually. The New Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the New Senior Notes. We have agreed to exchange the New Senior Notes for registered notes. The registered notes will have substantially identical terms as the New Senior Notes, except that the registered notes will not include transfer restrictions that are applicable to the New Senior Notes. At November 30, 2005, the carrying value of the New Senior Notes was $299.7 million. In March and April 2004, we issued a total of $300 million of senior floating rate notes due 2009 (the Floating Rate Notes) in a registered offering, which are callable at par beginning in March 2006. Proceeds from the offerings, after underwriting discount and expenses, were $298.5 million. We used the proceeds to partially prepay the term loan B portion of the Credit Facilities and added the remainder to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. We repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the term loan B with cash from our working capital. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is three month LIBOR plus 0.75% (5.17% as of November 30, 2005) and is payable quarterly, compared to the term loan B interest of three month LIBOR plus 1.75%. The Floating Rate Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. At November 30, 2005, the carrying value of the Floating Rate Notes was $300.0 million. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, have guaranteed the Floating Rate Notes. In August 2004, we sold $250 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2014 at a price of 98.842% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $245.5 million. We used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Interest on the senior notes is due semi annually. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the senior notes. At November 30, 2005, the carrying value of the senior notes was $247.3 million. We also sold $200 million of senior floating rate notes due 2007 in a private placement. The senior floating rate notes are callable at par beginning in February 2006. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $199.3 million. We used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Interest on the senior floating rate notes is three month LIBOR plus 0.50% (4.92% as of November 30, 2005) and is payable quarterly. The senior floating rate notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the senior floating rate notes. At November 30, 2005, the carrying value of the senior floating rate notes was $200.0 million. 29 Table of Contents Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, have guaranteed all our Senior Notes and Floating Rate Notes (the Guaranteed Notes). The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly and indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The principal reason our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time, however, when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Currently, the only debt the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing other than the Guaranteed Notes is Lennar Corporations principal revolving bank credit line. Therefore, if, the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under the principal revolving bank credit line and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes. If the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing the revolving credit line totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit line is less than $75 million. Because it is possible that our banks will permit some or all of the guarantor subsidiaries to stop guaranteeing the revolving credit line, it is possible that, at some time or times in the future, the Guaranteed Notes will no longer be guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. At November 30, 2005, our Financial Services segment had warehouse lines of credit totaling $1.3 billion to fund our mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the facilities were $1.2 billion at November 30, 2005 and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded by the investor with outstanding principal balances of $1.3 billion. There are several interest rate pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2005 was 5.1%. The warehouse lines of credit mature in August 2006 ($700 million) and April 2007 ($600 million), at which time we expect the facilities to be renewed. At November 30, 2005, we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $10.7 million. Borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans and had an effective interest rate of 5.0% at November 30, 2005. We also had a $25 million revolving line of credit with a bank that matures in August 2006, at which time the segment expects the line of credit to be renewed. The line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the segment and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $23.6 million and had an effective interest rate of 4.9% at November 30, 2005. We have various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on $200 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. The interest rate swaps mature at various dates through fiscal 2008 and fix the LIBOR index (to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied) at an average interest rate of 6.8% at November 30, 2005. The net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. At November 30, 2005, the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was a $6.7 million liability. Our Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The segment enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. We have met all of our quantifiable debt covenants. There have been no significant changes in liquidity from the balance sheet date to the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, except as noted above related to the remaining additional commitments of $460 million received under the accordion feature increasing the New Facility to $2.2 billion. 30 Table of Contents Changes in Capital Structure In January 2004, we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock. All share and per share amounts (except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value) have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split. In June 2001, our Board of Directors authorized our stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20 million shares (adjusted for the January 2004 two for one stock split) of our outstanding common stock. During 2005, we repurchased a total of 5.1 million shares of our outstanding Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $274.9 million, or $53.38 per share. As of November 30, 2005, 12.4 million shares of our common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program. In addition to the Class A common shares purchased under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 229,000 Class A common shares related to the vesting of restricted stock and distributions of common stock from our deferred compensation plan during the year ended November 30, 2005. In September 2005, our Board of Directors voted to increase the annual dividend rate with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.55 per share per year (payable quarterly). Dividend rates reflect our January 2004 two for one stock split. In recent years, we have sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets, and at year end, we had a shelf registration statement effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which we could sell to the public up to $1.0 billion of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or other securities. At November 30, 2005, we had another shelf registration statement effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which we could issue up to $400 million of equity or debt securities in connection with acquisitions of companies or interests in companies, businesses or assets. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Through these entities, we reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while increasing access to potential future homesites. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners in these entities generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers and financial or other strategic partners. Most of the entities in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. At November 30, 2005, our recorded investment in unconsolidated entities was $1.3 billion and our estimated maximum exposure to loss with regard to unconsolidated entities was our recorded investments in these entities in addition to the exposure under the guarantees discussed below. In many instances, we are appointed as the day to day manager of these entities and receive fees for performing this function. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling $58.6 million, $40.6 million and $39.0 million, respectively, from unconsolidated entities in which we had investments. We and or our partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair market value when we receive the options. During 2005, 31 Table of Contents 2004 and 2003, $431.2 million, $547.6 million and $460.5 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding segments. We do not include in our equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding segments. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a homebuyer. Summarized operating results for unconsolidated entities in which we had investments were as follows: Years Ended November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 2,676,628 1,641,018 1,314,674 Costs and expenses 2,020,470 1,199,243 938,981 Net earnings of unconsolidated entities $ 656,158 441,775 375,693 Our share of net earnings $ 241,631 148,868 148,914 Our share of net earnings recognized 133,814 90,739 81,937 Our share of net earnings deferred $ 107,817 58,129 66,977 Our investment in unconsolidated entities $ 1,282,686 856,422 390,334 Equity of the unconsolidated entities $ 3,334,549 1,795,010 885,722 Our investment % in the unconsolidated entities 38.5 % 47.7 % 44.1 % At November 30, 2005, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $8.8 billion and total liabilities of $5.5 billion, which included $4.5 billion of notes and mortgages payable. In some instances, we and or our partners have provided guarantees of debt of certain unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. At November 30, 2005, we had repayment guarantees of $324.3 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $761.1 million related to unconsolidated entity debt. The fair market value of the repayment guarantees is insignificant. When we and or our partners provide guarantees, the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if an unconsolidated entity defaults on its loan arrangements and the value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds it distributes. At November 30, 2005, there were no assets held as collateral that, upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under a guarantee, we could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts to be paid under a guarantee. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2005: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5years Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 2,592,772 27,631 382,325 930,814 1,252,002 Financial services Notes and other debts payable (including limited purpose finance subsidiaries) 1,270,438 1,269,782 656 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt 768,800 138,135 238,980 167,266 224,419 Operating leases 238,733 77,975 87,424 43,676 29,658 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,870,743 1,513,523 708,729 1,141,756 1,506,735 We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for 32 Table of Contents the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2005, we had access to acquire approximately 222,100 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2005, we had $741.6 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these homesites. We are committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $1.2 billion at November 30, 2005. Additionally, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of $1.8 billion. We do not believe there will be any draws upon these bonds, but if there were any, they would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loans in process totaling approximately $3.7 billion at November 30, 2005. To minimize credit risk, we use the same credit policies in the approval of our commitments as are applied to our lending activities. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $511.7 million as of November 30, 2005. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments and MBS option contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS forward commitments and MBS option contracts only with investment banks with primary dealer status and loan sales transactions with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair market value. At November 30, 2005, we had open commitments amounting to $321.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2006. Economic Conditions During 2005, the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply/demand relationship, as well as low interest rates. As a result of this favorable environment and growth in the number of our active communities, our new orders increased by 15% in 2005. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone an economic down cycle in a number of years. Further, during 2005, home prices rose significantly in many of our markets. This has led some people to assert that the prices of land, new homes and the stock prices of homebuilding companies may be inflated and may decline if the demand for new homes weakens. A decline in the prices for new homes could adversely affect both our revenues and margins. A decline in our stock price could make raising capital through stock issuances more difficult and expensive. Market and Financing Risk We finance our contributions to joint ventures, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and warehouse lines of credit. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings are managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. 33 Table of Contents Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. We typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year, although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings. We typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months. As a result, our revenues and operating earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year. Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. In recent years, the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 1). The American Jobs Creation Act, which was signed into law in October 2004, provides a tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities. When fully phased in, the deduction will be up to 9% of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income. Based on the guidance provided by FSP 109 1, this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return. FSP 109 1 was effective December 21, 2004 and the tax benefit resulting from the new deduction will be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006, which begins December 1, 2005. We are evaluating the impact of this law on our future financial statements and currently estimate the future reduction in our federal income tax rate to be approximately 75 basis points. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. In particular, the statement will require companies to record compensation expense for all share based payments, such as employee stock options, at fair market value. The statements effective date is the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year that begins on or after June 15, 2005 (our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 which begins December 1, 2005). We estimate that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in a charge to net earnings of approximately $0.09 per share diluted for the year ending November 30, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB No. 107). SAB No. 107 provides the SEC staff position regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies. SAB No. 107 also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS No. 154). SFAS No. 154, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in an accounting principle. The statement 34 Table of Contents requires retrospective application of changes in an accounting principle to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2006). The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Effective December 1, 2004, as a result of the determination that we met all applicable requirements under SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, we began to apply the percentage of completion method to our mid to high rise condominiums under construction. In accordance with SFAS No. 66, we record a portion of the value of condominium home contracts as revenue when (1) construction is beyond a preliminary stage, (2) the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a full refund except for non delivery of the home, (3) sufficient homes have already been sold to assure the entire property will not revert to rental property, (4) sales prices are collectible and (5) aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated. Revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method is calculated based upon the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs to complete, and is adjusted for estimated cancellations due to potential customer defaults. The change to the percentage of completion method did not have a material impact on our financial condition as of November 30, 2005, or our results of operations or cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2005. Actual revenues and costs to complete construction in the future could differ from our current estimates. If our estimates of revenues and development costs change, then our revenues, cost of sales and related cumulative profits will be revised in the period that estimates change. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost, unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory would be written down to fair market value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. We evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset. 35 Table of Contents We believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change due to the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as our net earnings, could be material. Our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because historically the residential homebuilding industry has been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years. No material impairment charges were recorded during the years ended November 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003. While no material impairment existed as of November 30, 2005, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to an impairment of inventory. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2005, the reserve for warranty costs was $144.9 million. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We frequently invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers and financial or other strategic partners. Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as Equity in Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. Management uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2005, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2005, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $8.8 billion and total liabilities of $5.5 billion. 36 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates of the policies. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Interest income on loans held for sale is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. In all circumstances, we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Allowance for Loan Losses We provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans or portions of them are not likely to be collected. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2005, the allowance for loan losses was $1.2 million. While we believe that the 2005 year end allowance was adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market on a non recourse basis within 60 days after we originate them, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher occurrence of loan charge offs. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. Homebuilding and Financial Services Operations Goodwill Valuation Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. The process of determining goodwill requires judgment. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair market value of our reporting units. Inherent in such fair market value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For those reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or more frequently under certain conditions) for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2005 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. At November 30, 2005, goodwill was $253.1 million. While we believe that no impairment existed as of November 30, 2005, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to an impairment of goodwill. 37 Table of Contents Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates, we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations. At November 30, 2005, our net deferred tax asset was $111.1 million. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. Stock Based Compensation With the approval of a committee consisting of members of our Board of Directors, from time to time we issue to employees options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only from amounts remaining available for grant that were formally authorized by our common stockholders. We grant approved options with an exercise price not less than the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant. We account for options under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the grants. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, require us to disclose the effects on net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. In particular, the statement will require companies to record compensation expense for all share based payments, such as employee stock options, at fair market value. The statements effective date is the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year that begins on or after June 15, 2005 (our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 beginning December 1, 2005). We estimate that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in a charge to net earnings of approximately $0.09 per share diluted for the year ending November 30, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB No. 107). SAB No. 107 provides the SEC staff position regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies. SAB No. 107 also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of share based payment is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in determining the valuation of the stock options granted to employees. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We utilize derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The table on the following page provides information at November 30, 2005 about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investments available for sale, loans held for sale, loans held for investment and investments held to maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2005. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2005. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2005. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. Our limited purpose finance subsidiaries have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long term financings. These limited purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral and are excluded from the following table. Our trading investments do not have interest rate sensitivity, and therefore, are also excluded from the following table. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk. 39 Table of Contents Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2005 Years Ending November 30, Fair Market Value at November 30, 2005 (Dollars in millions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total ASSETS Homebuilding: Investments available for sale: Fixed rate $ 8.9 8.9 8.9 Average interest rate 7.5 % Financial services: Loans held for sale, net: Fixed rate $ 320.5 320.5 320.5 Average interest rate 6.7 % Variable rate $ 242.0 242.0 242.0 Average interest rate 6.2 % Loans held for investment and investments held to maturity: Fixed rate $ 105.3 52.0 4.3 0.2 0.8 15.1 177.7 175.9 Average interest rate 6.0 % 6.4 % 7.6 % 11.7 % 6.0 % 8.6 % Variable rate $ 0.1 0.1 1.7 1.9 1.5 Average interest rate 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % LIABILITIES Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 27.6 35.3 50.8 297.7 301.6 1,252.0 1,965.0 2,072.9 Average interest rate 3.8 % 6.3 % 4.4 % 7.6 % 5.1 % 5.6 % Variable rate $ 200.0 96.2 300.0 31.6 627.8 628.0 Average interest rate 4.9 % 6.0 % 4.6 % 8.7 % Financial services: Notes and other debts payable: Variable rate $ 1,269.8 1,269.8 1,269.8 Average interest rate 5.1 % OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Homebuilding liabilities: Interest rate swaps: Variable to fixed notional amount $ 130.3 69.7 200.0 6.7 Average pay rate 6.8 % 6.8 % Average receive rate LIBOR LIBOR 40 Table of Contents Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2005. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their updated attestation report which is included herein. As described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, we have restated Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report to report segment information relating to our homebuilding operations on the basis of regions of the country, rather than treating our homebuilding business as a single, national reportable segment. Our management has considered its assessment regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to take account of the restatement, and has concluded that its prior assessment, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2005, is correct. This determination was based upon the fact that management believes that our internal control over financial reporting operated in a manner that provided management with a reasonable basis for their original conclusion with respect to reporting segment information. 41 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2005 of the Company and our report dated February 7, 2006 (August 7, 2006 as to the effects of the restatement discussed in Note 4) expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys restated segment disclosures. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Certified Public Accountants Miami, Florida February 7, 2006 (August 7, 2006 with respect to managements discussion of the restatement of the financial statements in the second paragraph of Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting) 42 Table of Contents
