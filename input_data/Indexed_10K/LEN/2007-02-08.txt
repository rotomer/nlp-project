Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements. Outlook During the second half of 2006, conditions in the homebuilding industry deteriorated and we have not yet seen a recovery as we entered the first quarter of 2007. This market weakness is driven primarily by excess supply as speculators reduce purchases and return homes to the market as well as negative customer sentiment surrounding the general homebuilding market. We are experiencing slower sales (down 3% in 2006) and higher cancellations (29% in 2006) which have impacted most of our markets and, therefore, we are making greater use of sales incentives to generate sales in order to build out our inventory, deliver our backlog and convert inventory into cash. In order to manage under these difficult conditions, we have focused on generating cash flow and maintaining an inventory neutral position, which has created liquidity on our balance sheet. We have also renegotiated the prices at which we have options or agreements to purchase land, to bring them in line with current market prices. In order to generate cash flow, we have priced our inventory to market; however, this has resulted in higher than normal sales incentives, leading to lower gross margins on home sales. As we look ahead to 2007, the strength of our balance sheet, together with our renegotiated land positions that reflect current market conditions, provide the foundation from which we will try to rebuild our margins. Steps we expect to take to improve margins include reducing selling, general and administrative expenses to match current volume and reflect available efficiencies, reducing construction costs by negotiating lower prices, redesigning products to meet current market demand, and building on land at current market prices. We will also continue to carefully match our starts to demand, which we expect will cause deliveries in 2007 to be at least 20% lower than they were in 2006. Results of Operations Overview Our net earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $593.9 million, or $3.69 per diluted share ($3.76 per basic share), compared to $1.3 billion, or $8.17 per diluted share ($8.65 per basic share), in 2005. The decrease in net earnings was attributable to depressed market conditions during 2006 that impacted our Homebuilding segments operations. While our deliveries and average sales price on homes delivered increased, our gross margins decreased due to inventory valuation adjustments during the second half of 2006 and higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers in 2006, compared to 2005. 17 The following table sets forth financial and operational information for the years indicated related to our continuing operations. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years were not material to our consolidated financial statements and are included in the tables since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands, except average sales price) Homebuilding revenues: Sales of homes $ 14,854,874 12,711,789 9,559,847 Sales of land 768,166 592,810 440,785 Total homebuilding revenues 15,623,040 13,304,599 10,000,632 Homebuilding costs and expenses: Cost of homes sold 12,114,433 9,410,343 7,275,446 Cost of land sold 798,165 391,984 281,409 Selling, general and administrative 1,764,967 1,412,917 1,072,912 Total homebuilding costs and expenses 14,677,565 11,215,244 8,629,767 Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities (12,536 ) 133,814 90,739 Management fees and other income, net 66,629 98,952 97,680 Minority interest expense, net 13,415 45,030 10,796 Homebuilding operating earnings 986,153 2,277,091 1,548,488 Financial services revenues 643,622 562,372 500,336 Financial services costs and expenses 493,819 457,604 389,605 Financial services operating earnings 149,803 104,768 110,731 Total operating earnings 1,135,956 2,381,859 1,659,219 Corporate general and administrative expenses 193,307 187,257 141,722 Loss on redemption of 9.95% senior notes 34,908 Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes $ 942,649 2,159,694 1,517,497 Gross margin on home sales 18.4 % 26.0 % 23.9 % SG&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales 11.9 % 11.1 % 11.2 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales 6.6 % 14.9 % 12.7 % Average sales price $ 315,000 311,000 272,000 2006 versus 2005 Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the year ended November 30, 2006 to $14.9 billion from $12.7 billion in 2005. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 15% increase in the number of home deliveries in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 47,032 homes in the year ended November 30, 2006 from 40,882 homes last year. In the year ended November 30, 2006, new home deliveries were higher in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $315,000 in the year ended November 30, 2006 from $311,000 in 2005 despite higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($32,000 per home delivered in 2006, compared to $9,000 per home delivered in 2005). Despite the full year increases, there was a significant slowdown in new home sales throughout the country as the year progressed. As a result, during the fourth quarter of the year, revenues from home sales declined by 14%, new home deliveries declined by 4%, excluding unconsolidated entities, and the average sales price declined by 11%, compared with the same period of the prior year. The decline in average sales price resulted from our use of higher sales incentives. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $3.0 billion, or 20.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $3.3 billion, or 26.0%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation 18 adjustments were $2.7 billion, or 18.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2006 due to $280.5 million of inventory valuation adjustments ($157.0 million, $27.1 million, $79.0 million and $17.4 million, respectively, in our Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other). Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $241.1 million in 2006, compared to $187.2 million in 2005. The increase in interest expense was due to higher interest costs resulting from higher average debt during 2006, as well as increased deliveries during 2006, compared to 2005. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2006 was 31.4%, compared to 33.1% as of November 30, 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 11.9% and 11.1%, respectively, for the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. The 80 basis point increase was primarily due to increases in broker commissions and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Management fees of $37.4 million received during the year ended November 30, 2005 from unconsolidated entities in which we had investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation. Loss on land sales totaled $30.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, net of $152.2 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs ($80.5 million, $2.9 million, $44.0 million and $24.8 million, respectively, in our Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other) related to 24,235 homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase and $69.1 million of inventory valuation adjustments ($24.7 million, $17.3 million and $27.1 million, respectively, in our Homebuilding East and Central segments and Homebuilding Other), compared to gross profit from land sales of $200.8 million in 2005. Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($12.5) million in the year ended November 30, 2006, which included $126.4 million of valuation adjustments ($25.5 million, $92.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, in our Homebuilding East and West segments and Homebuilding Other) to our investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $133.8 million last year. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $66.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $99.0 million in 2005. Minority interest expense, net was $13.4 million and $45.0 million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. Sales of land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services segment were $149.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $104.8 million last year. The increase was primarily due to a $17.7 million pretax gain generated from monetizing the segments personal lines insurance policies, as well as increased profitability from the segments mortgage operations as a result of increased volume and profit per loan. The segments mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) was 66% in both the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to 1.4% in the same period last year. At November 30, 2006, we owned 92,325 homesites and had access to an additional 189,279 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2006, 10% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 11,608 homes ($4.0 billion) at November 30, 2006, compared to 18,565 homes ($6.9 billion) at November 30, 2005. As a result of pricing our homes to market through the use of higher sales incentives, building out our inventory and delivering our backlog in an effort to maintain an inventory neutral position, our backlog declined in 2006. The lower backlog was also attributable to the depressed market conditions during 2006, which resulted in lower new orders in 2006, compared to 2005. At November 30, 2006, our inventory balance was consistent with the balance at November 30, 2005. 19 2005 versus 2004 Revenues from home sales increased 33% in 2005 to $12.7 billion from $9.6 billion in 2004. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 16% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 15% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2005. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 40,882 homes in the year ended November 30, 2005 from 35,189 homes in 2004. In 2005, new home deliveries were higher in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2004. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $311,000 in the year ended November 30, 2005 from $272,000 in 2004. Gross margins on home sales were $3.3 billion, or 26.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $2.3 billion, or 23.9%, in 2004. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased 210 basis points primarily due to a product mix favoring our higher margin states, as well as a significant gross margin percentage improvement in Arizona, California and Florida. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $187.2 million in 2005, compared to $134.2 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense was due to higher interest costs resulting from higher debt, as well as increased deliveries during 2005, compared to 2004, due to the growth in our homebuilding operations. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2005 was 33.1%, compared to 33.3% as of November 30, 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 11.1% in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 11.2% in the year ended November 30, 2004. Management fees of $37.4 million and $28.4 million received during the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from unconsolidated entities in which we had investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation. Gross profit on land sales totaled $200.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $159.4 million in 2004. Some of these land sales were from consolidated joint ventures, which resulted in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense, net from these land sales and other activities of the consolidated joint ventures was $45.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $99.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $97.7 million in 2004. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $133.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $90.7 million in 2004. Sales of land, minority interest expense, net, management fees and other income, net and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services segment were $104.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to $110.7 million in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the segments mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment in 2005, as well as a $6.5 million pretax gain generated from monetizing a majority of the segments alarm monitoring contracts in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by improved profitability from the segments title operations in 2005. The segments mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) was 66% in the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 71% in 2004. The decrease in the capture rate was a result of a more competitive mortgage environment. During 2005, we sold North American Exchange Company (NAEC), a subsidiary of the Financial Services title company, which generated a $15.8 million pretax gain. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004. At November 30, 2005, we owned 102,687 homesites and had access to an additional 222,119 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2005, 14% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 18,565 homes ($6.9 billion) at November 30, 2005, compared to 15,546 homes ($5.1 billion) at November 30, 2004. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our growth and strong demand for our homes, which resulted in higher new orders in 2005, compared to 2004. As a result of acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories increased 53% during 2005, while revenues from sales of homes increased 33% for the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 2004. 20 Homebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers primarily under our Everythings Included&reg; program. Our land operations include the purchase, development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities, as well as the sale of land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures. We have grouped our homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central and Homebuilding West. Information about homebuilding activities in states that do not have economic characteristics that are similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other. References in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those reportable segments. At November 30, 2006, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in the following states: East: Florida, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas. West: California and Nevada. Other: Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and South Carolina. The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information related to our homebuilding operations for the years indicated: Selected Financial and Operational Data Years Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Revenues: East: Sales of homes $ 4,642,582 3,430,903 2,647,294 Sales of land 129,297 68,080 98,994 Total East 4,771,879 3,498,983 2,746,288 Central: Sales of homes 3,545,174 3,186,870 2,594,321 Sales of land 104,047 188,023 113,632 Total Central 3,649,221 3,374,893 2,707,953 West: Sales of homes 5,466,437 5,030,190 3,455,703 Sales of land 503,075 272,577 201,350 Total West 5,969,512 5,302,767 3,657,053 Other: Sales of homes 1,200,681 1,063,826 862,529 Sales of land 31,747 64,130 26,809 Total Other 1,232,428 1,127,956 889,338 Total homebuilding revenues $ 15,623,040 13,304,599 10,000,632 21 Years Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Operating earnings (loss): East: Sales of homes $ 305,397 602,000 365,795 Sales of land (63,729 ) 24,112 43,712 Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities (14,947 ) 2,213 3,997 Management fees and other income, net 14,335 13,839 42,635 Minority interest expense, net (4,402 ) (900 ) (1,399 ) Total East 236,654 641,264 454,740 Central: Sales of homes 191,692 287,113 169,261 Sales of land 5,111 45,623 38,569 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 7,763 15,103 4,672 Management fees and other income, net 10,131 21,005 4,331 Minority interest income (expense), net 689 (368 ) 686 Total Central 215,386 368,476 217,519 West: Sales of homes 532,456 956,470 592,961 Sales of land 84,749 132,713 74,677 Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities (6,449 ) 109,995 82,060 Management fees and other income, net 38,918 58,733 42,507 Minority interest expense, net (9,757 ) (43,762 ) (10,083 ) Total West 639,917 1,214,149 782,122 Other: Sales of homes (54,071 ) 42,946 83,472 Sales of land (56,130 ) (1,622 ) 2,418 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 1,097 6,503 10 Management fees and other income, net 3,245 5,375 8,207 Minority interest income, net 55 Total Other (105,804 ) 53,202 94,107 Total homebuilding operating earnings $ 986,153 2,277,091 1,548,488 22 Summary of Homebuilding Data At or for the Years Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 Deliveries East 14,859 11,220 10,438 Central 17,069 15,448 13,126 West 13,333 11,731 9,079 Other 4,307 3,960 3,561 Total 49,568 42,359 36,204 Of the total home deliveries listed above, 2,536, 1,477 and 1,015, respectively, represent deliveries from unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 29% in 2006, compared to 17% and 16% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2006, our cancellation rate was 33%. Although we experienced a significant increase in our cancellation rate during 2006, we remain focused on reselling these homes, which, in many instances, would include the use of higher sales incentives (discussed below as a percentage of revenues from home sales) to avoid the build up of excess inventory. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners, except for our multi level buildings under construction for which revenue is recognized under percentage of completion accounting. 23 2006 versus 2005 East: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Florida and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and New Jersey. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $1.0 billion, or 22.0%, in 2006, compared to $976.9 million or 28.5% in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (11.4% in 2006, compared to 1.8% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $865.0 million, or 18.6%, in 2006 due to a total of $157.0 million of inventory valuation adjustments in all states. Central: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Arizona and Texas, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Arizona and Colorado. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $631.5 million, or 17.8%, in 2006, compared to $657.7 million, or 20.6%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (9.1% in 2006, compared to 5.3% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $604.4 million, or 17.1%, in 2006 due to $27.1 million of inventory valuation adjustments primarily in Arizona and Colorado. West: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Nevada, due to higher deliveries in Reno. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $1.2 billion, or 22.4%, in 2006, compared to $1.5 billion, or 29.3%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (7.5% in 2006, compared to 1.5% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $1.1 billion, or 20.9%, in 2006 due to a total of $79.0 million of inventory valuation adjustments in all states. Other: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in the Carolinas, Minnesota and New York, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in the Carolinas and New York. Gross margins from home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $143.9 million, or 12.0%, in 2006, compared to $191.8 million, or 18.0%, in 2005. Gross margins on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (7.8% in 2006, compared to 4.7% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $126.5 million, or 10.5%, in 2006 due to $17.4 million of inventory valuation adjustments primarily in Illinois and Minnesota. 2005 versus 2004 East: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales were $976.9 million, or 28.5%, in 2005, compared to $669.5 million, or 25.3%, in 2004. Gross margins on home sales increased in 2005 due primarily to higher margins in Florida. Central: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment, except Texas. Gross margins on home sales were $657.7 million, or 20.6%, in 2005, compared to $488.9 million, or 18.8%, in 2004. Gross margins on home sales increased in 2005 due to higher margins in all of the states in this segment. West: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales were $1.5 billion, or 29.3%, in 2005, compared to $935.0 million, or 27.1%, in 2004. Gross margins on home sales increased in 2005 primarily due to higher margins in California. Other: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in Homebuilding Other, except Illinois, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in Homebuilding Other, except Minnesota. Gross margins from home sales were $191.8 million, or 18.0%, in 2005, compared to $191.0 million, or 22.1%, in 2004. Gross margins on home sales decreased in 2005 due to lower margins in Minnesota and Illinois, partially offset by an increase in the Carolinas. 24 Financial Services Segment We have one Financial Services reportable segment that provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and other ancillary services (including personal lines insurance, high speed Internet and cable television) for both buyers of our homes and others. The Financial Services segment sold substantially all of the loans it originated in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis; however, we remain liable for certain limited representations and warranties related to loan sales. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services segment. The results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the table since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 643,622 562,372 500,336 Costs and expenses 493,819 457,604 389,605 Operating earnings from continuing operations $ 149,803 104,768 110,731 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 10,480,000 9,509,000 7,517,000 Number of mortgages originated 41,800 42,300 37,900 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 66 % 66 % 71 % Number of title and closing service transactions 161,300 187,700 187,700 Number of title policies issued 195,700 193,900 185,100 Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2006, we had cash related to our homebuilding and financial services operations of $778.3 million, compared to $1.1 billion at November 30, 2005. The decrease in cash was primarily due to repayment of debt, a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities, contributions to unconsolidated entities and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by our net earnings, distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities and proceeds from debt issuances. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility, issuances of commercial paper and unsecured, fixed rate notes and borrowings under our warehouse lines of credit. Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2006 and 2005, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $554.7 million and $323.0 million, respectively. During 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities and the change in inventories, including inventory write offs and valuation adjustments, partially offset by the deferred income tax benefit and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities. During 2005, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities and distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities partially offset by an increase in inventories due to an increase in construction in progress to support a significantly higher backlog and land purchases to facilitate future growth, an increase in receivables resulting primarily from land sales and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. Investing Cash Flow Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $406.5 million during 2006, compared to $1.0 billion in 2005. In 2006, we used $33.2 million of cash for acquisitions and $729.3 million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities. This usage of cash was partially offset by $321.6 million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. In 2005, we used $416.0 million of cash for acquisitions and $919.8 million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities. We also had an increase in financial services loans held for investment of $117.4 million. This usage of cash was partially offset by $466.8 million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities. 25 Financing Cash Flow Activities Homebuilding debt to total capital is a financial measure commonly used in the homebuilding industry and is presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. By providing a measure of leverage of our homebuilding operations, management believes that this measure enables readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance. Homebuilding debt to total capital as of November 30, 2006 and 2005 is calculated as follows: 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Homebuilding debt $ 2,613,503 2,592,772 Stockholders equity 5,701,372 5,251,411 Total capital $ 8,314,875 7,844,183 Homebuilding debt to total capital 31.4 % 33.1 % The leverage ratio at November 30, 2006 was lower than the leverage ratio in the prior year as we made greater use of sales incentives to generate sales in order to build out our inventory, deliver our backlog and convert inventory into cash. This intensified focus on generating strong cash flow allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce the leverage of our homebuilding operations. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, issuances of commercial paper and unsecured, fixed rate notes, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. The following table summarizes our homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009 $ 277,830 276,299 5.125% senior notes due 2010 299,766 299,715 5.95% senior notes due 2011 249,415 5.95% senior notes due 2013 345,719 345,203 5.50% senior notes due 2014 247,559 247,326 5.60% senior notes due 2015 501,957 502,127 6.50% senior notes due 2016 249,683 Senior floating rate notes due 2007 200,000 Senior floating rate notes due 2009 300,000 300,000 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021 157,346 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 141,574 264,756 $ 2,613,503 2,592,772 Our average debt outstanding was $4.0 billion in 2006, compared to $3.0 billion in 2005. The average rate for interest incurred was 5.7% in both 2006 and 2005. Interest incurred for the year ended November 30, 2006 was $247.5 million, compared to $172.9 million in 2005. The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations, funds available under our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the New Facility), which replaced our senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility) in July 2006, and issuances of commercial paper and unsecured, fixed rate notes. The New Facility consists of a $2.7 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2011. The New Facility also includes access to an additional $0.5 billion of financing through an accordion feature, subject to additional commitments for a maximum aggregate commitment under the New Facility of $3.2 billion. The New Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries (which include mortgage and title insurance agency subsidiaries). Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are LIBOR based, with margins determined based on changes in our credit ratings, or an alternate base rate, as described 26 in the credit agreement. At November 30, 2006, we had no outstanding balance under the New Facility. During the year ended November 30, 2006, the average daily borrowings under the Credit Facility and the New Facility were $447.4 million. We have a structured letter of credit facility (the LC Facility) with a financial institution. The purpose of the LC Facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to $200 million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis. In connection with the LC Facility, the financial institution issued $200 million of their senior notes, which were linked to our performance on the LC Facility. If there is an event of default under the LC Facility, including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit, the financial institution would assign its claim against us, to the extent of the amount due and payable by us under the LC Facility, to its noteholders in lieu of their principal repayment on their performance linked notes. At November 30, 2006, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.4 billion, which includes $190.8 million outstanding under the LC Facility. The majority of these letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of our total letters of credit outstanding, $496.9 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the New Facility. In November 2006, we called our $200 million senior floating rate notes due 2007 (the Floating Rate Notes). The redemption price was $200.0 million, or 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. In April 2006, substantially all of our outstanding 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021, (the Convertible Notes) were converted by the noteholders into 4.9 million Class A common shares. The Convertible Notes were convertible at a rate of 14.2 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. Convertible Notes not converted by the noteholders were not material and were redeemed by us on April 4, 2006. The redemption price was $468.10 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented the original issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the redemption date. In April 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and $250 million of 6.50% senior notes due 2016 (collectively, the New Senior Notes) at a price of 99.766% and 99.873%, respectively, in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering of the New Senior Notes, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $248.7 million and $248.9 million, respectively. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the New Senior Notes is due semi annually. The New Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, and substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guarantee the New Senior Notes. In October 2006, we completed an exchange offer of the New Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Exchange Notes), with substantially all of the New Senior Notes being exchanged for the Exchange Notes. At November 30, 2006, the carrying value of the Exchange Notes was $499.1 million. In March 2006, we initiated a commercial paper program (the Program) under which we may, from time to time, issue short term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion. This Program has allowed us to obtain more favorable short term borrowing rates than we would obtain otherwise. The Program is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Issuances under the Program are guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are also guarantors of our New Facility. The average daily borrowings under the Program from its inception through November 30, 2006 were $553.3 million. We also have an arrangement with a financial institution whereby we can enter into short term, unsecured, fixed rate notes from time to time. During the year ended November 30, 2006, the average daily borrowings under these notes were $379.0 million. In September 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2010 (the 5.125% Senior Notes) at a price of 99.905% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $298.2 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is due semi annually. The 5.125% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the 5.125% Senior Notes. In 2006, we exchanged the 5.125% Senior Notes for registered notes. The registered notes have substantially identical terms as the 5.125% Senior Notes, except that the registered notes do not include transfer restrictions that are applicable to the 5.125% Senior Notes. At November 30, 2006, the carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes was $299.8 million. 27 In July 2005, we sold $200 million of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2015 (the Senior Notes) at a price of 101.407%. The Senior Notes were the same issue as the Senior Notes we sold in April 2005. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $203.9 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi annually. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the Senior Notes. At November 30, 2006, the carrying value of the Senior Notes sold in April and July 2005 was $502.0 million. In May 2005, we redeemed all of our outstanding 9.95% senior notes due 2010 (the Notes). The redemption price was $337.7 million, or 104.975% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. The redemption of the Notes resulted in a $34.9 million pretax loss. In April 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2015 (the Senior Notes) at a price of 99.771%. Substitute registered notes were subsequently issued for the April and July 2005 Senior Notes. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $297.5 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi annually. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the Senior Notes. Substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, have guaranteed all our Senior Notes and Floating Rate Notes (the Guaranteed Notes). The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly and indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The principal reason our subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time, however, when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Currently, the only debt the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing other than the Guaranteed Notes is Lennar Corporations principal revolving bank credit line (currently the New Facility) and our Commercial Paper Program. Therefore, if, the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under the principal revolving bank credit line and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes. If the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing the revolving credit line totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit line is less than $75 million. Because it is possible that our banks will permit some or all of the guarantor subsidiaries to stop guaranteeing our revolving credit line, it is possible that, at some time or times in the future, the Guaranteed Notes will no longer be guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. At November 30, 2006, our Financial Services segment had warehouse lines of credit totaling $1.4 billion to fund our mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the lines of credit were $1.1 billion at November 30, 2006 and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded by the investor with outstanding principal balances of $1.3 billion. There are several interest rate pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2006 was 6.1%. The warehouse lines of credit mature in September 2007 ($700 million) and in April 2008 ($670 million), at which time we expect the facilities to be renewed. At November 30, 2006, we had advances under a conduit funding agreement amounting to $1.7 million, which had an effective interest rate of 6.2% at November 30, 2006. We also had a $25 million revolving line of credit that matures in May 2007, at which time we expect the line of credit to be renewed. The line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the Financial Services segment and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $23.7 million at November 30, 2006 and had an effective interest rate of 6.3% at November 30, 2006. We have various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on $200 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. The interest rate swaps mature at various dates through fiscal 2008 and fix the LIBOR index (to which certain of our debt interest rates 28 are tied) at an average interest rate of 6.8% at November 30, 2006. The net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. At November 30, 2006, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $2.1 million liability. Our Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Financial Services segment enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. We have met all of our quantifiable debt covenants. There have been no significant changes in our liquidity from the balance sheet date to the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in Capital Structure In June 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to permit the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During 2006, we repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price including commissions of $320.1 million, or $51.59 per share. During 2005, we repurchased a total of 5.1 million shares of our Class A common stock under the stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price including commissions of $274.9 million, or $53.38 per share. As of November 30, 2006, 6.2 million shares of common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program. In addition to the common shares purchased under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million Class A common shares during the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the vesting of restricted stock and distribution of common stock from our deferred compensation plan. In 2006, our annual dividend rate with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock was $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly). In September 2005, our Board of Directors voted to increase the annual dividend rate with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.55 per share per year (payable quarterly). Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Through these entities, we primarily seek to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while increasing access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners in these joint ventures (JVs) are land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. JVs with land owners/developers give us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partner. JVs with other homebuilders provide us with the ability to bid jointly with our partner for large land parcels. JVs with financial partners allow us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. JVs with strategic partners allow us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Although the strategic purposes of our JVs and the nature of our JV partners vary, the JVs are generally designed to acquire, develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time. The JVs are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each JV is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other JV participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the JV. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. The capital contributions usually coincide in time with the acquisition of properties by the JV. Additionally, most JVs obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The JV agreements usually permit, but do not require, the JVs to make additional capital calls in the future. 29 Our investment in unconsolidated entities has grown in recent years primarily due to (1) our participation in a larger number of ventures in order to increase the number of homesites controlled while minimizing capital requirements and mitigating market risk and (2) the increase in land prices in recent years. At November 30, 2006, we had equity investments in approximately 260 unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities are generally land development ventures and homebuilding ventures, most of which are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Our investments in unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows: November 30, 2006 2005 (In thousands) Land development $ 1,163,671 1,082,101 Homebuilding 283,507 200,585 Total investment $ 1,447,178 1,282,686 During 2006, we experienced a slowdown in demand for homes in many markets and we increased sales incentives to maintain sales volumes. Primarily as a result of these market conditions, we recorded $126.4 million of valuation adjustments to our investment in unconsolidated entities for the year ended November 30, 2006. After the valuation adjustments, as of November 30, 2006, we believe that our investment in JVs is fully recoverable and it is unlikely that we will be called to perform on any of our guarantees that would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor our investments and the recoverability of assets owned by the JVs. Under the terms of our JV agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some JV agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the JV exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Our equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of JVs earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the JVs. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the JVs earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyer. In some instances, we are designated as the manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option contracts to acquire properties from our JVs generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts generally require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits generally approximate 10% of the exercise price. We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated JVs and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. JVs in which we have investments are subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of JVs in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those JVs not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. As of November 30, 2006, substantially all of our unconsolidated JVs were in compliance with their debt covenants in all material respects. Our arrangements with JVs generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the JVs do business. As discussed above, the JVs in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities. In many instances, the debt financing is non recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guarantees. Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated JVs primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The JVs generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the JV participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage 30 them. Some JVs also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other JV participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes. The JVs often enter into option agreements with buyers, which may include us or other JV participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the JVs as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated JVs generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements. As described above, the liquidity needs of JVs in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the JVs members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a JV to distribute at any given time is a function of the scope of the JVs activities and the stage in the JVs life cycle. We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our JVs. For purposes of classifying distributions received from JVs in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of accumulated earnings. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital. Returns of capital and returns on capital are separately identified and reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities and operating activities, respectively. At November 30, 2006, the JVs in which we had investments had total assets of $10.1 billion and total liabilities of $6.4 billion, which included $5.0 billion of notes and mortgages payable. These JVs usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. As of November 30, 2006, our equity in these JVs represented 39% of the entities total equity. In some instances, we and our partners have guaranteed debt of certain JVs. Our summary of guarantees related to our unconsolidated entities was as follows: November 30,2006 (In thousands) Sole recourse debt $ 18,920 Several recourse debt repayment 163,508 Several recourse debt maintenance 560,823 Joint and several recourse debt repayment 64,473 Joint and several recourse debt maintenance 956,682 Lennars maximum recourse exposure 1,764,406 Less joint and several reimbursement agreements with our partners (661,486 ) Lennars net recourse exposure $ 1,102,920 The maintenance amounts above are our maximum exposure of loss, which assumes that the fair value of the underlying collateral is zero. As of November 30, 2006, the fair values of the maintenance guarantees and repayment guarantees were not material. In addition, we and or our partners occasionally grant liens on our respective interests in a JV in order to help secure a loan to that JV. When we and or our partners provide guarantees, the JV generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. In a repayment guarantee, we and our JV partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value or the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the JV distributes. During 2006, amounts paid under our maintenance guarantees were not material. As of November 30, 2006, if there was an occurrence of a triggering event or condition under a guarantee, the collateral would be sufficient to repay the obligation. 31 Summarized financial results for unconsolidated entities in which we had investments were as follows: November 30, Balance Sheet 2006 2005 (In thousands) Assets: Cash $ 276,501 334,530 Inventories 8,955,567 7,615,489 Other assets 868,073 875,741 $ 10,100,141 8,825,760 Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 1,387,745 1,004,940 Notes and mortgages payable 5,001,625 4,486,271 Equity of: Lennar 1,447,178 1,282,686 Others 2,263,593 2,051,863 $ 10,100,141 8,825,760 Debt to total capital of our JVs is calculated as follows: November 30, 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Debt $ 5,001,625 4,486,271 Equity 3,710,771 3,334,549 Total capital $ 8,712,396 7,820,820 Debt to total capital of our JVs 57.4 % 57.4 % Years Ended November 30, Statements of Earnings 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 2,651,932 2,676,628 1,641,018 Costs and expenses: 2,588,196 2,020,470 1,199,243 Net earnings of unconsolidated entities $ 63,736 656,158 441,775 Our share of net earnings $ 24,918 241,631 148,868 Our share of net earnings (loss) recognized (1) $ (12,536 ) 133,814 90,739 Our cumulative share of net earnings deferred at November 30 $ 99,360 151,182 120,817 Our investment in unconsolidated entities $ 1,447,178 1,282,686 856,422 Equity of the unconsolidated entities $ 3,710,771 3,334,549 1,795,010 Our investment % in the unconsolidated entities 39.0 % 38.5 % 47.7 % (1) For the year ended November 30, 2006, our share of net loss recognized from unconsolidated entities includes $126.4 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. On December 29, 2006, we and LNR reached a definitive agreement to admit a new strategic partner into our LandSource joint venture. The transaction will result in a cash distribution to us and our current partner, LNR, of approximately $660 million each. For financial statement purposes, the transaction is expected to generate earnings of approximately $500 million for us, of which approximately $125 million will be recognized at closing and a potential of approximately $375 million could be realized over future years. The new partner will contribute cash and property with a combined value of approximately $900 million. Subsequent to the transaction, in addition to options we will have on certain LandSource assets, we will also have $153 million of specific performance options on other LandSource assets. Following the contribution and refinancing, our and LNRs interest in LandSource will be diluted to 19% each, and the new partner will be issued a 62% interest in LandSource. The transaction is expected to close during our first quarter of 2007. 32 Option Contracts In our homebuilding operations, we have access to land through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. These option deposits generally approximate 10% of the exercise price. These options are generally rolling options, in which we acquire homesites based on pre determined take down schedules. Our option contracts often include price escalators, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at time of the acquisition. The exercise periods of our option contracts vary on a case by case basis, but generally range from one to ten years. Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, (SFAS 144). The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options. Each option contract contains a predetermined take down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, we are not required to purchase land in accordance with those take down schedules. In substantially all instances, we have the right and ability to not exercise our option and forfeit our deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of our deposit and pre acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, we do not consider the take down price to be a firm contractual obligation. When we permit an option to terminate or walk away from an option, we write off any unapplied deposit and pre acquisition costs. For the year ended November 30, 2006, we wrote off $152.2 million of option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 24,235 homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase, compared to $15.1 million in 2005. In very limited cases, the land seller can enforce the take down schedule by requiring us to exercise our option. We record the option contract as a financing arrangement when required in accordance with SFAS No. 49, Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements, and record the optioned property and related take down liability in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluated all option contracts for land when entered into or upon a reconsideration event and determined we were the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, under FIN 46(R), we, if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, are required to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During 2006 and 2005, the effect of the consolidation of these option contracts was an increase of $548.7 million and $516.3 million, respectively, to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in our consolidated balance sheets as of November 30, 2006 and 2005. This increase was offset primarily by the exercising of our options to acquire land under certain contracts previously consolidated under FIN 46(R), resulting in a net increase in consolidated inventory not owned of $1.8 million. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46(R), we reclassified $80.7 million of related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2006. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned represent the difference between the purchase price of the optioned land and our cash deposits. At November 30, 2006 and 2005, our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non refundable option deposits and advanced costs totaling $785.9 million and $741.6 million, respectively. Additionally, we posted $553.4 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November 30, 2006. 33 The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties (optioned) or unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have investments (JVs) (i.e., controlled homesites) for each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other at November 30, 2006 and 2005: Controlled November 30, 2006 Optioned JVs Total Owned Total East 42,733 17,898 60,631 36,169 96,800 Central 27,435 30,815 58,250 21,887 80,137 West 17,959 43,789 61,748 22,390 84,138 Other 6,631 2,019 8,650 11,879 20,529 Total 94,758 94,521 189,279 92,325 281,604 Percentage 34 % 33 % 67 % 33 % 100 % Controlled November 30, 2005 Optioned JVs Total Owned Total East 60,954 15,930 76,884 39,259 116,143 Central 29,794 31,284 61,078 27,704 88,782 West 26,345 45,609 71,954 24,477 96,431 Other 9,920 2,283 12,203 11,247 23,450 Total 127,013 95,106 222,119 102,687 324,806 Percentage 39 % 29 % 68 % 32 % 100 % Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual debt obligations at November 30, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years (In thousands) Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 2,613,503 87,298 613,940 567,347 1,344,918 Financial services Notes and other debts payable 1,149,231 1,149,005 171 31 24 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt* 866,827 162,778 273,463 198,041 232,545 Operating leases 284,446 92,481 107,213 57,478 27,274 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,914,007 1,491,562 994,787 822,897 1,604,761 * Interest commitments on variable interest bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of November 30, 2006. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2006, we had access to 189,279 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2006, we had $785.9 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these homesites. Additionally, we posted $553.4 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November 30, 2006. We are committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $1.4 billion (which included the $553.4 million of letters of credit noted above) at November 30, 2006. Additionally, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of $1.8 billion. We do not believe there will be any draws upon these letters of credit or bonds, but if there were any, we do not believe these draws would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Our Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $2.9 billion at November 30, 2006. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $323.9 million as of November 30, 2006. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments and MBS option contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS forward commitments and MBS option contracts only with investment banks with primary dealer status and loan sales transactions with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value. At November 30, 2006, we had open commitments amounting to $335.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2007. The following sections discuss economic conditions, market and financing risk, seasonality, and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business: Economic Conditions During 2006, conditions in the homebuilding industry weakened and we have not yet seen a recovery as we entered the first quarter of 2007. This market deterioration has been driven primarily by excess supply as speculators reduced purchases and returned homes to the market as well as negative customer sentiment surrounding the general homebuilding market. We experienced slower sales (down 3% in 2006) and higher cancellations (29% in 2006) which have impacted most of our markets and therefore, we made greater use of sales incentives ($32,000 per home delivered in 2006, compared to $9,000 per home delivered in 2005) to generate sales in order to achieve our delivery goals which resulted in lower inventory levels. A continued decline in the prices for new homes could adversely affect both our revenues and margins, as well as the carrying value of our inventory and other investments. Market and Financing Risk We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility, issuance of commercial paper and unsecured, fixed rate notes and borrowings under our warehouse lines of credit. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings are managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. Currently, we are focusing our efforts on asset management and our homebuilding manufacturing process, in order to achieve a more evenflow production of home deliveries throughout the year. Evenflow production involves determining the appropriate production levels based on demand in the market, and is driven by a defined production schedule designed to produce a consistent level of starts and deliveries throughout the year in order to gain production efficiencies. If our efforts at evenflow production are successful, the result should be a reduction in inventory cycle time and more accurate start, completion and delivery dates. Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs, along with a more normalized home sales price appreciation in 35 2006 compared to previous years, have contributed to lower gross margins and in certain instances to inventory valuation adjustments. In recent years, the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS 109, (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides interpretive guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2007). We are currently reviewing the effect of this Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2007), and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS 157 is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006 (our fiscal year ended November 30, 2006). SAB 108 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums, (EITF 06 8). EITF 06 8 establishes that a company should evaluate the adequacy of the buyers continuing investment in determining whether to recognize profit under the percentage of completion method. EITF 06 8 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after March 15, 2007 (our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2007). The effect of this EITF is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, (SFAS 66). Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. 36 Inventories Inventories are stated at cost, unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory would be written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. We evaluate our inventory for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with SFAS 144. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of impairment is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset. We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory could be material to our consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings. We evaluate our inventory for impairment periodically on an asset by asset basis. This evaluation includes two critical assumptions with regard to future homesite sales prices, cost of sales and absorption. The two critical assumptions include the timing of the homesite sales and the discount rate applied to determine the fair value of the homesites on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of homesite sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates and unemployment levels. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop our homesites and or absorption. Our assumption on discount rates is critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during these changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $501.8 million and $20.5 million, respectively, of inventory adjustments, which included $280.5 million of homebuilding inventory valuation adjustments in 2006, $152.2 million and $15.1 million, respectively, in 2006 and 2005 of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $69.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in 2006 and 2005 of land inventory valuation adjustments. During the year ended November 30, 2004, we recorded $16.8 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase. These valuation adjustments were calculated based on current market conditions and assumptions made by our management, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions change. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2006, the reserve for warranty costs was $172.6 million. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We frequently invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. 37 Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. Management uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2006, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2006, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $10.1 billion and total liabilities of $6.4 billion. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary. The amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset. Our evaluation includes two critical assumptions: projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities and discount rates applied to the future distributions. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates and unemployment levels. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived. Our assumption on discount rates is critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entities. During the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, we did not record any material valuation adjustments to our investment in unconsolidated entities; however, during the year ended November 30, 2006, we recorded $126.4 million of valuation adjustments. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future. Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, and gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates of the policies. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Interest income on loans held for sale is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. In all circumstances, we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition. Allowance for Loan and Other Losses We provide an allowance for loan losses by taking into consideration various factors such as past loan loss experience, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may 38 influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2006, the allowance for loan losses was $1.8 million. While we believe that the 2006 year end allowance is adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market on a non recourse basis within 60 days after we originate them, remaining liable for certain representations and warranties, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher occurrence of loan charge offs. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. We provide an allowance for estimated title and escrow losses based upon managements evaluation of claims presented and estimates for any incurred but not reported claims. The allowance is established at a level that management estimates to be sufficient to satisfy those claims where a loss is determined to be probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The allowance for title and escrow losses for both known and incurred but not reported claims is considered by management to be adequate for such purposes. Homebuilding and Financial Services Operations Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. The process of determining goodwill requires judgment. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or whenever indicators of impairment exist) for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2006 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. At November 30, 2006, goodwill was $257.8 million. While we believe that no impairment existed as of November 30, 2006, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to an impairment of goodwill. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates, we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations. At November 30, 2006, our net deferred tax asset was $307.2 million. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. Share Based Payments We have share based awards outstanding under four different plans which provide for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock (nonvested shares) to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be 39 less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the plans may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant. Prior to December 1, 2005, we accounted for stock option awards granted under our share based payment plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) and related Interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (SFAS 123). Share based employee compensation expense was not recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to December 1, 2005, as all stock option awards granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Effective December 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized during 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to December 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123R resulted in a charge to net earnings of $0.11 per diluted share during 2006. We believe that the accounting estimate for share based payments is a critical accounting estimate because the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require managements judgments. These estimates include the fair value of each of our stock option awards, which are estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model as discussed in Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this document. The fair value of our stock option awards, which are subject to graded vesting, is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options. Expected volatility is based on an average of (1) historical volatility of our stock and (2) implied volatility from traded options on our stock. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award granted. We use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model. The expected life of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we presented all tax benefits related to deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS 123R requires that cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) be classified as financing cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We utilize derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The table on the following page provides information at November 30, 2006 about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investments available for sale, loans held for sale, loans held for investment and investments held to maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values at November 30, 2006. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2006. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair values at November 30, 2006. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. Our trading investments do not have interest rate sensitivity, and therefore, are also excluded from the following table. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk. 40 Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2006 Years Ending November 30, Fair Value at November 30, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (Dollars in millions) ASSETS Financial services: Loans held for sale, net: Fixed rate $ 331.4 331.4 331.4 Average interest rate 7.0 % 7.0 % Variable rate $ 152.3 152.3 152.3 Average interest rate 6.8 % 6.8 % Loans held for investment and investments held to maturity: Fixed rate $ 218.7 3.6 5.7 4.3 0.3 14.8 247.4 245.4 Average interest rate 5.8 % 7.4 % 9.5 % 6.8 % 9.2 % 8.5 % 6.1 % Variable rate $ 0.1 1.7 1.8 1.8 Average interest rate 6.1 % 6.1 % 6.1 % LIABILITIES Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 62.0 6.0 278.0 317.9 249.4 1,344.9 2,258.2 2,270.9 Average interest rate 2.6 % 7.9 % 7.6 % 5.3 % 6.0 % 5.8 % 5.9 % Variable rate $ 25.3 30.0 300.0 355.3 355.3 Average interest rate 9.6 % 9.3 % 6.1 % 6.7 % Financial services: Notes and other debts payable: Variable rate $ 1,149.0 0.1 0.1 1,149.2 1,149.2 Average interest rate 6.1 % 7.1 % 7.2 % 6.1 % OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Homebuilding liabilities: Interest rate swaps: Variable to fixed notional amount $ 130.3 69.7 200.0 2.1 Average pay rate 6.8 % 6.8 % 6.8 % Average receive rate LIBOR LIBOR 41 Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2006. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein. 42 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2006 of the Company and our report dated February 8, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Certified Public Accountants Miami, Florida February 8, 2007 43
