Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements, except as required by Federal securities laws. Outlook The housing market has continued to deteriorate throughout 2007. Consumer confidence in housing has declined, while there has been increased volatility in the mortgage market, creating higher cancellation rates and lower net new orders. The market has continued to become more and more competitive and there continues to be a great deal of downward pricing through the use of incentives, price reductions and incentivized brokerage fees. These conditions could lead to increased supply of homes for sale in the market due to additional foreclosures, further exacerbating competitive market pressures. As we enter 2008, we do not currently have visibility as to when these deteriorating market conditions will subside. Our response to, and primary focus in, this environment continues to be to reduce home starts and adjust pricing to meet current market conditions in order to keep inventories low and our balance sheet positioned for the future. In addition, we have also decreased land purchases where possible. The net effect has been a continued deterioration of our margins and accordingly, higher valuation adjustments to our inventory and our share of inventory at unconsolidated entities, as well as write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs. We also have, and continue to, reduce overhead to be right sized for anticipated lower volume levels. While it has been challenging to stay ahead of rapidly adjusting market conditions and resulting revenue reductions, we have reduced our workforce to date by approximately 50% from our peak in 2006. During 2007, we re evaluated all of our joint venture arrangements, with particular focus on those ventures with recourse indebtedness. We began to reduce the number of joint ventures in which we were participating, and the recourse indebtedness of these joint ventures. As of November 30, 2007, we had reduced the number of joint ventures in which we were participating to approximately 210 joint ventures with net recourse indebtedness exposure to us of $794.9 million, compared with 260 joint ventures with net recourse indebtedness exposure to us of $1.1 billion at November 30, 2006. In 2008, we plan to continue this trend of reducing the number of joint ventures and net recourse indebtedness exposure related to joint ventures. If the market does not begin to stabilize and there is further deterioration in market conditions, this may lead to an increase in the supply of new and existing homes as a result of decreased absorption levels and increased foreclosures. The decrease in sales absorption may lead to higher sales incentives and reduced gross margins, which may lead to additional valuation adjustments in the future. Additionally, market conditions may cause us to re evaluate our strategy regarding certain assets that could result in additional valuation adjustments related to our inventory and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs as a result of the abandonment of option contracts. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may need to reassess the value of the underlying collateral and or renegotiate the terms of land seller notes receivable, which may result in additional write offs in the future. With respect to the loans we originate on the homes we deliver, although we remain liable for certain limited representations, substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary mortgage market, on a servicing released, non recourse basis. Therefore, we have little direct exposure with the residential mortgages we sell. During 2007, the mortgage market experienced increased volatility. This volatility has led to changes in the secondary mortgage market with respect to loans. As demand in the secondary mortgage market changes with 21 respect to loans for sub prime (loans to persons with a FICO score under 620) and Alt A borrowers (loans to persons with less conventional documentation of their incomes or net worths and FICO score of 620 or higher), there may be fewer buyers who qualify for financing on new and existing home purchases in the market. During both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the year ended November 30, 2007, approximately 2% of the loans our Financial Services segment made to our homebuyers were sub prime loans. During the fourth quarter of 2007 and the year ended November 30, 2007, approximately 6% and 29%, respectively, of the loans our Financial Services segment made to our homebuyers were Alt A loans. The tightening of lending standards could lead to a further deterioration in the overall homebuilding market due to stricter credit standards, higher down payment requirements and additional credit verification requirements. This deterioration could have an adverse impact on the number of homes we sell. In addition, to the extent that homeowners have used sub prime or Alt A mortgages to finance the purchase of their homes and are later unable to refinance or maintain those loans, additional foreclosures and an oversupply of inventory may result in the market. This may also contribute to additional deterioration in the market and have an adverse impact on demand and the number of homes we sell. Results of Operations Overview Our net loss in 2007 was $1.9 billion, or $12.31 per basic and diluted share, compared to net earnings of $593.9 million, or $3.69 per diluted share ($3.76 per basic share), in 2006. The decrease in net earnings was attributable to weak market conditions that have persisted during 2007 and have impacted all of our operations. The losses in 2007 also resulted in a net operating loss (NOL) for income tax purposes. As a result, we filed NOL carryback claims and received tax refunds of $852 million subsequent to our fiscal year end. The following table sets forth financial and operational information for the years indicated related to our continuing operations. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years were not material to our consolidated financial statements and are included in the tables since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands, except average sales price) Homebuilding revenues: Sales of homes $ 9,462,940 14,854,874 12,711,789 Sales of land 267,312 768,166 592,810 Total homebuilding revenues 9,730,252 15,623,040 13,304,599 Homebuilding costs and expenses: Cost of homes sold 8,892,268 12,114,433 9,410,343 Cost of land sold 1,928,451 798,165 391,984 Selling, general and administrative 1,368,358 1,764,967 1,412,917 Total homebuilding costs and expenses 12,189,077 14,677,565 11,215,244 Gain on recapitalization of unconsolidated entity 175,879 Goodwill impairments 190,198 Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities (362,899 ) (12,536 ) 133,814 Management fees and other income (expense), net (76,029 ) 66,629 98,952 Minority interest expense, net 1,927 13,415 45,030 Homebuilding operating earnings (loss) (2,913,999 ) 986,153 2,277,091 Financial services revenues 456,529 643,622 562,372 Financial services costs and expenses 450,409 493,819 457,604 Financial services operating earnings 6,120 149,803 104,768 Total operating earnings (loss) (2,907,879 ) 1,135,956 2,381,859 Corporate general and administrative expenses 173,202 193,307 187,257 Loss on redemption of 9.95% senior notes 34,908 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (3,081,081 ) 942,649 2,159,694 Gross margin on home sales 6.0 % 18.4 % 26.0 % SG&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales 14.5 % 11.9 % 11.1 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales (8.4 )% 6.6 % 14.9 % Gross margin on home sales excluding valuation adjustments (1) 13.9 % 20.3 % 26.0 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments (1) (0.5 )% 8.5 % 14.9 % Average sales price $ 297,000 315,000 311,000 22 (1) Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and operating margin as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments are non GAAP financial measures disclosed by certain of our competitors and have been presented because we find it useful in evaluating our performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors. 2007 versus 2006 Revenues from home sales decreased 36% in the year ended November 30, 2007 to $9.5 billion from $14.9 billion in 2006. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 33% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 6% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2007. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 31,582 homes in the year ended November 30, 2007 from 47,032 homes last year. In the year ended November 30, 2007, new home deliveries were lower in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2006. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $297,000 in the year ended November 30, 2007 from $315,000 in 2006, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($48,000 per home delivered in 2007, compared to $32,000 per home delivered in 2006). Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $1.3 billion, or 13.9%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to $3.0 billion, or 20.3%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of our homebuilding segments primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales were $570.7 million, or 6.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $747.8 million of SFAS 144 inventory valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $2.7 billion, or 18.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2006, which included $280.5 million of SFAS 144 inventory valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of our competitors and has been presented because we find it useful in evaluating its performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $203.7 million in 2007, compared to $241.1 million in 2006. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from lower average debt during 2007, as well as decreased deliveries during 2007, compared to 2006. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2007 was 37.5%, compared to 31.4% as of November 30, 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $396.6 million, or 22%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount and variable selling expenses. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 14.5% in the year ended November 30, 2007, from 11.9% in 2006. The 260 basis point increase was primarily due to lower revenues. Loss on land sales totaled $1.7 billion in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $740.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments on the inventory acquired by the Morgan Stanley land investment venture discussed below, $426.9 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $530.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 36,900 homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase. In the year ended November 30, 2006, loss on land sales totaled $30.0 million, which included $69.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $152.2 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 24,200 homesites that were under option. In November 2007, we and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., formed a strategic land investment venture to acquire, develop, manage and sell residential real estate. We acquired a 20% ownership interest and 50% voting rights in the land investment venture. Concurrent with the formation of the land investment venture, we sold a diversified portfolio of our land to the venture for $525 million. The properties acquired by the new entity consist of approximately 11,000 homesites in 32 communities located throughout the country. The properties sold by us had a net book value of approximately $1.3 billion. As part of the transaction, we entered into option agreements and obtained rights of first offer providing us the opportunity to purchase certain finished homesites. The exercise price of the options is based on a fixed percentage of the future home price. We have no obligation to exercise these options and cannot acquire a majority of the entitys assets. We are managing the land investment ventures operations and receive fees for our services. We will also receive disproportionate distributions if the investment venture exceeds certain financial targets. 23 Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory remained on our balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned as of November 30, 2007. Additionally, the $445 million of net cash received from the transaction was recorded in liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the consolidated balance sheet and classified as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a SFAS 144 valuation adjustment of $740.4 million on the inventory sold to the land investment venture. Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $362.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $364.2 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the assets of our investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $12.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, which included $126.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the assets of our investments in unconsolidated entities last year. During the year ended November 30, 2007, we recorded goodwill impairments of $190.2 million related to our homebuilding operations. Management fees and other expense, net, totaled $76.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $132.2 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to management fees and other income, net, of $66.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, net of $14.5 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. Minority interest expense, net was $1.9 million and $13.4 million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006. Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income (expense), net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. In February 2007, our LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. As part of the transaction, the joint venture obtained $1.6 billion of non recourse financing, which consisted of a $200 million five year Revolving Credit Facility, a $1.1 billion six year Term Loan B Facility and a $244 million seven year Second Lien Term Facility. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to us of $707.6 million, but reduced our resulting ownership of LandSource to 16%. If LandSource reaches certain financial targets, we will have a disproportionate share of the entitys future positive net cash flow. As a result of the recapitalization, we recognized a pretax gain of $175.9 million in 2007 and could potentially recognize additional profits in future years, in addition to profits from our continuing ownership interest. Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $6.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to $149.8 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in profitability from both the segments mortgage and title operations and $28.4 million of partial write offs of land seller notes receivable. The decline in profitability was due to the overall weakness in the housing market, which led to a decrease in volume and transactions for the mortgage and title operations compared to last year. Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $20.1 million, or 10%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 1.7% in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to 1.2% in the same period last year, primarily due to lower revenues. At November 30, 2007, we owned 62,801 homesites and had access to an additional 85,870 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2007, 5% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 4,009 homes ($1.4 billion) at November 30, 2007, compared to 11,608 homes ($4.0 billion) at November 30, 2006. The lower backlog was attributable to weak market conditions that persisted during 2007, which resulted in lower new orders in 2007, compared to 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the year ended November 30, 2006 to $14.9 billion from $12.7 billion in 2005. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 15% increase in the number of home deliveries in 2006. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 47,032 homes in the year ended November 30, 2006 from 40,882 homes in 2005. In the year ended November 30, 2006, new home deliveries 24 were higher in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2005. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $315,000 in the year ended November 30, 2006 from $311,000 in 2005 despite higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($32,000 per home delivered in 2006, compared to $9,000 per home delivered in 2005). Despite the full year increases, there was a significant slowdown in new home sales throughout the country as the year progressed. As a result, during the fourth quarter of the year, revenues from home sales declined by 14%, new home deliveries declined by 4%, excluding unconsolidated entities, and the average sales price declined by 11%, compared with the same period of the prior year. The decline in average sales price resulted from our use of higher sales incentives. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $3.0 billion, or 20.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $3.3 billion, or 26.0%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year in all of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $2.7 billion, or 18.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2006 due to $280.5 million of inventory valuation adjustments. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $241.1 million in 2006, compared to $187.2 million in 2005. The increase in interest expense was due to higher interest costs resulting from higher average debt during 2006, as well as increased deliveries during 2006, compared to 2005. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2006 was 31.4%, compared to 33.1% as of November 30, 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales were 11.9% and 11.1%, respectively, for the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. The 80 basis point increase was primarily due to increases in broker commissions and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Management fees of $37.4 million received during the year ended November 30, 2005 from unconsolidated entities in which we had investments, which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, have been reclassified to management fees and other income, net in order to conform to the 2006 presentation. Loss on land sales totaled $30.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, net of $152.2 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 24,200 homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase and $69.1 million of inventory valuation adjustments, compared to gross profit from land sales of $200.8 million in 2005. Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($12.5) million in the year ended November 30, 2006, which included $126.4 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $133.8 million in 2005. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $66.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $99.0 million in 2005. Minority interest expense, net was $13.4 million and $45.0 million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. Sales of land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, net and minority interest expense, net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Financial Services segment were $149.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $104.8 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to a $17.7 million pretax gain generated from monetizing the segments personal lines insurance policies, as well as increased profitability from the segments mortgage operations as a result of increased volume and profit per loan. The segments mortgage capture rate (i.e., the percentage of our homebuyers, excluding cash settlements, who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services) was 66% in both the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 1.2% in the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to 1.4% in the same period in 2005. 25 At November 30, 2006, we owned 92,325 homesites and had access to an additional 189,279 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2006, 10% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 11,608 homes ($4.0 billion) at November 30, 2006, compared to 18,565 homes ($6.9 billion) at November 30, 2005. As a result of pricing our homes to market through the use of higher sales incentives, building out our inventory and delivering our backlog in an effort to maintain an inventory neutral position, our backlog declined in 2006. The lower backlog was also attributable to the depressed market conditions during 2006, which resulted in lower new orders in 2006, compared to 2005. At November 30, 2006, our inventory balance was consistent with the balance at November 30, 2005. Homebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations also purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures. We have grouped our homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central and Homebuilding West. Information about homebuilding activities in states in which our homebuilding activities are not economically similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other. References in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those reportable segments. At November 30, 2007, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in the following states: East: Florida, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas. West: California and Nevada. Other: Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 30% (34%, 30%, 29% and 20%, respectively, in our Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other) in 2007, compared to 29% (32%, 27%, 30% and 22%, respectively, in our Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other) in 2006 and 17% (15%, 19%, 17% and 14%, respectively, in our Homebuilding East, Central and West segments and Homebuilding Other) in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2007, our cancellation rate was 33%. Although we experienced a higher than normal cancellation rate during 2007, we remained focused on reselling these homes, which, in many instances, included the use of higher sales incentives (discussed below as a percentage of revenues from home sales) to avoid the build up of excess inventory. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners, except for our multi level residential buildings under construction for which revenue was recognized under percentage of completion accounting. 28 2007 versus 2006 East: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in Florida and a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $368.0 million, or 13.7%, in 2007, compared to $1.0 billion, or 22.0%, in 2006. Gross margins decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (16.9% in 2007, compared to 11.4% in 2006). Gross margins on home sales were $89.0 million, or 3.3% in 2007 including SFAS 144 valuation adjustments of $279.1 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $865.0 million, or 18.6%, in 2006 including $155.7 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Loss on land sales was $400.8 million in 2007 (including $119.6 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $307.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to loss on land sales of $63.7 million in 2006 (including $80.5 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $24.7 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments). Central: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment, and a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Arizona and Colorado. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $367.8 million, or 15.6%, in 2007, compared to $631.5 million, or 17.8%, in 2006. Gross margins decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (11.3% in 2007, compared to 9.1% in 2006). Gross margins on home sales were $273.6 million, or 11.6% in 2007 including SFAS 144 valuation adjustments of $94.2 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $604.4 million, or 17.1%, in 2006 including $27.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments primarily in Arizona and Colorado. Loss on land sales was $141.2 million in 2007 (including $57.1 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $80.9 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to gross profit on land sales of $5.1 million in 2006 (net of $3.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $17.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments). West: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries and average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $451.0 million, or 13.0%, in 2007, compared to $1.2 billion, or 22.4%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (14.3% in 2007, compared to 7.5% in 2006). Gross margins on home sales were $119.1 million, or 3.4% in 2007 including SFAS 144 valuation adjustments of $331.8 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $1.1 billion, or 20.9%, in 2006 including $80.2 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments in all states. Loss on land sales was $950.3 million in 2007 (including $310.8 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $648.6 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to gross profit on land sales of $84.7 million in 2006 (net of $44.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase). Other: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment, and a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Illinois. Gross margins from home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $131.7 million, or 13.9%, in 2007, compared to $143.9 million, or 12.0%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased compared to last year primarily due to the decrease in homebuilding revenues despite higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (9.1% in 2007, compared to 7.8% in 2006). Gross margins on home sales were $88.9 million, or 9.4% in 2007 including SFAS 144 valuation adjustments of $42.8 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $126.5 million, or 10.5%, in 2006 including $17.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments primarily in Arizona and Colorado. Loss on land sales was $168.8 million in 2007 (including $42.4 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $130.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to loss on land sales of $56.1 million in 2006 (including $24.8 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $27.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments). 29 2006 versus 2005 East: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Florida and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and New Jersey. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $1.0 billion, or 22.0%, in 2006, compared to $976.9 million, or 28.5%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (11.4% in 2006, compared to 1.8% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $865.0 million, or 18.6%, in 2006 due to a total of $155.7 million of inventory valuation adjustments in all states. Loss on land sales was $63.7 million in 2006 (including $80.5 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $24.7 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to gross profit on land sales of $24.1 million in 2005 (including $3.3 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $0.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments). Central: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Arizona and Texas, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Arizona and Colorado. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $631.5 million, or 17.8%, in 2006, compared to $657.7 million, or 20.6%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (9.1% in 2006, compared to 5.3% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $604.4 million, or 17.1%, in 2006 due to $27.1 million of inventory valuation adjustments primarily in Arizona and Colorado. Gross profit on land sales were $5.1 million in 2006 (net of $3.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $17.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to gross profit on land sales of $45.6 million in 2005 (net of $0.3 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase). West: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Nevada, due to higher deliveries in Reno. Gross margins on home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $1.2 billion, or 22.4%, in 2006, compared to $1.5 billion, or 29.3%, in 2005. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to 2005 primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (7.5% in 2006, compared to 1.5% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $1.1 billion, or 20.9%, in 2006 due to a total of $80.2 million of inventory valuation adjustments in all states. Gross profits on land sales were $84.7 million in 2006 (net of $44.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase), compared to gross profit on land sales of $132.7 million in 2005 (net of $10.1 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase). Other: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in the Carolinas, Minnesota and New York, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in the Carolinas and New York. Gross margins from home sales excluding inventory valuation adjustments were $143.9 million, or 12.0%, in 2006, compared to $191.8 million, or 18.0%, in 2005. Gross margins on home sales decreased compared to 2005 primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers (7.8% in 2006, compared to 4.7% in 2005), particularly during the second half of the year. Gross margins on home sales including inventory valuation adjustments were $126.5 million, or 10.5%, in 2006 due to $17.4 million of inventory valuation adjustments primarily in Illinois and Minnesota. Loss on land sales was $56.1 million in 2006 (including $24.8 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $27.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to loss on land sales of $1.6 million in 2005 (including $1.4 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $4.9 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments). 30 Financial Services Segment We have one Financial Services reportable segment that provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and other ancillary services (including high speed Internet and cable television) for both buyers of our homes and others. Substantially all of the loans the Financial Services segment originates are sold in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis; although, we remain liable for certain limited representations. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services segment. The results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the table since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 456,529 643,622 562,372 Costs and expenses 450,409 493,819 457,604 Operating earnings from continuing operations $ 6,120 149,803 104,768 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 7,740,000 10,480,000 9,509,000 Number of mortgages originated 30,900 41,800 42,300 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 73 % 66 % 66 % Number of title and closing service transactions 136,300 161,300 187,700 Number of title policies issued 146,200 195,700 193,900 Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2007, we had cash related to our homebuilding and financial services operations of $795.2 million, compared to $778.3 million at November 30, 2006. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and our warehouse lines of credit. Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2007 and 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $444.5 million and $552.5 million, respectively. During 2007, cash flows provided by operating activities resulted from a decrease in our inventory as a result of reduced land purchases, a reduction in construction in progress resulting from lower new home starts and write offs and valuation adjustments pertaining to the respective inventory. In order to reduce our inventory levels in 2007, we focused our efforts on adjusting pricing to meet market conditions, as we pulled back production and curtailed land purchases where possible in order to keep our balance sheet positioned for future opportunities. Cash flows provided by operating activities also consisted of distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities, our equity in loss from unconsolidated entities including our share of valuation adjustments related to assets of the unconsolidated entities and a decrease in our receivables including a decrease in financial services receivable and loans held for sale resulting from a decline in our new home deliveries during the year. Cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by our net loss, deferred income tax benefit, an increase in other assets primarily due to our income tax receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities primarily due to a decrease in our land purchases. During 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities and the change in inventories including inventory write offs and valuation adjustments, partially offset by a deferred income tax benefit and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities. Investing Cash Flow Activities Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $307.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to cash used in investing activities of $404.4 million in 2006. During the year ended November 30, 2007, we contributed $608.0 million of cash to unconsolidated entities, compared to $729.3 million in 2006. Our investing activities also included distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities during the year ended 31 November 30, 2007 and 2006 of $542.3 million and $321.6 million, respectively. During 2007, we received distributions of $354.6 million in excess of our investment in the LandSource joint venture due to its recapitalization in 2007. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. However, at November 30, 2007, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions. Financing Cash Flow Activities During 2007, we sold a diversified portfolio of land to our land investment joint venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P. for $525 million. As part of the transaction, we entered into option agreements and obtained rights of first offer, providing us the opportunity to purchase certain finished homesites. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory remained on our balance sheet as of November 30, 2007. As a result of the transaction, we received $445 million of cash (net of our deposit on the homesites under option and our invested contribution to the land investment venture). Homebuilding debt to total capital and net homebuilding debt to total capital are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. Management believes providing a measure of leverage of our homebuilding operations enables readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance and we find it useful in evaluating our performance. Homebuilding debt to total capital and net homebuilding debt to total capital are calculated as follows: November 30, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Homebuilding debt $ 2,295,436 2,613,503 Stockholders equity 3,822,119 5,701,372 Total capital $ 6,117,555 8,314,875 Homebuilding debt to total capital 37.5 % 31.4 % Homebuilding debt $ 2,295,436 2,613,503 Less: Homebuilding cash 642,467 661,662 Net homebuilding debt $ 1,652,969 1,951,841 Net homebuilding debt to total capital (1) 30.2 % 25.5 % (1) Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity). Homebuilding debt to total capital and net homebuilding debt to total capital at November 30, 2007 were higher than prior year due to the decrease in stockholders equity primarily as a result of inventory valuation adjustments, write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs, SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities, APB 18 valuation adjustments to investments in unconsolidated entities, goodwill impairments and financial services write offs of notes receivable, all of which are non cash items. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. 32 The following table summarizes our homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009 $ 279,491 277,830 5.125% senior notes due 2010 299,825 299,766 5.95% senior notes due 2011 249,516 249,415 5.95% senior notes due 2013 346,268 345,719 5.50% senior notes due 2014 247,806 247,559 5.60% senior notes due 2015 501,804 501,957 6.50% senior notes due 2016 249,708 249,683 Senior floating rate notes due 2009 300,000 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 121,018 141,574 $ 2,295,436 2,613,503 Our average debt outstanding was $3.1 billion in 2007, compared to $4.0 billion in 2006. The average rate for interest incurred was 5.8% in 2007, compared to 5.7% in 2006. Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt for the year ended November 30, 2007 was $199.1 million, compared to $232.1 million in 2006. The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility, as amended, consists of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2011. However, our borrowings under the Credit Facility cannot exceed a borrowing base, consisting of specified percentages of various types of our assets. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries (which include mortgage and title insurance agency subsidiaries). Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are LIBOR based, with margins determined based on changes in our credit ratings, or an alternate base rate, as described in the credit agreement. During the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, the average daily borrowings under the Credit Facility were $143.2 million and $447.4 million, respectively. At November 30, 2007, we had no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility. In addition, at November 30, 2007 and 2006, $443.5 million and $496.9 million, respectively, of our total letters of credit outstanding discussed below, were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facility. As amended, our Credit Facility requires that recourse indebtedness of joint ventures in which we participate be reduced by $300 million during our 2008 fiscal year and by an additional $200 million (for a total of $500 million) by the end of fiscal 2009. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, we had both financial and performance letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $814.4 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were $424.2 million and $727.6 million, respectively, as of November 30, 2007 and 2006. These letters of credit are posted with either regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. In September 2007, we terminated our structured letter of credit facility (the LC Facility) reducing the commitment amount to zero. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the LC Facility were transferred to other existing facilities or matured prior to the LC Facilitys termination. In June 2007, we redeemed our $300 million senior floating rate notes due 2009. The redemption price was $300.0 million, or 100% of the principal amount of the senior floating rate notes due 2009 outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. In November 2006, we redeemed our $200 million senior floating rate notes due 2007. The redemption price was $200.0 million, or 100% of the principal amount of the senior floating rate notes due 2007 outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. In April 2006, substantially all of our outstanding 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021, (the Convertible Notes) were converted by the noteholders into 4.9 million Class A common shares. The Convertible Notes were convertible at a rate of 14.2 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. Convertible Notes not converted by the noteholders were not material and were 33 redeemed by us on April 4, 2006. The redemption price was $468.10 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented the original issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the redemption date. In April 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and $250 million of 6.50% senior notes due 2016 (collectively, the New Senior Notes) at prices of 99.766% and 99.873%, respectively, in a private placement under SEC Rule 144A. Proceeds from the offering of the New Senior Notes, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $248.7 million and $248.9 million, respectively. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the New Senior Notes is due semi annually. The New Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, and substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guarantee the New Senior Notes. In October 2006, we completed an exchange offer of the New Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Exchange Notes), with substantially all of the New Senior Notes being exchanged for the Exchange Notes. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of the Exchange Notes was $499.2 million and $499.1 million, respectively. In March 2006, we initiated a commercial paper program (the Program) under which we issued short term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion. This Program allowed us to obtain more favorable short term borrowing rates than we would obtain otherwise. The Program is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Issuances under the Program were guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are also guarantors of our Credit Facility. The average daily borrowings under the Program in 2007 were $528.8 million, compared to average daily borrowings of $553.3 million from its inception in March 2006 through November 30, 2006. We also had an arrangement with a financial institution whereby we entered into short term, unsecured, fixed rate notes from time to time. During the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, the average daily borrowings under these notes were $36.8 million and $379.0 million, respectively. In October 2007, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) issued a downgrade of our senior debt, lowering the rating to Ba1, and changed the rating of our commercial paper to not prime. In November 2007, Standard & Poors (S&P) issued a downgrade of our senior debt, lowering the rating to BB+ and removed the rating of our commercial paper. As a result of these rating actions, our senior debt is no longer rated as investment grade by Moodys and S&P, although it retains an investment grade rating from Fitch. As a result of our current ratings, we no longer have access to the markets for commercial paper, nor unsecured, fixed rate notes. In September 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2010 (the 5.125% Senior Notes) at a price of 99.905% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $298.2 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is due semi annually. The 5.125% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the 5.125% Senior Notes. In 2006, we exchanged the 5.125% Senior Notes for registered notes. The registered notes have substantially identical terms as the 5.125% Senior Notes, except that the registered notes do not include transfer restrictions that are applicable to the 5.125% Senior Notes. At both November 30, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes was $299.8 million. In April 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2015 (the Senior Notes) at a price of 99.771%. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $297.5 million. In July 2005, we sold $200 million of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2015 at a price of 101.407%. The Senior Notes were the same issue as the Senior Notes we sold in April 2005. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $203.9 million. We added the proceeds of both offerings to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi annually. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for identical Senior Notes that had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of the Senior Notes sold in April and July 2005 was $501.8 million and $502.0 million, respectively. In May 2005, we redeemed all of our outstanding 9.95% Senior Notes due 2010 (the Notes). The redemption price was $337.7 million, or 104.975% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. The redemption of the Notes resulted in a $34.9 million pretax loss. 34 Substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, have guaranteed all our Senior Notes (the Guaranteed Notes). The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly and indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The principal reason our wholly owned subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time, however, when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Currently, the only debt the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing other than the Guaranteed Notes is Lennar Corporations principal revolving bank credit line (currently the Credit Facility). Therefore, if, the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under its principal revolving bank credit line and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes. If the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing a revolving credit line totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit line is less than $75 million. Because it is possible that our banks will permit some or all of the guarantor subsidiaries to stop guaranteeing our revolving credit line, it is possible that, at some time or times in the future, the Guaranteed Notes will no longer be guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. At November 30, 2007, our Financial Services segment had a conduit and warehouse facility totaling $1.0 billion, recently reduced from $1.1 billion in order to obtain a waiver of a financial covenant, compared to $1.4 billion at November 30, 2006. It uses those facilities to finance its lending activities until it accumulates sufficient mortgage loans to be able to sell them into the capital markets. Borrowings under the lines of credit were $505.4 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, at November 30, 2007 and 2006 and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded by the investor with outstanding principal balances of $540.9 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, at November 30, 2007 and 2006. There are several interest rate pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2007 and 2006 was 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively. The lines of credit consist of a conduit facility, which matures in June 2008 ($600 million) and a warehouse facility which matures in April 2008 ($425 million). In the past, we have been able to obtain renewals of these facilities at the times of their maturities; however, given our reduced volume of deliveries, our financing requirements have decreased. Therefore, we are working with several other lenders in case these facilities are not renewed. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, we had advances under a different conduit funding agreement amounting to $11.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, which had an effective interest rate of 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively at November 30, 2007 and 2006. We also had a $25 million revolving line of credit that matures in May 2008, at which time we expect the line of credit to be renewed. The line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the Financial Services segment and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $24.0 million and $23.7 million, respectively, at November 30, 2007 and 2006 and had an effective interest rate of 5.7% and 6.3%, respectively, at November 30, 2007 and 2006. We had various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively converted variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on $200 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. In June 2007, we redeemed the variable rate debt that was being hedged by the various interest rate swap agreements. Our last remaining interest rate swap was terminated in June 2007. The net effect on our operating results was that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged was recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements were major financial institutions. At November 30, 2007, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. At November 30, 2006, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $2.1 million liability. Our Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Financial Services segment enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. In January 2008, we completed an amendment to the Credit Facility that modified the minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement and restructured the borrowing base. Therefore, effective November 30, 2007, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt arrangements. However, the commitment was reduced to $1.5 billion and we are required to reduce the recourse debt of joint ventures in 35 which we have investments by $300 million during our 2008 fiscal year and an additional $200 million (for a total of $500 million) by the end of fiscal 2009. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, we might have to request of our lenders additional waivers or amendments to our Credit Facility. There is no assurance that our lenders would agree to such an amendment or waiver. Changes in Capital Structure In June 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to permit the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During 2007, there were no material share repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2006, we repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price including commissions of $320.1 million, or $51.59 per share. As of November 30, 2007, 6.2 million shares of common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program. Treasury stock increased by 0.8 million Class A common shares during the year ended November 30, 2007, primarily related to forfeitures of restricted stock. In addition to the common shares purchased under our stock repurchase program during the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, we also repurchased approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million Class A common shares, respectively, related to the vesting of restricted stock and distribution of common stock from our deferred compensation plan. In 2007 and 2006, we paid dividends with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock at the rate of $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly). In September 2005, our Board of Directors voted to increase the annual dividend rate with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.55 per share per year (payable quarterly). Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Investments in Unconsolidated Entities At November 30, 2007, we had equity investments in approximately 210 unconsolidated entities, compared to approximately 260 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2006. Due to current market conditions, we are focused on continuing to reduce the number of unconsolidated entities that we have investments in. Our investments in unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows: November 30, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Land development $ 738,481 1,163,671 Homebuilding 195,790 283,507 Total investment $ 934,271 1,447,178 During 2007, as homebuilding market conditions deteriorated, we recorded $364.2 million of valuation adjustments related to the assets of our investments in unconsolidated entities for the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to $126.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2006. In addition, we recorded $132.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively, of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006. After the valuation adjustments, as of November 30, 2007, we believe that our investment in joint ventures (JVs) is fully recoverable. We will continue to monitor our investments and the recoverability of assets owned by the JVs. We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Through these entities, we primarily seek to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners in these JVs are land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. JVs with land owners/developers give us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partner. JVs 36 with other homebuilders provide us with the ability to bid jointly with our partner for large land parcels. JVs with financial partners allow us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. JVs with strategic partners allow us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Although the strategic purposes of our JVs and the nature of our JV partners vary, the JVs are generally designed to acquire, develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time. The JVs are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each JV is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other JV participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the JV. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. The capital contributions usually coincide in time with the acquisition of properties by the JV. Additionally, most JVs obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The JV agreements usually permit, but do not require, the JVs to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment or maintenance guarantees generally is required. Under the terms of our JV agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some JV agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the JV exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Our equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of JVs earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the JVs. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the JVs earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyer. In some instances, we are designated as the manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option contracts to acquire properties from our JVs, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts generally require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits generally approximate 10% of the exercise price. We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated JVs and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. JVs in which we have investments are subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of JVs in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those JVs not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. Our arrangements with JVs generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the JVs do business. As discussed above, the JVs in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities. In many instances, the debt financing is non recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guarantees. Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated JVs primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The JVs generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the JV participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some JVs also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other JV participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes. The JVs often enter into option agreements with buyers, which may include us or other JV participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the JVs as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated JVs generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements. As described above, the liquidity needs of JVs in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development 37 activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the JVs members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a JV to distribute at any given time is a function of the scope of the JVs activities and the stage in the JVs life cycle. We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our JVs. For purposes of classifying distributions received from JVs in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities. At November 30, 2007, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $9.1 billion and total liabilities of $6.3 billion, which included $5.1 billion of debt. These unconsolidated entities usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. As of November 30, 2007, our equity in these unconsolidated entities represented 34% of the entities total equity. Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt to different unconsolidated entities; however, some unconsolidated entities own multiple properties and other assets. In connection with a loan to an unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any, or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee). In connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity where there is a joint and several guarantee, we often have a reimbursement agreement with our partner. The reimbursement agreement provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee. However, if our joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The summary of our net recourse exposure related to our unconsolidated entities was as follows: November 30, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Sole recourse debt $ 18,920 Several recourse debt repayment 123,022 163,508 Several recourse debt maintenance 355,513 560,823 Joint and several recourse debt repayment 263,364 64,473 Joint and several recourse debt maintenance 291,727 956,682 Lennars maximum recourse exposure 1,033,626 1,764,406 Less joint and several reimbursement agreements with Lennars partners (238,692 ) (661,486 ) Lennars net recourse exposure $ 794,934 1,102,920 The maintenance amounts above are our maximum exposure to loss from maintenance guarantees, which assumes that the fair value of the underlying collateral is zero because it does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral. As amended, our Credit Facility requires us to reduce the recourse debt of joint ventures in which we have investments by $300 million during our 2008 fiscal year and by an additional $200 million (for a total of $500 million) by the end of fiscal 2009. In addition, we and or our partners occasionally grant liens on our respective interests in an unconsolidated entity in order to help secure a loan to that entity. When we and or our partners provide guarantees, the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified 38 percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment may constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes. During the year ended November 30, 2007, amounts paid under our maintenance guarantees were $84.1 million. During the year ended November 30, 2006, we did not make any material payments under maintenance guarantees. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, as of November 30, 2007, the fair values of the maintenance guarantees and repayment guarantees were not material. We believe that as of November 30, 2007, if there was an occurrence of a triggering event or condition under a guarantee, the collateral should be sufficient to repay a significant portion of the obligation or in certain circumstances, partners may be requested to contribute additional capital into the venture. In many of the loans to unconsolidated entities, we and another entity or entities generally related to our subsidiarys joint venture partner(s), have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction was to be done in phases, very often the guarantee is to complete only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used. Under many of the completion guarantees, the guarantors are permitted, under certain circumstances, to use undisbursed loan proceeds to satisfy the completion of obligations, and in many of those cases, pay interest only on those funds, with no repayment of the principal of such funds required. The total debt of the unconsolidated entities was as follows: November 30, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Lennars net recourse exposure $ 794,934 1,102,920 Reimbursement agreements from partners 238,692 661,486 Partner several recourse 465,641 930,177 Non recourse land seller debt or other debt 202,048 259,191 Non recourse debt with completion guarantees 1,432,880 948,438 Non recourse debt without completion guarantees 1,982,475 1,099,413 Total debt $ 5,116,670 5,001,625 Some of the unconsolidated entities debt arrangements contain certain financial covenants. As market conditions deteriorated in the year ended November 30, 2007, we closely monitored these covenants and the unconsolidated entities ability to comply with them. In these difficult market conditions, some of the unconsolidated entities may have to request of their lenders waivers or amendments to debt agreements so that the unconsolidated entities would remain in compliance with such covenants. Additionally, we may have to extend or refinance the debt of our unconsolidated entities if the operations of the unconsolidated entities are not on track to meet their projected cash flows. Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to unconsolidated entities in which we had investments that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows: Balance Sheets November 30, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Assets: Cash $ 301,468 276,501 Inventories 7,941,835 8,955,567 Other assets 827,208 868,073 $ 9,070,511 10,100,141 Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 1,214,374 1,387,745 Debt 5,116,670 5,001,625 Equity of: Lennar 934,271 1,447,178 Others 1,805,196 2,263,593 $ 9,070,511 10,100,141 39 Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities is calculated as follows: November 30, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Debt $ 5,116,670 5,001,625 Equity 2,739,467 3,710,771 Total capital $ 7,856,137 8,712,396 Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities 65.1 % 57.4 % As of November 30, 2007, debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities, excluding our LandSource joint venture, was 61.1%, compared to 59.2% at November 30, 2006. Statements of Operations and Selected Information Years Ended November 30, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 2,060,279 2,651,932 2,676,628 Costs and expenses: 3,075,696 2,588,196 2,020,470 Net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities $ (1,015,417 ) 63,736 656,158 Our share of net earnings (loss) (1) $ (353,946 ) 24,918 241,631 Our share of net earnings (loss) recognized (1) $ (362,899 ) (12,536 ) 133,814 Our cumulative share of net earnings deferred at November 30 $ 34,731 99,360 151,182 Our investments in unconsolidated entities $ 934,271 1,447,178 1,282,686 Equity of the unconsolidated entities $ 2,739,467 3,710,771 3,334,549 Our investment % in the unconsolidated entities 34.1 % 39.0 % 38.5 % (1) For the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, our share of net earnings (loss) recognized from unconsolidated entities includes $364.2 million and $126.4 million, respectively, of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of the unconsolidated entities. There were no SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of the unconsolidated entities for the year ended November 30, 2005. In February 2007, our LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. As part of the transaction, the joint venture obtained $1.6 billion of non recourse financing, which consisted of a $200 million five year Revolving Credit Facility, a $1.1 billion six year Term Loan B Facility and a $244 million seven year Second Lien Term Facility. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to us of $707.6 million. As a result, our ownership in LandSource was reduced to 16%. As a result of the recapitalization, we recognized a pretax financial statement gain of $175.9 million during the year ended November 30, 2007 and could potentially recognize additional profits in future years, in addition to profits from our continuing ownership interest. During the year ended November 30, 2007, we recognized $24.7 million of profit deferred at the time of the recapitalization of the LandSource joint venture in management fees and other income (expense), net. Option Contracts In our homebuilding operations, we have access to land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. These option deposits generally approximate 10% of the exercise price. Our option contracts sometimes include price escalators, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at time of the acquisition or is based on market value at the time of takedown. The exercise periods of our option contracts generally range from one to ten years. Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with SFAS 144. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment. Such declines could be caused by a 40 variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options. Some option contracts contain a predetermined take down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, we are not required to purchase land in accordance with those take down schedules. In substantially all instances, we have the right and ability to not exercise our option and forfeit our deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of our deposit and pre acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, we do not consider the take down price to be a firm contractual obligation. When we intend not to exercise an option, we write off any deposit and pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. For the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, we wrote off $530.0 million and $152.2 million, respectively, of option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 36,900 homesites and 24,200 homesites, respectively, under option that we do not intend to purchase. The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties (optioned) or unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have investments (JVs) (i.e., controlled homesites) for each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other at November 30, 2007 and 2006: November 30, 2007 Controlled Homesites OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites Optioned JVs Total East 14,888 14,091 28,979 24,014 52,993 Central 5,783 16,373 22,156 14,919 37,075 West 1,243 30,800 32,043 15,300 47,343 Other 963 1,729 2,692 8,568 11,260 Total homesites 22,877 62,993 85,870 62,801 148,671 November 30, 2006 Controlled Homesites OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites Optioned JVs Total East 42,733 17,898 60,631 36,169 96,800 Central 27,435 30,815 58,250 21,887 80,137 West 17,959 43,789 61,748 22,390 84,138 Other 6,631 2,019 8,650 11,879 20,529 Total homesites 94,758 94,521 189,279 92,325 281,604 We evaluated all option contracts for land when entered into or upon a reconsideration event to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, under FIN 46(R), if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, we are required to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, the effect of the consolidation entries associated with these option contracts was an increase of $345.3 million and $548.7 million, respectively, to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in our consolidated balance sheets as of November 30, 2007 and 2006. In addition, in 2007, we reclassified $525.0 million from inventory to consolidated inventory not owned as a result of the land transaction with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P. This increase was partially offset by the exercising of our options to acquire land under certain contracts previously consolidated under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R) and deconsolidation of certain option contracts, resulting in a net increase in consolidated inventory not owned of $447.3 million. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46R, we reclassified $65.6 million of related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2007. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non refundable deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $317.1 million and $785.9 million, respectively, and $193.3 million and $553.4 million, respectively, of letters of credit posted in lieu of cash deposits. 41 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2007: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years (In thousands) Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 2,295,436 90,229 610,105 249,516 1,345,586 Financial services Notes and other debts payable 541,437 541,306 95 25 11 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt* 682,886 136,619 222,109 170,123 154,035 Operating leases 201,213 71,053 78,673 37,924 13,563 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,720,972 839,207 910,982 457,588 1,513,195 * Interest commitments on variable interest bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of November 30, 2007. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2007, we had access to 85,870 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2007, we had $317.1 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and $193.3 million of letters of credit posted in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts. At November 30, 2007, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $814.4 million (including the $193.3 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Additionally, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects of $1.6 billion. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. We do not believe there will be any draws upon these bonds, but if there were any, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Our Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $1.2 billion at November 30, 2007. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers and builder commitments for loan programs totaled $209.7 million as of November 30, 2007. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or because borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS forward commitments, option contracts with investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and loan sales transactions with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At November 30, 2007, we had open commitments amounting to $281.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2008. The following sections discuss economic conditions, market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business: Economic Conditions Throughout 2007, market conditions in the homebuilding industry continued to deteriorate. This market deterioration was driven primarily by a decline in consumer confidence and increased volatility in the mortgage market, resulting in higher than normal cancellation rates (30% and 29%, respectively, in 2007 and 2006) and 42 lower net new orders (new orders were down 39% and 3%, respectively, in 2007 and 2006) for our company. Therefore, we made greater use of sales incentives ($48,000 per home delivered in 2007, compared to $32,000 per home delivered in 2006) to generate sales, which resulted in lower inventory levels. A continued decline in the prices for new homes could adversely affect our revenues and margins, as well as the carrying value of our inventory and other investments. Market and Financing Risk We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and borrowings under our warehouse lines of credit. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the option. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings are managed by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and, until 2007, limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. Due to deteriorating market conditions, we are currently focusing our efforts, in all quarters, on inventory management in order to deliver inventory and generate cash. Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs, along with a decrease in home sales price in 2007 compared to the appreciation in homes sales prices in previous years, have contributed to lower gross margins and significant inventory valuation adjustments. In recent years, the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides interpretive guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for us on December 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is expected to result in a charge of approximately $30 million to our retained earnings as of December 1, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for our financial assets and liabilities on December 1, 2007. The FASB has proposed a deferral of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that would delay implementation by us until December 1, 2008. SFAS 157 is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value, but may result in certain additional disclosures. In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums, (EITF 06 8). EITF 06 8 establishes that a company should evaluate the adequacy of the buyers continuing investment in determining whether to recognize profit under the percentage of completion method. EITF 06 8 is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2007. The adoption of EITF 06 8 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to 43 measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for us on December 1, 2007. We did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the consolidated financial statements. It also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parents ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2009. We will evaluate the impact the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. It broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations. SFAS 141R expands on required disclosures to improve the statement users abilities to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, (SFAS 66). Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review inventories for impairment during each reporting period on a community by community basis. SFAS 144 requires that if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value. In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins under sales contracts in backlog, projected 44 margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the fair value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review we identify communities whose carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. These projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. We generally use discount rates ranging from 15% to 20% depending on the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. For example, construction in progress inventory which is closer to completion will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development. We estimate fair values of inventory evaluated for impairment under SFAS 144 based on current market conditions and current assumptions made by management, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions change. For example, further market deterioration may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory, as well as on inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if further market deterioration occurs. We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. Our option contracts are recorded at cost. In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property that is the subject of the option. If we intend to walk away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and related pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, management projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $2.4 billion, $501.8 million and $20.5 million, respectively, of inventory adjustments, which included $747.8 million and $280.5 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2006, of valuation adjustments to finished homes, construction in progress and land on which we intend to build homes (no adjustments in 2005), $1.2 billion, $69.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, of valuation adjustments to land we intend to sell to third parties and $530.0 million, $152.2 million and $15.1 million, respectively, in 2007, 2006 and 2005 of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs. The $1.2 billion of valuation adjustments recorded in 2007 to land we intend to sell to third parties includes $740.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the portfolio of land we sold to our strategic land investment venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan 45 Stanley & Co., Inc., which was formed in November 2007. The valuation adjustments were calculated based on current market conditions and current assumptions made by management, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions change. See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and homebuilding other. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2007, the reserve for warranty costs was $164.8 million. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We frequently invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FIN 46R, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. Management uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2007, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2007, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $9.1 billion and total liabilities of $6.3 billion. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with APB 18. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying value over its estimated fair value. The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes two critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities and (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the unconsolidated entities. Such inventory is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated 46 entities in accordance with SFAS 144. The unconsolidated entities generally use discount rates ranging from 15% to 20% in their SFAS 144 reviews for impairment. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity in accordance with SFAS 144, our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities. In certain instances, we may be required to record additional losses relating to our investment in unconsolidated entities under APB 18; such losses are included in management fees and other income (expense), net. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived. We believe our assumptions on discount rates are also critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates also affects the estimated fair value of our investment in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investment in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of its investment in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, we recorded $496.4 million and $140.9 million, respectively, of adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities, which included $364.2 million and $126.4 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2006, of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of the unconsolidated investments and $132.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively, in 2007 and 2006, of valuation adjustments to investments in unconsolidated entities in accordance with APB 18. We did not record any adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities related to SFAS 144 valuation adjustments or APB 18 during 2005. These valuation adjustments were calculated based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions change. See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and homebuilding other. Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, and gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates of the policies. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Interest income on loans held for sale and loans held for investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. In all circumstances, we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Allowance for Loan and Other Losses We provide an allowance for loan losses by taking into consideration various factors such as past loan loss experience, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2007, the allowance for loan losses was $11.1 million, compared to $1.8 million at November 30, 2006. While we believe that the 2007 year end allowance is adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market on a non recourse basis within 60 days after we originate them, remaining liable for certain representations and warranties, there can be no assurances that further deterioration in the housing market, future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher occurrence of loan charge offs. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. 47 We provide an allowance for estimated title and escrow losses based upon managements evaluation of claims presented and estimates for any incurred but not reported claims. The allowance is established at a level that management estimates to be sufficient to satisfy those claims where a loss is determined to be probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The allowance for title and escrow losses for both known and incurred but not reported claims is considered by management to be adequate for such purposes. Homebuilding and Financial Services Operations Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis. Inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or whenever indicators of impairment exist) for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142). The continued deterioration in market conditions as a result of tightening mortgage credit standards and other factors led to SFAS 144 and APB 18 impairments and a significant decline in our market capitalization; thus, we reviewed goodwill for impairment in both our third and fourth quarters of 2007. During the third quarter of 2007, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $16.5 million related to our homebuilding operations. Our third quarter goodwill impairment charge related primarily to specific acquisitions made during the peak homebuilding years (2003 to 2005) in Homebuilding Other and the Homebuilding Central reportable segment. To the extent goodwill resulted from acquisitions during the peak homebuilding years, it increased the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge at those reporting units due to the premium values we paid for the respective land positions of such acquired companies. Conversely, to the extent that goodwill resulted from acquisitions prior to the peak homebuilding years, it decreased the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge in those divisions because there could be significant declines in values without reducing the fair values of the companies below what they were when the companies were acquired. In addition, both Homebuilding Other and the Homebuilding Central reportable segment have generally underperformed in comparison to the Homebuilding East and Homebuilding West reportable segments. We also performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2007 and wrote off the remaining recorded goodwill of $173.7 million related to our homebuilding operations. The goodwill impairment related to our homebuilding operations in the fourth quarter was due to a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units subsequent to our third quarter, which resulted from significant deterioration in market conditions and a decrease in our stock price during that period. Our Financial Services segment goodwill has not been impaired. We did not record impairment charges during the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. As of November 30, 2007 and 2006, there were no material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill. We use an equally weighted combination of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting units when performing our impairment test of goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142. The income approach establishes fair value by methods which discount or capitalize earnings and or cash flow by a discount or capitalization rate that reflects market rate of return expectations, market conditions and the risk of the relative investment. We use a discounted cash flow method when applying the income approach. This analysis includes operating income, interest expense, taxes, incremental working capital and long term debt, as well as other factors. The projections used in the analysis are for a five year period and represent what we consider to be normalized earnings. The market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold. Two methods are commonly considered under the market approach. The market comparison method is based on the stock prices of guideline publicly traded companies that are in the same industry as the company being valued, while the comparative transaction method is based on the actual sale of similar companies. We use the market comparison method when 48 applying the market approach, due to the availability of information relative to our companys guideline companies and the lack of recent sales of similar companies. Using the market comparison method, we performed qualitative and quantitative analysis on each of our guideline companies, including evaluating their market capitalization, to assess their strengths and weaknesses and compared them to our company. After assessing the risk differences, we estimated the guideline company multiples to properly reflect the risk profile of our company. After review of the guideline companies as compared to our company and completing an analysis based on both the equity method of valuation and the invested capital method of valuation, we concluded that the invested capital method of valuation was a reasonable basis for estimating our companys fair value. One of the primary factors in our determination to use the invested capital method of valuation was the fact that our capital structure appeared to have less debt as a percentage of capital than the guideline companies selected. In determining the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach, our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions. The most significant assumptions affecting our expected cash flows are the discount rate, projected revenue growth rate and operating profit margin. There are also various assumptions used under the market approach that affect the valuation of our reporting units. The most significant assumptions are the market multiples and control premium. In estimating the fair value of our company under the market approach, we used two key multiples: 1) market value of invested capital to book value of capital and 2) market value of invested capital to revenues. A control premium represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company. As noted above, we use an equally weighted combination of the income and market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units. We assign an equal weight to the respective methods as they are both acceptable valuation approaches in determining the fair value of a business, and they both attempt to consider the entire value of a business from either an income stream or comparable market value. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, goodwill was $61.2 million and $257.8 million, respectively. Our goodwill of $61.2 million at November 30, 2007 relates to our Financial Services segment. We wrote off our entire homebuilding goodwill and only have $61.2 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet related to our Financial Services segment, whose fair value using an equally weighted combination of the income and market approach exceeded the carrying value of the segments net assets by approximately $225 million as of November 30, 2007. Therefore, the impact of a change in our significant underlying assumptions +/ 1% would not result in a materially different fair value. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, (SFAS 109) requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are assessed periodically based on the SFAS 109 more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that while we have incurred a cumulative loss over our evaluation period, a substantial loss was incurred in the current year. However, a substantial portion of the current loss was the result of the difficult current market conditions that led to the impairments of certain tangible assets as well as goodwill. Consideration has also been given to the lengthy period over which these net deferred tax assets can be realized, and our history of not having Federal tax loss carryforwards expire unused. 49 We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates, we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, our net deferred tax asset was $746.9 million and $307.2 million, respectively. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. If results are less than projected and there is no objectively verifiable evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax asset, a substantial valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets. However, currently no valuation allowance has been established for our deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in the future. Share Based Payments We have share based awards outstanding under four different plans which provide for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock (nonvested shares) to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the plans may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant. Prior to December 1, 2005, we accounted for stock option awards granted under our share based payment plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) and related Interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (SFAS 123). Share based employee compensation expense was not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations prior to December 1, 2005, as all stock option awards granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Effective December 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized during 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to December 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. The impact of SFAS 123R on diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006 was $0.08 per share and $0.11 per share, respectively. We believe that the accounting estimate for share based payments is a critical accounting estimate because the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require managements judgments. These estimates include the fair value of each of our stock option awards, which are estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model as discussed in Note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this document. The fair value of our stock option awards, which are subject to graded vesting, is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options. Expected volatility is based on an average of (1) historical volatility of our stock and (2) implied volatility from traded options on our stock. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award granted. We use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model. The expected life of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we presented all tax benefits related to deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS 123R requires that cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) be classified as financing cash flows. 50 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The table on the following page provides information at November 30, 2007 about our significant financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For loans held for sale, loans held for investment and investments held to maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values at November 30, 2007. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2007. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk. 51 Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2007 Years Ending November 30, Thereafter Total Fair Value atNovember 30,2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (Dollars in millions) ASSETS Financial services: Loans held for sale, net: Fixed rate $ 281.5 281.5 281.5 Average interest rate 6.1 % 6.1 % Variable rate $ 12.0 12.0 12.0 Average interest rate 6.4 % 6.4 % Loans held for investment and investments held to maturity: Fixed rate $ 162.7 5.5 4.5 0.5 0.6 17.9 191.7 192.4 Average interest rate 1.8 % 9.3 % 6.9 % 9.8 % 9.8 % 9.4 % 2.9 % Variable rate $ 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 6.9 7.3 6.8 Average interest rate 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % LIABILITIES Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 32.5 281.6 299.8 249.5 1,345.6 2,209.0 1,819.1 Average interest rate 2.3 % 7.6 % 5.1 % 6.0 % 5.8 % 5.9 % Variable rate $ 57.7 22.9 5.8 86.4 86.4 Average interest rate 7.3 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 7.6 % Financial services: Notes and other debts payable: Variable rate $ 541.3 0.1 541.4 541.4 Average interest rate 5.5 % 6.9 % 5.5 % 52 Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2007. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2007 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein. 53 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of November 30, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2007 of the Company and our report dated January 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Certified Public Accountants Miami, Florida January 29, 2008 54
