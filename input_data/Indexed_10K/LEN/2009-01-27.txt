Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements, except as required by Federal securities laws. Outlook The housing market continues to be compromised by the most significant domestic economic downturn in recent history. General economic pressures continue to drive down the volume and prices of homes being sold, as rising levels of foreclosures add inventory to an already saturated marketplace. Overall consumer sentiment has continued to deteriorate, resulting in fewer potential home purchasers willing to enter the market. These conditions have fostered a competitive need amongst homebuilders to drive pricing downward through the use of incentives, price reductions and incentivized brokerage fees. Although there is optimism that the new administration taking federal office will offer stimulus to fix the sliding housing environment, we currently do not have visibility as to when these deteriorating market conditions will subside. Whether or not there is additional federal stimulus, there could be further deterioration in market conditions, which may lead to additional valuation adjustments in the future. In midst of this environment, we remained balance sheet focused with great emphasis on liquidity and positioning ourselves for future opportunities. We continued to reduce overhead in an effort to be right sized for anticipated lower volume levels in fiscal 2009. In addition, we continued to carefully manage our inventory levels through curtailing land purchases, reducing home starts and adjusting prices to deliver completed homes. We also have diligently worked on restructuring, repositioning and reducing our joint ventures. We have reduced the number of joint ventures in which we participate to 116 unconsolidated joint ventures at November 30, 2008, compared to 270 unconsolidated joint ventures at the peak in 2006. We have also reduced our net recourse indebtedness exposure with regard to joint ventures to $392.5 million at November 30, 2008, compared to $1.1 billion at the peak in 2006. In 2009, cash generation will continue to be our top priority. We will convert inventory to cash and reduce both our land purchases and homebuilding starts. In addition, we will reduce our cash outflows by continuing to right size our overhead to improve our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. Results of Operations Overview Our net loss in 2008 was $1.1 billion, or $7.00 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $12.31 per basic and diluted share, in 2007. The current year net loss was attributable to weakness in the housing market that has persisted during 2008 and has impacted all of our operations. Our gross margin percentage increased due to our lower inventory basis and continued focus on repositioning our product and reducing construction costs, despite Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long lived Assets, (SFAS 144) valuation adjustments and a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered during 2008, compared to 2007. Our 2008 results were also impacted by a non cash SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, (SFAS 109) valuation allowance of $730.8 million, or $4.61 per basic and diluted share, recorded against our deferred tax assets. 22 Table of Contents The following table sets forth financial and operational information for the years indicated related to our operations. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during 2006 were not material to our consolidated financial statements and are included in the tables since the respective dates of the acquisitions.

(2) Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and operating margin as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments are non GAAP financial measures disclosed by certain of our competitors and have been presented because we find it useful in evaluating our performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors. 2008 versus 2007 Revenues from home sales decreased 56% in the year ended November 30, 2008 to $4.2 billion from $9.5 billion in 2007. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 51% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 9% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2008. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 15,344 homes in the year ended November 30, 2008 from 31,582 homes last year. In the year ended November 30, 2008, new home deliveries were lower in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2007. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $270,000 in the year ended November 30, 2008 from $297,000 in 2007, due to reduced pricing. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $48,700 and $48,000 per home delivered, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007. 23 Table of Contents Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $705.1 million, or 17.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to $1.3 billion, or 13.9%, in 2007. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, improved compared to last year primarily due to our lower inventory basis and continued focus on repositioning our product and reducing construction costs. Gross margins on home sales were $509.6 million, or 12.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $195.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $570.7 million, or 6.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $747.8 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of our competitors and has been presented because we find it useful in evaluating our performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $130.4 million in 2008, compared to $203.7 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from lower average debt during 2008, as well as decreased deliveries during 2008, compared to 2007. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2008 was 49.2%, compared to 37.5% as of November 30, 2007. Our net homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2008 was 35.7% compared to 30.2% as of November 30, 2007. The net homebuilding debt to total capital ratio consists of net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity). Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $713.1 million, or 52%, in the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to last year, primarily due to the consolidation of divisions, which resulted in reductions in associate headcount, variable selling expense and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 15.8% in the year ended November 30, 2008, from 14.5% in 2007, due to lower revenues. Losses on land sales totaled $133.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $47.8 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $97.2 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to approximately 8,200 homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase. In the year ended November 30, 2007, losses on land sales totaled $1,661.1 million, which included $1,167.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $530.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to approximately 36,900 homesites that were under option. Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $59.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $32.2 million of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $362.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $364.2 million of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Management fees and other income (expense), net totaled ($200.0) million in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $172.8 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities and $25.0 million of write offs of notes receivable, compared to management fees and other income (expense), net of ($76.0) million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $132.2 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. Minority interest income (expense), net was $4.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to minority interest income (expense), net of ($1.9) million in the year ended November 30, 2007. Due to the termination of our rights to purchase certain assets from our LandSource unconsolidated joint venture, we recognized deferred profit of $101.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2008 (net of $31.8 million of write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs and other write offs) related to the 2007 recapitalization of LandSource. Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income (expense), net and minority interest income (expense), net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating loss for the Financial Services segment was $31.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to operating earnings of $6.1 million in the same period last year. The decline in profitability was 24 Table of Contents primarily due to a goodwill impairment of $27.2 million related to the segments mortgage operations and fewer transactions in the segments title and mortgage operations. Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $43.5 million, or 25%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to 2007. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 2.8% in the year ended November 30, 2008, from 1.7% in the same period last year, due to lower revenues. SFAS 109 requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. As a result of our operational results for the year ended November 30, 2008, we have now incurred cumulative losses over the evaluation period we established in accordance with SFAS 109. Accordingly, based on our evaluation of available evidence including our cumulative losses in the evaluation period, our current level of profits and losses and current market conditions, we have recorded a $730.8 million non cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during the year ended November 30, 2008. In future periods, this valuation allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of the our deferred tax assets will be realized. At November 30, 2008, we owned 74,681 homesites and had access to an additional 38,589 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2008, 2% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 1,599 homes ($456.3 million) at November 30, 2008, compared to 4,009 homes ($1,384.1 million) at November 30, 2007. The lower backlog was attributable to challenged market conditions that persisted throughout 2008, which resulted in lower new orders in 2008, compared to 2007. 2007 versus 2006 Revenues from home sales decreased 36% in the year ended November 30, 2007 to $9.5 billion from $14.9 billion in 2006. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 33% decrease in the number of home deliveries and a 6% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2007. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 31,582 homes in the year ended November 30, 2007 from 47,032 homes in 2006. In the year ended November 30, 2007, new home deliveries were lower in each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2006. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $297,000 in the year ended November 30, 2007 from $315,000 in 2006, primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers ($48,000 per home delivered in 2007, compared to $32,000 per home delivered in 2006). Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $1.3 billion, or 13.9%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to $3.0 billion, or 20.3%, in 2006. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to 2006 in all of our homebuilding segments primarily due to higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. Gross margins on home sales were $570.7 million, or 6.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $747.8 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $2,740.4 million, or 18.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2006, which included $280.5 million of SFAS 144 inventory valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure disclosed by certain of our competitors and has been presented because we find it useful in evaluating its performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors. Homebuilding interest expense (primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold) was $203.7 million in 2007, compared to $241.1 million in 2006. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from lower average debt during 2007, as well as decreased deliveries during 2007, compared to 2006. Our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2007 was 37.5%, compared to 31.4% as of November 30, 2006. Our net homebuilding debt to total capital ratio as of November 30, 2007 was 30.2% compared to 25.5% as of November 30, 2006. The net homebuilding debt to total capital ratio consists of net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity). Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $396.6 million, or 22%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount and variable selling expenses. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 14.5% in the year ended November 30, 2007, from 11.9% in 2006. The 260 basis point increase was primarily due to lower revenues. 25 Table of Contents Loss on land sales totaled $1,661.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $740.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments on the inventory acquired by the Morgan Stanley land investment venture discussed below, $426.9 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $530.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 36,900 homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase. In the year ended November 30, 2006, loss on land sales totaled $30.0 million, which included $69.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments and $152.2 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 24,200 homesites that were under option. In November 2007, we and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., formed a strategic land investment venture to acquire, develop, manage and sell residential real estate. We acquired a 20% ownership interest and 50% voting rights in the land investment venture. Concurrent with the formation of the land investment venture, we sold a diversified portfolio of our land to the venture for $525 million. The properties acquired by the new entity consist of approximately 11,000 homesites in 32 communities located throughout the country. The properties sold by us had a net book value of approximately $1.3 billion. As part of the transaction, we entered into option agreements and obtained rights of first offer providing us the opportunity to purchase certain finished homesites. The exercise price of the options is based on a fixed percentage of the future home price. We have no obligation to exercise these options and cannot acquire a majority of the entitys assets. We are managing the land investment ventures operations and receive fees for our services. We will also receive disproportionate distributions if the investment venture exceeds certain financial targets. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory remained on our balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned as of November 30, 2007. Additionally, the $445 million of net cash received from the transaction was recorded in liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the consolidated balance sheet and classified as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a SFAS 144 valuation adjustment of $740.4 million on the inventory sold to the land investment venture. Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $362.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $364.2 million of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the assets of our investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $12.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, which included $126.4 million of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the assets of our investments in unconsolidated entities. During the year ended November 30, 2007, we recorded goodwill impairments of $190.2 million related to our homebuilding operations. Management fees and other income (expense), net, totaled ($76.0) million in the year ended November 30, 2007, which included $132.2 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities, compared to management fees and other income (expense), net, of $66.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2006, net of $14.5 million of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. Minority interest income (expense), net was ($1.9) million and ($13.4) million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006. Sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income (expense), net and minority interest income (expense), net may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. In February 2007, our LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. As part of the transaction, the joint venture obtained $1.6 billion of non recourse financing, which consisted of a $200 million five year Revolving Credit Facility, a $1.1 billion six year Term Loan B Facility and a $244 million seven year Second Lien Term Facility. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to us of $707.6 million, but reduced our resulting ownership of LandSource to 16%. As a result of the recapitalization, we recognized a pretax gain of $175.9 million in 2007. Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $6.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to $149.8 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in profitability from both the segments mortgage and title operations and $28.4 million of partial write offs of land seller notes receivable. 26 Table of Contents The decline in profitability was due to the overall weakness in the housing market, which led to a decrease in volume and transactions for the mortgage and title operations compared to 2006. Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $20.1 million, or 10%, in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to 2006. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 1.7% in the year ended November 30, 2007, compared to 1.2% in 2006, primarily due to lower revenues. At November 30, 2007, we owned 62,801 homesites and had access to an additional 85,870 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2007, 5% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 4,009 homes ($1.4 billion) at November 30, 2007, compared to 11,608 homes ($4.0 billion) at November 30, 2006. The lower backlog was attributable to weak market conditions that persisted during 2007, which resulted in lower new orders in 2007, compared to 2006. Homebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations also purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures. We have disaggregated our Houston homebuilding division from our Homebuilding Central reportable segment and have presented Houston as a separate reportable segment due to the division achieving a quantitative threshold set forth in SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (SFAS 131) as of and for the year ended November 30, 2008. All segment information related to prior years has been restated to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. The change in reportable segments has no effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Information about homebuilding activities in states in which our homebuilding activities are not economically similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other. References in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those reportable segments.

Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced cancellation rates in our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other as follows: Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 Cancellation Rates East 31 % 34 % 32 % Central 22 % 29 % 29 % West 24 % 29 % 30 % Houston 27 % 32 % 24 % Other 23 % 20 % 22 % Total 26 % 30 % 29 % During the fourth quarter of 2008, our cancellation rate was 32%. Although we continued to experience a higher than normal cancellation rate during 2008, we remained focused on reselling these homes, which, in many instances, included the use of sales incentives (discussed below as a percentage of revenues from home sales) to avoid the build up of excess inventory. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners, except for our multi level residential buildings under construction for which revenue was recognized under percentage of completion accounting during 2006 and 2007. In 2008, we stopped recognizing revenues and expenses under percentage of completion accounting for our multi level residential buildings under construction as a result of Emerging Issues Task Force 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums (EITF 06 8) (see Note 1 in Item 8 of this Report). 2008 versus 2007 East: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries and in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales excluding SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were $241.3 million, or 19.3%, in 2008, compared to $368.0 million, or 13.7%, in 2007. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased compared to last year due to our lower inventory basis and continued focus on reducing costs. As a percentage of home sales revenues, sales incentives were 17.2% in 2008 and 16.9% in 2007. Gross margins on home sales were $164.5 million, or 13.1% in 2008 including SFAS 144 valuation adjustments of $76.8 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $89.0 million, or 3.3%, in 2007 including $279.1 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments. Losses on land sales were $41.2 million in 2008 (including $19.0 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $23.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments), compared to losses on land sales of $400.8 million in 2007 (including $119.6 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $307.5 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments).

Gross margins on home sales were $31.8 million, or 6.2% in 2008 including SFAS 144 valuation adjustments of $28.1 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $102.0 million, or 6.6%, in 2007 including $91.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments.

Other: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in Homebuilding Other, and a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in this segment except in Minnesota.

Substantially all of the loans the Financial Services segment originates are sold in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis; although, we remain liable for certain limited representations. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services segment. The results of operations of companies we acquired during 2006 were not material to our consolidated financial statements and are included in the table since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 312,379 456,529 643,622 Costs and expenses (1) 343,369 450,409 493,819 Operating earnings (loss) (1) $ (30,990 ) 6,120 149,803 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 4,290,000 7,740,000 10,480,000 Number of mortgages originated 18,300 30,900 41,800 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 85 % 73 % 66 % Number of title and closing service transactions 105,900 136,300 161,300 Number of title policies issued 96,700 146,200 195,700 (1) Financial Services costs and expenses and operating loss for the year ended November 30, 2008 include a $27.2 million impairment of goodwill. During 2007 and 2008, concern in the mortgage market about a likely increase in defaults (which, in fact, has occurred) led to tightening lending standards, which among other things, has resulted in a significant decline in the availability of sub prime loans (loans to persons with a FICO score under 620) and Alt A loans (loans to persons with FICO scores of 620 or more who do not have conventional documentation of their incomes or net worths). Because we sell all the loans we originate, we had to conform our lending standards to the tightened industry standards. This reduced the number of persons who qualified for loans from us. During the year ended November 30, 2008, the number of sub prime and Alt A loans made by our Financial Services segment to purchasers of our homes were negligible, compared to approximately 2% and 29%, respectively, of sub prime and Alt A loans made during the year ended November 30, 2007. Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents related to our homebuilding and financial services operations of $1,203.4 million, compared to $795.2 million at November 30, 2007. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and our warehouse lines of credit. Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2008 and 2007, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $1,100.8 million and $444.5 million, respectively. During 2008, cash flows provided by operating activities included a decrease in our inventory as a result of reduced land purchases, a reduction in construction in progress resulting from lower new home starts and write offs and valuation adjustments pertaining to the respective inventory. In order to improve liquidity in 2008, we continued to focus our efforts on adjusting pricing to meet market conditions, as we pulled back production and curtailed land purchases where possible in order to keep our balance sheet positioned for future opportunities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were also impacted by a decrease in our receivables primarily related to the collection of our income tax receivables, a decrease in loans held for sale resulting from a decrease in our new home deliveries during the year and our deferred income tax provision. Cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by our net loss and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities primarily due to a decrease in our land purchases. 34 Table of Contents During 2007, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of the change in inventories including inventory write offs and valuation adjustments, our equity in loss from unconsolidated entities including our share of valuation adjustments related to assets of the unconsolidated entities, partially offset by our net loss, a deferred income tax benefit and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities. Investing Cash Flow Activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $265.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $307.0 million in 2007. During the year ended November 30, 2008, we contributed $403.7 million of cash to unconsolidated entities, compared to $608.0 million in 2007. Our investing activities also included distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $87.8 million and $542.3 million, respectively, during the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007. During 2007, we received distributions of $354.6 million in excess of our investment in LandSource due to its recapitalization. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. However, at November 30, 2008, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions. Financing Cash Flow Activities During 2008, our financing cash flow activities primarily related to net repayments under financial services debt, principal payments on other borrowings and dividends paid, partially offset by receipts related to minority interests. During 2007, we sold a diversified portfolio of land to our land investment joint venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P. for $525 million. As part of the transaction, we entered into option agreements and obtained rights of first offer, providing us the opportunity to purchase certain finished homesites. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory remained on our balance sheet as of November 30, 2007. As a result of the transaction in 2007, we received $445 million of cash (net of our deposit on the homesites under option and our invested contribution to the land investment venture). During 2008, we exercised certain land option contracts from the land investment venture, reducing the liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet related to consolidated inventory not owned by $48.4 million. Homebuilding debt to total capital and net homebuilding debt to total capital are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. Management believes providing a measure of leverage of our homebuilding operations enables readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance and we find it useful in evaluating our performance. Homebuilding debt to total capital and net homebuilding debt to total capital are calculated as follows: November 30, 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Homebuilding debt $ 2,544,935 2,295,436 Stockholders equity 2,623,007 3,822,119 Total capital $ 5,167,942 6,117,555 Homebuilding debt to total capital 49.2 % 37.5 % Homebuilding debt $ 2,544,935 2,295,436 Less: Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents 1,091,468 642,467 Net homebuilding debt $ 1,453,467 1,652,969 Net homebuilding debt to total capital (1) 35.7 % 30.2 % (1) Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity). At November 30, 2008, homebuilding debt to total capital was higher compared to prior year because of the decrease in stockholders equity primarily due to our net loss as a result of inventory valuation adjustments, 35 Table of Contents write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs, SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities, APB 18 valuation adjustments to investments in unconsolidated entities and a SFAS 109 valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, all of which are non cash items. At November 30, 2008, net homebuilding debt to total capital was higher compared to November 30, 2007 due to a decrease in stockholders equity despite an increase in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of $449.0 million. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock. The following table summarizes our homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) 7 5/8% senior notes due 2009 $ 280,976 279,491 5.125% senior notes due 2010 299,877 299,825 5.95% senior notes due 2011 249,615 249,516 5.95% senior notes due 2013 346,851 346,268 5.50% senior notes due 2014 248,088 247,806 5.60% senior notes due 2015 501,618 501,804 6.50% senior notes due 2016 249,733 249,708 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 368,177 121,018 $ 2,544,935 2,295,436 Our average debt outstanding was $2.3 billion in 2008, compared to $3.1 billion in 2007. The average rate for interest incurred was 5.8% in 2008 and 2007. Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt for the year ended November 30, 2008 was $148.3 million, compared to $199.1 million in 2007. The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility consists of a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2011. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility are limited by a borrowing base calculation, consisting of specified percentages of various types of our assets. Under the Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 55% for the fourth quarter of 2008 and our 2009 fiscal year and a leverage ratio of 52.5% for our 2010 and 2011 fiscal years. If our minimum tangible net worth, as defined by our Credit Facility, goes below $1.6 billion, our Credit Facility would be reduced from $1.1 billion to $0.9 billion. In no event can our minimum tangible net worth, as defined by our Credit Facility, be less than $1.3 billion. At November 30, 2008, we believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants. In addition to other requirements, the Credit Facility limits our investments in joint ventures and requires us to effect quarterly reductions of our maximum recourse exposure related to joint ventures in which we have investments by a total of $200 million by November 30, 2009 of which we have already made significant progress. We must also effect quarterly reductions during our 2010 fiscal year totaling $180 million and during the first six months of our 2011 fiscal year totaling $80 million. By May 31, 2011, our maximum recourse exposure related joint ventures in which we have investments cannot exceed $275 million. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are LIBOR based, with margins determined based on changes in our credit ratings, or an alternate base rate, as described in the credit agreement. During the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, the average daily borrowings under the Credit Facility were $21.3 million and $143.2 million, respectively. At both November 30, 2008 and 2007, we had no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility. However, at November 30, 2008 and 2007, $275.2 million and $443.5 million, respectively, of our total letters of credit outstanding discussed below, were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Our performance letters of credit outstanding were $167.5 millions and $390.2 million, respectively, at November 30, 2008 and 2007. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were $278.5 million and $424.2 million, 36 Table of Contents respectively, at November 30, 2008 and 2007. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, and financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. In June 2007, we redeemed our $300 million senior floating rate notes due 2009. The redemption price was $300.0 million, or 100% of the principal amount of the outstanding notes due 2009, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. In November 2006, we redeemed our $200 million senior floating rate notes due 2007. The redemption price was $200.0 million, or 100% of the principal amount of outstanding notes due 2007, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. In April 2006, substantially all of our outstanding 5.125% zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021, (the Convertible Notes) were converted by the noteholders into 4.9 million Class A common shares. The Convertible Notes were convertible at a rate of 14.2 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. Convertible Notes not converted by the noteholders were not material and were redeemed by us on April 4, 2006. The redemption price was $468.10 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented the original issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the redemption date. In April 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and $250 million of 6.50% senior notes due 2016 (collectively, the New Senior Notes) at prices of 99.766% and 99.873%, respectively, in a private placement under SEC Rule 144A. Proceeds from the offering of the New Senior Notes, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $248.7 million and $248.9 million, respectively. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the New Senior Notes is due semi annually. The New Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, and substantially all of our subsidiaries guarantee the New Senior Notes. In October 2006, we completed an exchange offer of the New Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Exchange Notes), with substantially all of the New Senior Notes being exchanged for the Exchange Notes. At November 30, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amount of the Exchange Notes was $499.3 million and $499.2 million, respectively. In September 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.125% senior notes due 2010 (the 5.125% Senior Notes) at a price of 99.905% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $298.2 million. We added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is due semi annually. The 5.125% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries guaranteed the 5.125% Senior Notes. In 2006, we exchanged the 5.125% Senior Notes for registered notes. The registered notes have substantially identical terms as the 5.125% Senior Notes, except that the registered notes do not include transfer restrictions that are applicable to the 5.125% Senior Notes. At November 30, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amount of the 5.125% Senior Notes was $299.9 million and $299.8 million, respectively. In April 2005, we sold $300 million of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2015 (the Senior Notes) at a price of 99.771%. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $297.5 million. In July 2005, we sold $200 million of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2015 at a price of 101.407%. The Senior Notes were the same issue as the Senior Notes we sold in April 2005. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $203.9 million. We added the proceeds of both offerings to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi annually. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of our subsidiaries guaranteed the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for identical Senior Notes that had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. At November 30, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amount of the Senior Notes sold in April and July 2005 was $501.6 million and $501.8 million, respectively. Substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries have guaranteed all our Senior Notes (the Guaranteed Notes). The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly and indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The principal reason our wholly owned subsidiaries guaranteed the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time, however, when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, the 37 Table of Contents guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Currently, the only debt the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing other than the Guaranteed Notes is Lennar Corporations principal revolving bank credit line (currently the Credit Facility). Therefore, if, the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under its principal revolving bank credit line and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes. If the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing a revolving credit line totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit line is less than $75 million. Because it is possible that our banks will permit some or all of the guarantor subsidiaries to stop guaranteeing our revolving credit line, it is possible that, at some time or times in the future, the Guaranteed Notes will no longer be guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries. At November 30, 2008, our Financial Services segment had a syndicated warehouse repurchase facility, which matures in April 2009 ($125 million, plus a $50 million temporary accordion feature that expired in December 2008) and a warehouse repurchase facility, which matures in June 2009 ($150 million). Our Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and expects both facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. At November 30, 2008 and 2007, borrowings under the lines of credit were $209.5 million and $505.4 million, respectively, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded by investors with outstanding principal balances of $286.7 million and $540.9 million, respectively, at November 30, 2008 and 2007. These facilities have several interest rate pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The combined effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2008 was 3.5%. At November 30, 2008 and 2007, our Financial Services segment had advances under a different conduit funding agreement totaling $10.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively, which had an effective interest rate of 2.9% and 5.8%, respectively, at November 30, 2008 and 2007. During 2008, our Financial Services segment entered into a new on going 60 day committed repurchase facility for $75 million. As of November 30, 2008, it had advances under this facility totaling $5.2 million, which had an effective interest rate of 3.7%. Our Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Financial Services segment enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. Changes in Capital Structure In June 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to permit the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During 2008 and 2007, there were no material share repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2006, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock under the stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price including commissions of $320.1 million, or $51.59 per share. As of November 30, 2008, 6.2 million shares of common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program. Treasury stock increased by 0.5 million Class A common shares and 0.8 million Class A common shares during the years ended November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, primarily related to forfeitures of restricted stock. In addition to the common shares purchased under our stock repurchase program during the year ended November 30, 2006, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million Class A common shares related to the vesting of restricted stock and distribution of common stock from our deferred compensation plan. In October 2008, the Companys Board of Directors voted to decrease the annual dividend rate with regard to the Companys Class A and Class B common stock to $0.16 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly). During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Class A and Class B common stockholders received per share annual dividends of $0.52, $0.64 and $0.64, respectively. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity. 38 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Investments in Unconsolidated Entities At November 30, 2008, we had equity investments in 116 unconsolidated entities, compared to 214 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2007. Due to current market conditions, we are focused on continuing to reduce the number of unconsolidated entities that we have investments in. Our investments in unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows: November 30, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Land development $ 633,652 738,481 Homebuilding 133,100 195,790 Total investment $ 766,752 934,271 During 2008, as homebuilding market conditions remained challenged, we recorded $32.2 million of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, compared to $364.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2007. In addition, we recorded $172.8 million and $132.2 million, respectively, of APB 18 valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007. We will continue to monitor our investments in joint ventures and the recoverability of assets owned by those joint ventures. We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Through these entities, we primarily seek to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures are land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers give us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partner. Joint ventures with other homebuilders provide us with the ability to bid jointly with our partner for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners allow us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners allow us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners. Although the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures partners vary, the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire, develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time. The joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. The capital contributions usually coincide in time with the acquisition of properties by the joint venture. Additionally, most joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment or maintenance guarantees generally is required. Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Our equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of joint ventures earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyer. In some instances, we are designated as the manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts generally require us to make deposits using 39 Table of Contents cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits generally approximate 10% of the exercise price. We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. Joint ventures in which we have investments are subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business. As discussed above, the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities. In many instances, the debt financing is non recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guarantees. Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the joint venture participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other joint venture participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes. The joint ventures often enter into option agreements with buyers, which may include us or other joint venture participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements. As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint ventures activities and the stage in the joint ventures life cycle. We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our joint ventures. For purposes of classifying distributions received from joint ventures in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities. At November 30, 2008, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $7.8 billion and total liabilities of $5.1 billion, which included $4.1 billion of debt. These unconsolidated entities usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. As of November 30, 2008, our equity in these unconsolidated entities represented 29% of the entities total equity, down from 34% at November 30, 2007. Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt to different unconsolidated entities. Some unconsolidated entities own multiple properties and other assets. We also do not use our investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt in another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among our unconsolidated entities. In connection with a loan to an unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any, or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of unauthorized transfer or 40 Table of Contents bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee). In connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity where there is a joint and several guarantee, we generally have a reimbursement agreement with our partner. The reimbursement agreement provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee. However, if our joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The summary of our net recourse exposure related to the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was as follows: November 30, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Several recourse debt repayment $ 78,547 123,022 Several recourse debt maintenance 167,941 355,513 Joint and several recourse debt repayment 138,169 263,364 Joint and several recourse debt maintenance 123,051 291,727 Land seller debt recourse exposure 12,170 Our maximum recourse exposure 519,878 1,033,626 Less joint and several reimbursement agreements with our partners (127,428 ) (238,692 ) Our net recourse exposure $ 392,450 794,934 The recourse debt exposure in the table above represents our maximum exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral. Although we, in some instances, guarantee the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment, our unconsolidated entities that have recourse debt have a significant amount of assets and equity. The summarized balance sheets of our unconsolidated entities with recourse debt were as follows: November 30, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Assets $ 2,846,819 3,220,695 Liabilities 1,565,148 2,311,216 Equity 1,281,671 909,479 In addition, we and or our partners sometimes guarantee the obligations of an unconsolidated entity in order to help secure a loan to that entity. When we and or our partners provide guarantees, the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment may constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes. During the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, amounts paid under our maintenance guarantees were $74.0 million and $84.1 million, respectively. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, as of November 30, 2008, the fair values of the maintenance guarantees and repayment guarantees were not material. We believe that as of November 30, 2008, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligations of an unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, most of the time the collateral should be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In many of the loans to unconsolidated entities, we and another entity or entities generally related to our subsidiarys joint venture partner(s), have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those 41 Table of Contents completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction was to be done in phases, very often the guarantee is to complete only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used. Under many of the completion guarantees, the guarantors are permitted, under certain circumstances, to use undisbursed loan proceeds to satisfy the completion of obligations, and in many of those cases, the guarantors only pay interest on those funds, with no repayment of the principal of such funds required. In certain circumstances, we have placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for our joint ventures. The total debt of the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was as follows: November 30, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Our net recourse exposure $ 392,450 794,934 Reimbursement agreements from partners 127,428 238,692 Partner several recourse 285,519 465,641 Non recourse land seller debt or other debt 90,519 202,048 Non recourse debt with completion guarantees 820,435 1,432,880 Non recourse debt without completion guarantees 2,345,707 1,982,475 Total debt $ 4,062,058 5,116,670 Some of the unconsolidated entities debt arrangements contain financial covenants. As market conditions remained challenged during the year ended November 30, 2008, we continued to closely monitor these covenants and the unconsolidated entities abilities to comply with them. In these challenged market conditions, some of the unconsolidated entities may have to request of their lenders waivers or amendments to debt agreements so that the unconsolidated entities would remain in compliance with such covenants. Additionally, unconsolidated entities may have to extend or refinance the debt if their operations are not on track to meet their projected cash flows. In instances in which we have guaranteed obligations of unconsolidated entities, the entities inability to comply with loan covenants could result in calls on our guarantees. Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to unconsolidated entities in which we had investments that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows: Balance Sheets November 30, 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 135,081 301,468 Inventories 7,115,360 7,941,835 Other assets 541,984 827,208 $ 7,792,425 9,070,511 Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 1,042,002 1,214,374 Debt 4,062,058 5,116,670 Equity of: Lennar 766,752 934,271 Others 1,921,613 1,805,196 Total equity of unconsolidated entities 2,688,365 2,739,467 $ 7,792,425 9,070,511 Our equity in its unconsolidated entities 29 % 34 % 42 Table of Contents Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities is calculated as follows: November 30, 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Debt $ 4,062,058 5,116,670 Equity 2,688,365 2,739,467 Total capital $ 6,750,423 7,856,137 Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities 60.2 % 65.1 % Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities (excluding LandSource) 49.8 % 61.1 % In November 2007, we sold a portfolio of land to a strategic land investment venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., in which we have a 20% ownership interest and 50% voting rights. We also manage the land investment ventures operations and receive fees for our services. As part of the transaction, we entered into option agreements and obtained rights of first offer providing us the opportunity to purchase certain finished homesites. We have no obligation to exercise the options and cannot acquire a majority of the entitys assets. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory has remained on our consolidated balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned. As a result of the transaction, the land investment venture recorded the purchase of the portfolio of land as inventory. As of November 30, 2008, the portfolio of land (including land development costs) of $538.4 million is reflected as inventory in the summarized condensed financial information related to unconsolidated entities in which we have investments.

In June 2008, the LandSource Communities Development LLC (LandSource) unconsolidated joint venture and a number of its subsidiaries commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. We own 16% of LandSource, and until 2007, we had owned 50%. In November 2008, our land purchase options with LandSource were terminated, thus we recognized a deferred profit of $101.3 million (net of $31.8 million of write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs and other write offs) related to the 2007 recapitalization of LandSource. The bankruptcy filing could result in LandSource losing some or all of the properties it owns, termination of our management agreement with LandSource, claims against us and a substantial reduction (or total elimination) of our 16% ownership interest in LandSource, which had a carrying value of zero at November 30, 2008. In February 2007, the LandSource joint venture admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. As part of the transaction, the joint venture obtained $1.6 billion of non recourse financing, which consisted of a $200 million five year Revolving Credit Facility, a $1.1 billion six year Term Loan B Facility and a $244 million seven year Second Lien Term Facility. The transaction resulted in a cash distribution to us of $707.6 million. As a result, our ownership in LandSource was reduced to 16%. As a result of the recapitalization, we recognized a pretax financial statement gain of $175.9 million during the year ended November 30, 2007. During the year ended November 30, 2007, we also recognized $24.7 million of profit deferred at the time of the recapitalization of the LandSource joint venture in management fees and other income (expense), net. 43 Table of Contents Option Contracts In our homebuilding operations, we often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. These option deposits generally approximate 10% of the exercise price. Our option contracts sometimes include price adjustment provisions, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at the time of acquisition or are based on fair value at the time of takedown. The exercise periods of our option contracts generally range from one to ten years. Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with SFAS 144 and SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options. Some option contracts contain a predetermined take down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, we are not required to purchase land in accordance with those take down schedules. In substantially all instances, we have the right and ability to not exercise our option and forfeit our deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of our deposit and pre acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, we do not consider the take down price to be a firm contractual obligation. When we intend not to exercise an option, we write off any deposit and pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. For the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we wrote off $97.2 million, $530.0 million and $152.2 million, respectively, of option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to 8,200 homesites, 36,900 homesites and 24,200 homesites, respectively, under option that we do not intend to purchase. The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties (optioned) or unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have investments (JVs) (i.e., controlled homesites) for each of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other at November 30, 2008 and 2007: November 30, 2008 Controlled Homesites OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites Optioned JVs Total East 8,705 4,444 13,149 25,688 38,837 Central 1,820 5,991 7,811 14,501 22,312 West 203 12,078 12,281 18,776 31,057 Houston 1,461 2,654 4,115 7,389 11,504 Other 529 704 1,233 8,327 9,560 Total homesites 12,718 25,871 38,589 74,681 113,270 November 30, 2007 Controlled Homesites OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites Optioned JVs Total East 14,888 14,091 28,979 24,014 52,993 Central 3,470 12,679 16,149 7,848 23,997 West 1,243 30,800 32,043 15,300 47,343 Houston 2,313 3,694 6,007 7,071 13,078 Other 963 1,729 2,692 8,568 11,260 Total homesites 22,877 62,993 85,870 62,801 148,671 We evaluated all option contracts for land when entered into or upon a reconsideration event to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R), if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, we are required to consolidate the land under 44 Table of Contents option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During the year ended November 30, 2008, the effect of consolidation of these option contracts was an increase of $32.4 million to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in our consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2008. This increase was offset primarily by our exercise of options to acquire land under certain contracts previously consolidated, resulting in a net decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of $141.3 million. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46R, we reclassified $2.5 million of related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2008. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits. Our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $191.2 million and $317.1 million, respectively, at November 30, 2008 and 2007. Additionally, we had posted $89.5 million and $193.3 million, respectively, of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November 30, 2008 and 2007. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2008: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years (In thousands) Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 2,544,935 427,542 730,516 387,438 999,439 Financial services Notes and other debts payable 225,783 225,682 46 42 13 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt (1) 570,929 126,520 208,084 145,401 90,924 Operating leases 169,116 48,411 68,716 28,229 23,760 Total contractual obligations (2) $ 3,510,763 828,155 1,007,362 561,110 1,114,136 (1) Interest commitments on variable interest bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of November 30, 2008. (2) Total contractual obligations exclude our FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48) liability of $100.2 million as of November 30, 2008 because we were unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2008, we had access to 38,589 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2008, we had $191.2 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and $89.5 million of letters of credit posted in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts. At November 30, 2008, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $446.0 million (which included the $89.5 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Additionally, at November 30, 2008, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects in our joint ventures) of $1.1 billion. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2008, there were approximately $444.2 million, or 42%, of costs to complete related to these site improvements. We do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds, but if any such draws occur, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $710.8 million at November 30, 2008. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers and builder commitments for loan programs totaled $248.8 million as of November 30, 2008. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire 45 Table of Contents without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At November 30, 2008, we had open commitments amounting to $332.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2009. The following sections discuss economic conditions, market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business: Economic Conditions Throughout 2007 and 2008, market conditions in the homebuilding industry were negatively impacted by broad based pressures such as rising unemployment, falling home prices, increased foreclosures, tighter credit and volatile equity markets, which further eroded consumer confidence and depressed home sales. These market conditions resulted in high cancellation rates of 26% and 30%, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. Despite our continued use of sales incentives, our net new orders were down 48% and 39%, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. Our sales incentives were $48,700 per home delivered and $48,000 per home delivered, respectively in 2008 and 2007. A continued decline in the prices for new homes could adversely affect our revenues and margins, as well as the carrying amount of our inventory and other investments. Market and Financing Risk We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and borrowings under our warehouse lines of credit. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the option. We tried to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believed to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we viewed as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and, until 2007 and 2008, limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative, we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered throughout 2007 and 2008. Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. Due to challenged market conditions, we are currently focusing our efforts, in all quarters, on inventory management in order to deliver inventory and generate cash. Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. During 2008, increased costs of materials and labor along with a decrease in home sales prices contributed to lower gross margins and significant inventory valuation adjustments. Converserly, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. 46 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on December 1, 2007. The FASB deferred the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities; implementation by us is now required on December 1, 2008. SFAS 157 has not and is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value, but has resulted and will result in certain additional disclosures. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. It broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and interests transferred as a result of business combinations. SFAS 141R expands on required disclosures to improve the statement users abilities to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations that close on or after December 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the consolidated financial statements. It also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2009. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 expands the disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, regarding an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 161 is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosure by Public Entities (Enterprises) About Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities. The purpose of the FSP is to promptly improve disclosures by public companies until the pending amendments to FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, (SFAS 140), and FIN 46R are finalized and approved by the FASB. The FSP amends SFAS 140 to require public companies to provide additional disclosures about transferors continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46R by requiring public companies to provide additional disclosures regarding their involvement with variable interest entities. This FSP is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2008. The FSP will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. 47 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, (SFAS 66). Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review inventories for impairment during each reporting period on a community by community basis. SFAS 144 requires that if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value. In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the fair value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review we identify communities whose carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. These projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. We generally use a 20% discount rate, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. For example, construction in progress inventory which is closer to completion will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development. We estimate fair values of inventory evaluated for impairment under SFAS 144 based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. For example, further market deterioration or changes in our assumptions may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory, as well as on inventory not currently impaired, but for which indicators of impairment may arise if further market deterioration occurs. We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. Our option contracts are recorded at cost. In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property that is the subject of the option. If we intend to walk away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and related pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to 48 Table of Contents change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, managements projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded $340.5 million, $2,445.1 million and $501.8 million, respectively, of inventory adjustments, which included $195.5 million, $747.8 million and $280.5 million, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments to finished homes, construction in progress and land on which we intend to build homes, $47.8 million, $1,167.3 million and $69.1 million, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments to land we intend to sell or have sold to third parties and $97.2 million, $530.0 million and $152.2 million, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006 of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs. The $1,167.3 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments recorded in 2007 to land we intend to sell or have sold to third parties includes $740.4 million of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to the portfolio of land we sold to our strategic land investment venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., which was formed in November 2007. The SFAS 144 valuation adjustments were estimated based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the valuation adjustments were recorded, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and homebuilding other. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2008, the reserve for warranty costs was $129.4 million. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for construction of homes for sale third party homebuyers. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FIN 46R, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. 49 Table of Contents Management uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2008, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2008, the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $7.8 billion and total liabilities of $5.1 billion. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with APB 18. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Additionally, we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other than temporary. These factors include age of the venture, intent and ability for us to retain our investment in the entity, financial condition and long term prospects of the entity and relationships with the other partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded. The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes two critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities and (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the unconsolidated entities. Such inventory is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities in accordance with SFAS 144. The unconsolidated entities generally use a 20% discount rate in their SFAS 144 reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity in accordance with SFAS 144, our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities. In certain instances, we may be required to record additional losses relating to our investment in unconsolidated entities under APB 18; such losses are included in management fees and other income (expense), net. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived. We believe our assumptions on discount rates are also critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates also affects the estimated fair value of our investment in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investment in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investment in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded $205.0 million, $496.4 million and $140.9 million, respectively, of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities, which included $32.2 million, $364.2 million and $126.4 million, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, of our share of SFAS 144 valuation adjustments related to assets of our unconsolidated entities and $172.8 million, $132.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities in accordance with APB 18. These valuation adjustments were calculated based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the valuation adjustments were recorded, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and homebuilding other. 50 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policies. Escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held for sale and loans held for investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Allowance for Loan and Other Losses We provide an allowance for loan losses by taking into consideration various factors such as past loan loss experience, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2008, the allowance for loan losses was $20.4 million, compared to $11.1 million at November 30, 2007. We believe that the 2008 year end allowance is adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market on a non recourse basis within 30 days after we originate them. Since we remain liable for certain representations and warranties, there can be no assurances that further deterioration in the housing market and future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher occurrence of loan write offs. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate. We provide a reserve for estimated title and escrow losses based upon managements evaluation of claims presented and estimates for any incurred but not reported claims. The reserve is established at a level that management estimates to be sufficient to satisfy those claims where a loss is determined to be probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The reserve for title and escrow losses for both known and incurred but not reported claims is considered by management to be adequate for such purposes. Homebuilding and Financial Services Operations Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis. Inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or whenever indicators of impairment exist) for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142). Due to the continued deterioration in market conditions as a result of tightening mortgage credit standards and other factors, we evaluated the carrying value of our Financial Services segments goodwill for impairment in both our third and fourth quarters of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, we impaired $27.2 million of our Financial Services segments goodwill. We also performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2008 and no additional impairments were recorded. During the year ended November 30, 2007, we impaired $190.2 million of goodwill related to our homebuilding operations. We did not record impairment charges during the year ended November 30, 2006. As of November 30, 2008 and 2007, there were no material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill. 51 Table of Contents During the year ended November 30, 2007, we used an equally weighted combination of the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting units when performing our impairment test of goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142. The market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold. We wrote off all of our homebuilding operations goodwill during the year ended November 30, 2007. As a result, our recorded goodwill of $61.2 million as of November 30, 2007 was attributed entirely to our Financial Services segment. For our review of the Financial Services segments goodwill during the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we determined the fair value of our Financial Services segment based entirely on the income approach due to a lack of guideline companies with adequate comparisons to our Financial Services segment on a stand alone basis. The income approach establishes fair value by methods which discount or capitalize earnings and or cash flow by a discount or capitalization rate that reflects market rate of return expectations, market conditions and the risk of the relative investment. We used a discounted cash flow method when applying the income approach. This analysis includes operating income, interest expense, taxes, incremental working capital and long term debt, as well as other factors. The projections used in the analysis are for a five year period and represent what we consider to be normalized earnings. In determining the fair value of our Financial Services segment under the income approach, our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions. The most significant assumptions affecting our expected cash flows are the discount rate, projected revenue growth rate and operating profit margin. The impact of a change in any of our significant underlying assumptions +/ 1% would not result in a materially different fair value. At November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007, goodwill was $34.0 million and $61.2 million, respectively. Our goodwill of $34.0 million at November 30, 2008 is recorded in our Financial Services segment. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. SFAS 109 requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by us based on the SFAS 109 more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. Based on our assessment, the uncertain and volatile market conditions and the fact that we are now in a cumulative loss position over the evaluation period, we recorded a non cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $730.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2008. In future periods, the allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized. At November 30, 2008, we had no net deferred tax assets, compared to net deferred tax assets of $746.9 million at November 30, 2007. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results, which may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. 52 Table of Contents Share Based Payments We have share based awards outstanding under four different plans which provide for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock (nonvested shares) to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the plans may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant. We account for stock option awards granted under the plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R). Effective December 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized during the year ended November 30, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to December 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. We believe that the accounting estimate for share based payments is a critical accounting estimate because the calculation of share based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require managements judgments. These estimates include the fair value of each of our stock option awards, which are estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model as discussed in Note 13 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this document. The fair value of our stock option awards, which are subject to graded vesting, is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options. Expected volatility is based on an average of (1) historical volatility of our stock and (2) implied volatility from traded options on our stock. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award granted. We use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model. The expected life of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding. SFAS 123R requires that cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) be classified as financing cash flows. 53 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The table below provides information at November 30, 2008 about our significant financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For loans held for sale, loans held for investment and investments held to maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values at November 30, 2008. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2008. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2008 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein. 55 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of November 30, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2008 of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Certified Public Accountants Miami, Florida January 26, 2009 56 Table of Contents
