Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements, except as required by Federal securities laws. Outlook During our 2010 fiscal year, we continued to see a housing market that was trying to stabilize. This stabilization process was impacted by the expiration of the Federal homebuyer tax credit at the end of April 2010, which contributed to a reduction in the pace of home sales. The rate at which homes sold nationally was also adversely affected by high unemployment, lenders effort to sell foreclosed homes, tight lending standards and low consumer confidence. All these factors contributed to a 5% decline in our new orders during our 2010 fiscal year compared with prior year. Overall, recovery of the housing market is still sporadic, and how long it will take for the housing market to return to historical conditions is uncertain. We have remained focused on improving our core business and we returned to profitability in 2010. Our principal focus in our homebuilding operations is on maintaining and improving our gross profit margin on the homes we sell. We have taken steps over the past several years to reduce costs and right size our overhead structure. We have also repositioned our product offering to target first time and value focused homebuyers, the result of which has only recently begun to be reflected in our operating results. We continue to make carefully underwritten strategic land acquisitions in well positioned markets that will support our homebuilding operations going forward. As a result, we are beginning to open communities with land that we purchased relatively recently at prices that reflect the recent depressed state of the market with respect to land that is suitable for residential homebuilding. Our Rialto Investments (Rialto) segment added significant profits to our bottom line, generating operating earnings of $24.2 million (net of $33.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests) in year ended November 30, 2010. During our 2010 fiscal year, we acquired for $243 million, a 40% interest (with the FDIC holding the other 60%) in a pool of real estate loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $3 billion acquired by the FDIC from 22 failed banks, and acquired for approximately $310 million, portfolios of mortgage loans and REO from three financial institutions. In the fourth quarter, we also completed the first closing of our Rialto real estate investment fund (the Fund) with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by us). Through the Fund, we will continue to invest in distressed opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future earnings. Although high unemployment, tight lending standards and low consumer confidence continue to present challenges for the housing market, we believe that 2011 will be another profitable year. We believe that our homebuilding operations are on track to achieving sustainable profitability as the housing market stabilizes and ultimately recovers and our financial services and Rialto Investments segments will continue to enhance our earnings. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview Our net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2010 were $95.3 million, or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to Lennar of $417.1 million, or $2.45 per basic and diluted share, in 2009. Our gross margin percentage improved in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to a reduction in valuation adjustments and reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales. The following table sets forth financial and operational information for the years indicated related to our operations. Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands, except average sales price) Lennar Homebuilding revenues: Sales of homes $ 2,631,314 2,776,850 4,150,717 Sales of land 74,325 57,435 112,321 Total Lennar Homebuilding revenues 2,705,639 2,834,285 4,263,038 Lennar Homebuilding costs and expenses: Cost of homes sold 2,113,393 2,524,850 3,641,090 Cost of land sold 52,968 236,277 245,536 Selling, general and administrative 376,962 449,259 655,255 Total Lennar Homebuilding costs and expenses 2,543,323 3,210,386 4,541,881 Lennar Homebuilding operating margins 162,316 (376,101 ) (278,843 ) Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (10,966 ) (130,917 ) (59,156 ) Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net 19,135 (98,425 ) (172,387 ) Other interest expense (70,425 ) (70,850 ) (27,594 ) Gain on recapitalization of unconsolidated entity 133,097 Lennar Homebuilding operating earnings (loss) 100,060 (676,293 ) (404,883 ) Lennar Financial Services revenues 275,786 285,102 312,379 Lennar Financial Services costs and expenses (1) 244,502 249,120 343,369 Lennar Financial Services operating earnings (loss) 31,284 35,982 (30,990 ) Rialto Investments revenues 92,597 Rialto Investments costs and expenses 67,904 2,528 Rialto Investments equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 15,363 Rialto Investments other income, net 17,251 Rialto Investments operating earnings (loss) 57,307 (2,528 ) Total operating earnings (loss) 188,651 (642,839 ) (435,873 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (93,926 ) (117,565 ) (129,752 ) Earnings (loss) before income taxes $ 94,725 (760,404 ) (565,625 ) Gross margin on home sales 19.7 % 9.1 % 12.3 % SG&A expenses as a % of revenues from home sales 14.3 % 16.2 % 15.8 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales 5.4 % (7.1 )% (3.5 )% Gross margin on home sales excluding valuation adjustments (2) 21.4 % 15.6 % 17.0 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments (2) 7.1 % (0.6 )% 1.2 % Average sales price $ 243,000 243,000 270,000 (1) Lennar Financial Services costs and expenses for the year ended November 30, 2008 include a $27.2 million impairment of goodwill. (2) Gross margin on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and operating margin as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments are non GAAP financial measures disclosed by certain of our competitors and have been presented because we find it useful in evaluating our performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors. See the Non GAAP Financial Measure section. 25 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 Revenues from home sales decreased 5% in the year ended November 30, 2010 to $2.6 billion from $2.8 billion in 2009. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 5% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 10,859 homes in the year ended November 30, 2010 from 11,422 homes last year. The average sales price of homes delivered for both the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009 was $243,000. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $32,800 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2010, or 11.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $44,800 per home delivered in the prior year, or 15.6% as a percentage of home sales revenue. Gross margins on home sales were $517.9 million, or 19.7%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included $44.7 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $252.0 million, or 9.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $180.2 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments were $562.6 million, or 21.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to $432.2 million, or 15.6%, in 2009. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding valuation adjustments, improved compared to last year, due primarily to reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales, reduced construction costs and product re engineering, as well as third party recoveries related to Chinese drywall. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure, which is discussed in the Non GAAP Financial Measure section. Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $72.3 million, or 16%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to reductions in legal, personnel and occupancy expenses. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 14.3% in the year ended November 30, 2010, from 16.2% in 2009. Gross profits on land sales totaled $21.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, primarily due to the reduction of an obligation related to a profit participation agreement. Gross profits on land sales were net of $3.4 million of valuation adjustments and $3.1 million in write offs of deposits and pre acquisitions costs. Losses on land sales totaled $178.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $108.9 million of valuation adjustments and $84.4 million in write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs. Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included $10.5 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. In the year ended November 30, 2009, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $130.9 million, which included $101.9 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, totaled $19.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included a $19.4 million pre tax gain on the extinguishment of other debt and other income, partially offset by a $10.8 million pre tax loss related to the repurchase of senior notes through a tender offer and $1.7 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, totaled ($98.4) million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $89.0 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities and $9.7 million of write offs of notes and other receivables. Homebuilding interest expense was $143.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2010 ($71.5 million was included in cost of homes sold, $2.0 million in cost of land sold and $70.4 million in other interest expense), compared to $147.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2009 ($67.4 million was included in cost of homes sold, $9.2 million in cost of land sold and $70.9 million in other interest expense). Despite an increase in debt, interest expense decreased primarily due to an increase in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization and savings resulting from the termination of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2010. Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were $25.2 million and ($28.9) million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2010 were primarily related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC. 26 Table of Contents Sales of land, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, other income (expense), net and net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by the Company and unconsolidated entities in which it has investments. Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were $31.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to $36.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to decreased volume in the segments mortgage and title operations. In the year ended November 30, 2010, operating earnings for the Rialto Investments segment were $57.3 million (which included $33.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to an operating loss of $2.5 million in the prior year. In the year ended November 30, 2010, revenues in this segment were $92.6 million, which consisted primarily of accretable interest income associated with the portfolios of real estate loans acquired in partnership with the FDIC. In the year ended November 30, 2010, other income, net was $17.3 million, which consisted primarily of gains on the sale of real estate owned (REO) and gains from acquisition of REO through foreclosure. The segment also had equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $15.4 million during the year ended November 30, 2010, consisting primarily of interest income and unrealized gains related to our investment in the AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB) fund formed under the Federal governments Public Private Investment Program (PPIP). In the year ended November 30, 2010, expenses in this segment were $67.9 million, which consisted primarily of the carrying costs related to its portfolio operations, underwriting expenses related to both completed and abandoned transactions, and other general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $23.6 million, or 20%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to the same period last year primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives implemented during the downturn. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses decreased to 3.1% in the year ended November 30, 2010, from 3.8% in the prior year. A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Based upon an evaluation of all available evidence, during the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $37.9 million, primarily due to the recording of a deferred tax liability from the issuance of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 and the net earnings generated during the year. The reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the issuance of the 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. At November 30, 2010, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $609.5 million. At November 30, 2010, we owned 84,482 homesites and had access to an additional 19,974 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2010, 2% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 1,604 homes ($407.3 million) at November 30, 2010, compared to 1,631 homes ($479.6 million) at November 30, 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Revenues from home sales decreased 33% in the year ended November 30, 2009 to $2.8 billion from $4.2 billion in 2008. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 26% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 10% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in 2009. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 11,422 homes in the year ended November 30, 2009 from 15,344 homes in 2008. In the year ended November 30, 2009, new home deliveries were lower in each of our Lennar Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to 2008. The average sales price of homes delivered decreased to $243,000 in the year ended November 30, 2009 from $270,000 in 2008. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $44,800 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to $48,700 per home delivered in 2008. Gross margins on home sales were $252.0 million, or 9.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $180.2 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $509.6 million, or 12.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $195.5 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments were $432.2 million, or 15.6%, in the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to $705.1 million, or 17.0%, in 2008. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding valuation adjustments, decreased compared to 2008, due primarily to reduced sales prices. 27 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $206.0 million, or 31%, in the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to reductions in associate headcount, variable selling expenses and fixed costs. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 16.2% in the year ended November 30, 2009, from 15.8% in 2008, due to lower revenues. Losses on land sales totaled $178.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $108.9 million of valuation adjustments and $84.4 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to homesites under option that we did not intend to purchase. In the year ended November 30, 2008, losses on land sales totaled $133.2 million, which included $47.8 million of valuation adjustments and $97.2 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to homesites that were under option. Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $130.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $101.9 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, compared to Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $59.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $32.2 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Lennar Homebuilding other expense, net totaled $98.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $89.0 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities and $9.7 million of write offs of notes and other receivables, compared to Lennar Homebuilding other expense, net of $172.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2008, which included $172.8 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities and $25.0 million of write offs of notes and other receivables. Homebuilding interest expense was $147.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2009 ($67.4 million was included in cost of homes sold, $9.2 million in cost of land sold and $70.9 million in other interest expense), compared to $130.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2008 ($99.3 million was included in cost of homes sold, $3.4 million in cost of land sold and $27.6 million in other interest expense). Despite a decrease in deliveries during the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to 2008, interest expense increased primarily due to the interest related to the $400 million 12.25% senior notes due 2017 issued during the second quarter of 2009, as well as a reduction in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization as a result of a decrease in inventories from prior year. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $28.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $13.6 million of noncontrolling interest income as a result of $27.2 million of valuation adjustments to inventories of 50% owned consolidated joint ventures, compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $4.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2008. Sales of land, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities, other income (expense), net and net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions entered into by us and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment was $36.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to an operating loss of $31.0 million in 2008. The increase in profitability in the Lennar Financial Services segment was primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of successful cost reduction initiatives implemented throughout the downturn. In addition, in the year ended November 30, 2008, there was a $27.2 million write off of goodwill related to the segments mortgage operations, compared to no write off in the year ended November 30, 2009. Operating loss for the Rialto Investments segment was $2.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which related primarily to general and administrative expenses incurred to start up the Rialto Investments segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $12.2 million, or 9%, for the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to 2008. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 3.8% in the year ended November 30, 2009, from 2.8% in 2008, due to lower revenues. As a result of our net operating loss during the year ended November 30, 2009, we generated deferred tax assets of $269.6 million and recorded a non cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax assets. In addition, we recorded a reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $351.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to a change in tax legislation, which allowed us to carry back our fiscal year 2009 tax loss to recover previously paid income taxes. 28 Table of Contents At November 30, 2009, we owned 82,703 homesites and had access to an additional 21,173 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2009, 2% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 1,631 homes ($479.6 million) at November 30, 2009, compared to 1,599 homes ($456.3 million) at November 30, 2008. Non GAAP Financial Measure Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure, and is defined by us as sales of homes revenue less cost of homes sold excluding valuation adjustments recorded during the period. Management finds this to be an important and useful measure in evaluating our performance because it discloses the profit we generate on homes we actually delivered during the period, as our valuation adjustments generally relate to inventory that we did not deliver during the period. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments also is important to our management, because it assists our management in making strategic decisions regarding our construction pace, product mix and product pricing based upon the profitability we generated on homes we actually delivered during previous periods. We believe investors also find gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments to be important and useful because it discloses a profitability measure on homes we actually delivered in a period that can be compared to the profitability on homes we delivered in a prior period without regard to the variability of valuation adjustments recorded from period to period. In addition, to the extent that our competitors provide similar information, disclosure of our gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments helps readers of our financial statements compare our ability to generate profits with regard to the homes we deliver in a period to our competitors ability to generate profits with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period. Although management finds gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating our operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by our company during the period. This is because it excludes charges we recorded relating to inventory that was impaired during the period. In addition, because gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), it may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded. Our management compensates for the limitations of using gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments by using this non GAAP measure only to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. In order to analyze our overall performance and actual profitability relative to our homebuilding operations, we also compare our gross margins on home sales during the period, inclusive of valuation adjustments, with the same measure during prior comparable periods. Due to the limitations discussed above, gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments should not be viewed in isolation as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures of gross margins. The table set forth below reconciles our gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 to our gross margins on home sales for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Sales of homes $ 2,631,314 2,776,850 4,150,717 Cost of homes sold 2,113,393 2,524,850 3,641,090 Gross margins on home sales 517,921 252,000 509,627 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 44,717 180,239 195,518 Gross margins on homes sales excluding valuation adjustments $ 562,638 432,239 705,145 Homebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations also purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and attempt to minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures. 29 Table of Contents We have grouped our homebuilding activities into four reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, Homebuilding West and Homebuilding Houston. Information about homebuilding activities in states that do not have economic characteristics that are similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other. Reference in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those reportable segments. At November 30, 2010, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in: East: Florida, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia.

The table set forth below reconciles our gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 for each of our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other to our gross margins on home sales for the three respective years: Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) East: Sales of homes $ 922,947 844,689 1,252,725 Cost of homes sold 690,584 808,528 1,088,229 Gross margins on home sales 232,363 36,161 164,496 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 10,410 73,670 76,791 Gross margins on homes sales excluding valuation adjustments 242,773 109,831 241,287 Central: Sales of homes 348,486 361,273 512,957 Cost of homes sold 304,329 332,040 481,176 Gross margins on home sales 44,157 29,233 31,781 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 9,205 13,603 28,142 Gross margins on homes sales excluding valuation adjustments 53,362 42,836 59,923 West: Sales of homes 650,844 810,459 1,408,051 Cost of homes sold 525,310 717,631 1,253,952 Gross margins on home sales 125,534 92,828 154,099 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 7,139 64,095 75,614 Gross margins on homes sales excluding valuation adjustments 132,673 156,923 229,713 Houston: Sales of homes 357,590 429,127 542,288 Cost of homes sold 289,474 353,838 438,368 Gross margins on home sales 68,116 75,289 103,920 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 219 1,116 2,262 Gross margins on homes sales excluding valuation adjustments 68,335 76,405 106,182 Other: Sales of homes 351,447 331,302 434,696 Cost of homes sold 303,696 312,813 379,365 Gross margins on home sales 47,751 18,489 55,331 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 17,744 27,755 12,709 Gross margins on homes sales excluding valuation adjustments 65,495 46,244 68,040 Total gross margins on home sales $ 517,921 252,000 509,627 Total valuation adjustments $ 44,717 180,239 195,518 Total gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments $ 562,638 432,239 705,145 37 Table of Contents Lennar Financial Services Segment We have one Lennar Financial Services reportable segment that provides primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of our homes and others. Substantially all of the loans the Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to the Lennar Financial Services segment: Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 275,786 285,102 312,379 Costs and expenses (1) 244,502 249,120 343,369 Operating earnings (loss) (1) $ 31,284 35,982 (30,990 ) Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 3,272,000 4,020,000 4,290,000 Number of mortgages originated 15,200 17,900 18,300 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 85 % 87 % 85 % Number of title and closing service transactions 102,500 120,500 105,900 Number of title policies issued 107,600 92,500 96,700 (1) Financial Services costs and expenses and operating loss for the year ended November 30, 2008 include a $27.2 million impairment of goodwill. Rialto Investments Segment Our Rialto segment is a new reportable segment that met the reportable segment criteria set forth in GAAP beginning in fiscal 2010. All prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the 2010 presentation. The change had no effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, except for certain reclassifications. Rialtos objective is to generate superior, risk adjusted returns by focusing on commercial and residential real estate opportunities arising from dislocations in the United States real estate markets and the eventual restructure and recapitalization of those markets. Rialto believes it will be able to deliver these returns through its abilities to source, underwrite, price, manage and ultimately monetize real estate assets, as well as providing similar services to others in markets across the country. The following table presents the results of operations of our Rialto segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenues $ 92,597 Costs and expenses 67,904 2,528 Rialto Investments equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 15,363 Rialto Investments other income, net 17,251 Operating earnings (loss) (1) $ 57,307 (2,528 ) (1) Operating earnings for the year ended November 30, 2010 include $33.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Distressed Asset Portfolios In February 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies (LLCs), in partnership with the FDIC, for approximately $243 million (net of transactions costs and a $22 million working capital reserve). The LLCs hold performing and non performing loans formerly owned by 22 failed financial institutions. The two portfolios originally consisted of more than 5,500 distressed residential and commercial real estate loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $3 billion and an initial fair value of approximately $1.2 billion. The FDIC retained a 60% equity 38 Table of Contents interest in the LLCs and provided $626.9 million of notes with 0% interest, which are non recourse to us. In accordance with GAAP, interest has not been imputed because the notes are with, and guaranteed by, a governmental agency. The notes are secured by the loans held by the LLCs. Additionally, if the LLCs exceed expectations and meet certain internal rate of return and distribution thresholds, our equity interest in the LLCs could be reduced from 40% down to 30%, with a corresponding increase to the FDICs equity interest from 60% up to 70%. Although our equity interest could decrease, we believe we would most likely yield a higher return on our investment if the thresholds are met. As of November 30, 2010, the notes payable balance was $626.9 million; however, during the year ended November 30, 2010, $101.3 million of cash collections on loans in excess of expenses were deposited in a defeasance account, established for the repayment of the notes payable, under the agreement with the FDIC. The funds in the defeasance account will be used to retire the notes payable upon their maturity. The LLCs met the accounting definition of variable interest entities (VIEs) and since we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, we consolidated the LLCs. We determined that we were the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance through our management and servicer contracts. At November 30, 2010, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of $1.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. In September 2010, the Rialto segment completed the acquisitions of over $700 million of distressed real estate assets, in separate transactions, from three financial institutions. The combined portfolio includes approximately 400 loans with a total aggregate unpaid principal balance of over $500 million and over 300 real estate owned (REO) properties with an original appraised value of approximately $200 million. We paid $310 million for the distressed real estate assets of which $125 million was financed through a 5 year senior unsecured note provided by one of the selling institutions. The loans consist primarily of non performing residential and commercial acquisition development and construction loans. The largest concentration of collateral for these loans is finished/partially finished homesites, undeveloped land and completed/partially completed homes. The real estate properties primarily consist of land, homesites, and single family and multi family residential communities at varying stages of completion. In the combined portfolio, 65% of the assets are residential and 35% are commercial. The acquired assets are located in 17 states, primarily in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast regions of the United States with the largest concentration of assets in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Investments An affiliate in the Rialto segment is a sub advisor to the AB PPIP fund and receives management fees for sub advisory services. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we invested $63.8 million, in the AB PPIP fund. As of November 30, 2010, the carrying value of our investment in the AB PPIP fund was $77.3 million. In November 2010, the Rialto segment completed the closing of its Fund with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by us). The Funds objective during its three year investment period is to invest in distressed real estate assets and other related investments that fit within the Funds investment parameters. In addition, the Rialto segment also invested in approximately $43 million of non investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) for $19.4 million, representing a 55% discount to par value. We have grouped these investments in the Rialto segment, along with our $7.3 million, or approximately 5%, investment in a service and infrastructure provider to the residential home loan market (the Service Provider), which provides services to the LLCs. Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents related to our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto operations of $1.4 billion, compared to $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, at November 30, 2009 and 2008. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Rialto activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and equity offerings, as well as cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit. 39 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2010 and 2009, cash provided by operating activities totaled $274.2 million and $420.8 million, respectively. During 2010, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by the receipt of tax refunds of $343.0 million generated primarily from losses incurred prior to fiscal 2010 and our net earnings. This was partially offset by a net increase in inventories of $115.2 million, primarily due to a higher level of land purchases in strategic markets during the year ended November 30, 2010 and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities. During 2009, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by a decrease in inventories as a result of reducing completed, unsold inventory, a reduction in construction in progress resulting from lower new home starts in early 2009 and write offs and valuation adjustments pertaining to the respective inventory, which was partially offset by land acquisitions. Cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by our net loss, a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities and an increase in our receivables as a result of an increase in our income tax receivables primarily due to a change in tax legislation, which allowed us to carryback our fiscal year 2009 tax loss to recover previously paid income taxes. Investing Cash Flow Activities During 2010 and 2009, cash used in investing activities totaled $673.4 million and $275.1 million, respectively. During the year ended November 30, 2010, our Rialto segment contributed $243 million of cash (net of $22 million working capital reserve) to acquire indirectly 40% managing member interests in two LLCs in partnership with the FDIC. Upon consolidation of the LLCs that hold the two portfolios of real estate loans acquired in the FDIC transaction, the Company consolidated $93.7 million of cash, resulting in net contributions to consolidated entities by the Rialto segment of $171.4 million during the year ended November 30, 2010. In addition, during 2010 cash collections of $101.3 million on loans in excess of expenses were deposited in a defeasance account established for the repayment of the notes payable under the agreement with the FDIC. In September 2010, our Rialto segment used $183.4 million of cash to acquire portfolios of distressed loans and real estate assets, in separate transactions, from three financial institutions. The Rialto segment also contributed $64.3 million of cash to unconsolidated entities related primarily to the AB PPIP fund. Additionally, during 2010 we contributed $209.3 million of cash to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities of which $113.5 million was to retire and extend debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities thereby decreasing leverage at the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities and $95.8 million was for working capital. Specifically, we contributed $69.6 million to one Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity of which $50.3 million was a loan paydown, representing both our and our partners share, in return for a 4 year loan extension and the rights to obtain preferred returns and priority distributions at that unconsolidated entity. We also made a $19.3 million payment to extinguish debt at a discount and buy out the partner of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity resulting in a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million. During the year ended November 30, 2009, we contributed $316.1 million of cash to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities of which $94.5 million related to our investment in the reorganized Newhall, as well as the purchase of equity interests in other joint ventures previously owned by LandSource. We are always evaluating the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. However, at November 30, 2010, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions. Financing Cash Flow Activities During 2010 and 2009, our cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the issuance of new debt, partially offset by the redemption of senior notes and principal payments on other borrowings. During 2010 and 2009, we exercised certain land option contracts from a land investment venture that we sold land to in 2007, reducing the liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet related to consolidated inventory not owned by $39.3 million and $33.7 million, respectively. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory remained on our balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned. 40 Table of Contents Debt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our Lennar Homebuilding operations. Management believes providing a measure of leverage of our Lennar Homebuilding operations enables management and readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance. Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital are calculated as follows: November 30, 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Lennar Homebuilding debt $ 3,128,154 2,761,352 Total stockholders equity 2,608,949 2,443,479 Total capital $ 5,737,103 5,204,831 Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital 54.5 % 53.1 % Lennar Homebuilding debt $ 3,128,154 2,761,352 Less: Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents 1,207,247 1,330,603 Net Lennar Homebuilding debt $ 1,920,907 1,430,749 Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital (1) 42.4 % 36.9 % (1) Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus total stockholders equity). At November 30, 2010, net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital was higher compared to prior year primarily due to the increase in Lennar Homebuilding debt as a result of an increase in senior notes and other debts payable and a decrease in Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in stockholders equity. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our warehouse lines of credit, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance into capital markets of debt, common stock or preferred stock. The following table summarizes our Lennar Homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) 5.95% senior notes due 2011 113,189 244,727 5.95% senior notes due 2013 266,319 347,471 5.50% senior notes due 2014 248,657 248,365 5.60% senior notes due 2015 501,216 501,424 6.50% senior notes due 2016 249,788 249,760 12.25% senior notes due 2017 393,031 392,392 6.95% senior notes due 2018 247,323 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 276,500 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 375,875 5.125% senior notes due 2010 249,955 Mortgage notes on land and other debt 456,256 527,258 $ 3,128,154 2,761,352 Our Lennar Homebuilding average debt outstanding was $2.8 billion in 2010, compared to $2.6 billion in 2009. The average rate for interest incurred was 6.1% and 6.0%, respectively in 2010 and 2009. Interest incurred related to Lennar Homebuilding debt for the year ended November 30, 2010 was $181.5 million, compared to $172.1 million in 2009. The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations and proceeds of debt issuances. 41 Table of Contents In November 2010, we issued $446.0 million of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes) at a price of 100% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of expenses, were $436.4 million. The net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including repayments or repurchases of existing senior notes or other indebtedness. The 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of both, at our election. However, it is our intent to settle the face value of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes in cash. Holders may convert the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes at the initial conversion rate of 45.1794 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount or 20,150,012 Class A common shares if all the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes are converted, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.13 per share of Class A common stock, subject to anti dilution adjustments. The shares are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share primarily because it is our intent to settle the face value of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes in cash and our stock price does not exceed the conversion price. Holders of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to convert them, if during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on November 30, 2010 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day. Holders of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase them for cash equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, on December 15, 2015. We will have the right to redeem the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes at any time on or after December 20, 2015 for 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Interest on the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes is due semi annually beginning June 15, 2011. Beginning with the period commencing December 20, 2015, under certain circumstances based on the average trading price of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes, we may be required to pay contingent interest. The 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, and currently are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain provisions under ASC Topic 470, Debt, require the issuer of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non convertible debt borrowing rate. We have applied these provisions related to our 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes. We estimated the fair value of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes using similar debt instruments at issuance that did not have a conversion feature and allocated the residual fair value to an equity component that represents the estimated fair value of the conversion feature at issuance. The debt discount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes is being amortized over five years and the annual effective interest is 7.1% after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs. At November 30, 2010, the principal amount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes was $446.0 million, the unamortized discount included in stockholders equity was $70.1 million and the net carrying amount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes was $375.9 million. The carrying amount of the equity component of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes was $71.2 million at November 30, 2010. During the year ended November 30, 2010, the amount of interest recognized relating to both the contractual interest and amortization of the discount was $1.7 million. In May 2010, we issued $250 million of 6.95% senior notes due 2018 (the 6.95% Senior Notes) at a price of 98.929% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $243.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the sale of the 6.95% Senior Notes to fund purchases pursuant to our tender offer for our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010, our 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and our 5.95% senior notes due 2013. Interest on the 6.95% Senior Notes is due semi annually beginning December 1, 2010. The 6.95% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, and currently are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Subsequently, most of the privately placed 6.95% Senior Notes were exchanged for substantially identical 6.95% senior notes that had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. At November 30, 2010, the carrying amount of the 6.95% Senior Notes was $247.3 million. In May 2010, we also issued $276.5 million of 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes) at a price of 100% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of expenses, were $271.2 million. The net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including repayments or repurchases of existing senior notes or other indebtedness. The 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at the initial conversion rate of 36.1827 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes or 10,004,517 Class A common shares if all the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes are converted, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $27.64 per share of Class A common stock, subject to anti dilution adjustments. The shares are 42 Table of Contents included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Holders of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase them for cash equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, on each of December 1, 2013 and December 1, 2015. We will have the right to redeem the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes at any time on or after December 1, 2013 for 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Interest on the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes is due semi annually beginning December 1, 2010. Beginning with the six month interest period commencing December 1, 2013, under certain circumstances based on the average trading price of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes, we may be required to pay contingent interest. The 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, and are currently guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries. At November 30, 2010, the carrying amount of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes was $276.5 million. In May 2010, we repurchased $289.4 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due 2010, 2011 and 2013 through a tender offer, resulting in a pre tax loss of $10.8 million. Through the tender offer, we repurchased $76.4 million principal amount of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010, $130.8 million principal amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and $82.3 million principal amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2013. During the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, we redeemed $150.8 million (including the amount redeemed through the tender offer) and $50.0 million, respectively, of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010. In October 2010, we retired the remaining $99.2 million of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010 for 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the maturity date. During the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, we redeemed $131.8 million (including the amount redeemed through the tender offer) and $5.0 million, respectively, of our 5.95% senior notes due 2011. At November 30, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2011 was $113.2 million and $244.7 million, respectively. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we redeemed $82.3 million (including the amount redeemed through the tender offer) of our 5.95% senior notes due 2013. At November 30, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2013 was $266.3 million and $347.5 million, respectively. Currently, substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries are guaranteeing all our Senior Notes (the Guaranteed Notes). The guarantees are full and unconditional. The principal reason our wholly owned subsidiaries guaranteed the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect only while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time, when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Therefore, if, the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under its letter of credit facility and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes. If our guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing a revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million. In February 2010, we terminated our $1.1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) and entered into cash collateralized letter of credit agreements with two banks with a capacity totaling $225 million. At that time, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as it was only being used to issue letters of credit. In November 2010, we terminated our cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and simultaneously entered into a $150 million Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (LC Agreement) with certain financial institutions. The LC Agreement may be increased to $200 million, although there are currently no commitments for the additional $50 million. At November 30, 2010, we believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Our performance letters of credit outstanding were $78.9 million and $97.7 million, respectively, at November 30, 2010 and 2009. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were $195.0 million and $205.4 million, respectively, at November 30, 2010 and 2009. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory 43 Table of Contents bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, and financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. At November 30, 2010, our Lennar Financial Services segment had a warehouse repurchase facility with a maximum aggregate commitment of $150 million and an additional uncommitted amount of $50 million that matures in April 2011, and another warehouse repurchase facility with a maximum aggregate commitment of $175 million that matures in July 2011. The maximum aggregate commitment under these facilities totaled $325 million. Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and expects the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. Borrowings under the facilities were $271.6 million and $217.5 million, respectively, at November 30, 2010 and 2009, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold to investors but not yet paid for with outstanding principal balances of $286.0 million and $266.9 million, respectively, at November 30, 2010 and 2009. These facilities have several interest rate pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The combined effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2010 was 3.9%. Since our Lennar Financial Services segments borrowings under the warehouse repurchase facilities are generally repaid with the proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and receivables on loans that secure those borrowings, the facilities are not likely to be a call on our current cash or future cash resources. If the facilities are not renewed, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be paid off by selling the mortgage loans held for sale and by collecting on receivables on loans sold but not yet paid. Without the facilities, our Lennar Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities. Our Lennar Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Our Lennar Financial Services segment enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. Changes in Capital Structure We have a stock repurchase program which permits the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no share repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. As of November 30, 2010, 6.2 million shares of common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program. Treasury stock increased by 0.1 million Class A common shares and 0.3 million Class A common shares, respectively, during the years ended November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009, due to activity related to our equity compensation plan and forfeitures of restricted stock. In April 2009, we entered into distribution agreements with J.P Morgan Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merril Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., relating to an offering of our Class A common stock into the market from time to time for an aggregate of up to $275 million. As of November 30, 2009, we had sold a total of 21.0 million shares of our Class A common stock under the equity offering for gross proceeds of $225.5 million, or an average of $10.76 per share. After compensation to the distributors of $4.5 million, we received net proceeds of $221.0 million. We used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. There was no activity related to these distribution agreements during 2010. During 2010 and 2009, Class A and Class B common stock holders received a per share annual dividend of $0.16. In October 2008, the Companys Board of Directors voted to decrease the annual dividend rate with regard to the Companys Class A and Class B common stock to $0.16 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.64 per share per year (payable quarterly). During 2008, Class A and Class B common stockholders received per share annual dividends of $0.52. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity. 44 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities At November 30, 2010, we had equity investments in 42 unconsolidated entities (of which 14 had recourse debt, 11 had non recourse debt and 17 had no debt), compared to 61 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2009. Historically, we invested in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Through these entities, we primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners. Although the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures partners vary, the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire, develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time. The joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. Additionally, most joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment or maintenance guarantees generally is required. Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of joint ventures earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyer. In some instances, we are designated as the manager under the direction of a management committee that has shared power amongst the partners of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts generally require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits are generally negotiated by management on a case by case basis. We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. Joint ventures in which we have investments are subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business. As discussed above, the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities. In many instances, the debt financing is non recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guarantees. 45 Table of Contents Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the joint venture participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other joint venture participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes. The joint ventures often enter into option agreements with buyers, which may include us or other joint venture participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements. As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint ventures activities and the stage in the joint ventures life cycle. We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our joint ventures. For purposes of classifying distributions received from joint ventures in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities. Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows: Statements of Operations and Selected Information Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 236,752 339,993 862,728 Costs and expenses 378,997 1,212,866 1,394,601 Net loss of unconsolidated entities (1) $ (142,245 ) (872,873 ) (531,873 ) Our share of net loss $ (13,301 ) (131,138 ) (55,598 ) Our share of net loss recognized (2) $ (10,966 ) (130,917 ) (59,156 ) Our cumulative share of net earnings deferred at November 30 $ 8,689 12,052 21,491 Our investments in unconsolidated entities $ 626,185 599,266 766,752 Equity of the unconsolidated entities $ 2,148,610 2,249,289 2,688,365 Our investment % in the unconsolidated entities 29 % 27 % 29 % (1) The net loss of unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009 was primarily related to valuation adjustments and operating losses recorded by the unconsolidated entities. Our exposure to such losses was significantly lower as a result of our small ownership interest in the respective unconsolidated entities or our previous valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. In addition, for the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million from a transaction related to one of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. (2) For the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our share of net loss recognized from unconsolidated entities includes $10.5 million, $101.9 million and $32.2 million, respectively, of our share of valuation adjustments related to assets of the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. 46 Table of Contents Balance Sheets November 30, 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 82,573 171,946 Inventories 3,371,435 3,628,491 Other assets 307,244 403,383 $ 3,761,252 4,203,820 Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 327,824 366,141 Debt 1,284,818 1,588,390 Equity 2,148,610 2,249,289 $ 3,761,252 4,203,820 In fiscal 2007, we sold a portfolio of land to a strategic land investment venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., in which we have a 20% ownership interest and 50% voting rights. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory has remained on our consolidated balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned. As of November 30, 2010 and 2009, the portfolio of land (including land development costs) of $424.5 million and $477.9 million, respectively, is reflected as inventory in the summarized condensed financial information related to unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. In February 2007, LandSource Communities Development LLC (LandSource) admitted MW Housing Partners as a new strategic partner. As a result we received a distribution from LandSource of $707.6 million and our ownership in LandSource was reduced to 16%. In June 2008, LandSource and a number of its subsidiaries commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In November 2008, our land purchase options with LandSource were terminated, thus, in 2008, we recognized a deferred profit of $101.3 million (net of $31.8 million of write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs and other write offs) related to the 2007 recapitalization of LandSource. In July 2009, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the plan of reorganization for LandSource. As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, LandSource was reorganized into a new company called Newhall Land Development, LLC, (Newhall). The reorganized company emerged from Chapter 11 free of its previous bank debt. As part of the reorganization plan, during the year ended November 30, 2009, we invested $140 million in exchange for approximately 15% equity interest in the reorganized Newhall, ownership in several communities that were formerly owned by LandSource, the settlement and release of all claims that might have been asserted against us and certain other claims LandSource had against third parties. Debt to total capital of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was calculated as follows: November 30, 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Debt $ 1,284,818 1,588,390 Equity 2,148,610 2,249,289 Total capital $ 3,433,428 3,837,679 Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities 37.4 % 41.4 % Our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows: November 30, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Land development $ 530,004 555,799 Homebuilding 96,181 43,467 Total investment $ 626,185 599,266 47 Table of Contents During the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded $10.5 million of our share of valuation adjustments related to the assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, compared to $101.9 million for the year ended November 30, 2009. In addition, we recorded $1.7 million and $89.0 million, respectively, of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009. We will continue to monitor our investments in joint ventures and the recoverability of assets owned by those joint ventures. The summary of our net recourse exposure related to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was as follows: November 30, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Several recourse debt repayment $ 33,399 42,691 Several recourse debt maintenance 29,454 75,238 Joint and several recourse debt repayment 48,406 85,799 Joint and several recourse debt maintenance 61,591 81,592 Land seller debt and other debt recourse exposure 2,420 Lennars maximum recourse exposure 172,850 287,740 Less: joint and several reimbursement agreements with our partners (58,878 ) (93,185 ) Lennars net recourse exposure $ 113,972 194,555 During the year ended November 30, 2010, we reduced our maximum recourse exposure related to indebtedness of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities by $114.9 million, of which $82.5 million was paid by us primarily through capital contributions to unconsolidated entities and $32.4 million related to a reduction in the number of joint ventures in which we have investments, the reduction of joint and several recourse debt and the joint ventures selling inventory. As of November 30, 2010, we had $10.2 million of obligation guarantees recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet, compared to $14.1 million as of November 30, 2009. During the year ended November 30, 2010, the liability was reduced by $11.0 million as a result of the debt extinguishment related to one of our unconsolidated entities and by $2.1 million due to cash paid related to an obligation guarantee previously recorded. This was partially offset by an accrual of $9.2 million established by us to cover claims arising under obligation guarantees. The obligation guarantees are estimated based on current facts and circumstances and any unexpected changes may lead us to incur additional liabilities under our obligation guarantees in the future. Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. Some unconsolidated entities own multiple properties and other assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt to different unconsolidated entities. We also do not use our investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt in another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among our unconsolidated entities. In connection with a loan to an unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any, or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee). In connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity where there is a joint and several guarantee, we generally have a reimbursement agreement with our partner. The reimbursement agreement provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee. However, if our joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The recourse debt exposure in the previous table represents our maximum exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are 48 Table of Contents available to repay debt or to reimburse us for any payments on our guarantees. Our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities that have recourse debt have a significant amount of assets and equity. The summarized balance sheets of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities with recourse debt were as follows. November 30, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Assets $ 990,028 1,324,993 Liabilities 487,606 777,836 Equity 502,422 547,157 In addition, in most instances in which we have guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, our partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payment. Some of our guarantees are repayment guarantees and some are maintenance guarantees. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. In the event of default, if our venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum recourse exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would generally constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes. In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, we and our joint venture partners (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used. During the year ended November 30, 2010, there were: (1) payments of $10.0 million under our maintenance guarantees, (2) at our election, a loan paydown of $50.3 million, representing both our and our partners share, in return for 4 year loan extension and the rights to obtain preferred returns and priority distributions at one of our unconsolidated entities, and (3) a $19.3 million payment to extinguish debt at a discount and buy out the partner of one of our unconsolidated entities resulting in a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million. In addition, during the year ended November 30, 2010, there were other loan paydowns of $28.1 million, a portion of which related to amounts paid under our repayment guarantees. During the year ended November 30, 2009, there were payments of $31.6 million under our maintenance guarantees and there were other loan repayments of $72.4 million, a portion of which related to amounts paid under our repayment guarantees. During the years ended November 30, 2010, there were no payments under completion guarantees. During the years ended November 30, 2009, there was a payment of $5.6 million under a completion guarantee related to one joint venture. As of November 30, 2010, the fair values of the maintenance guarantees, completion guarantees and repayment guarantees were not material. We believe that as of November 30, 2010, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, most of the time the collateral should be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. 49 Table of Contents The total debt of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was as follows: November 30, 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Lennars net recourse exposure $ 113,972 194,555 Reimbursement agreements from partners 58,878 93,185 Lennars maximum recourse exposure 172,850 287,740 Non recourse bank debt and other debt (partners share of several recourse) 79,921 140,078 Non recourse land seller debt or other debt 58,604 47,478 Non recourse debt with completion guarantees 600,297 608,397 Non recourse debt without completion guarantees 373,146 504,697 Non recourse debt to Lennar 1,111,968 1,300,650 Total debt $ 1,284,818 1,588,390 Lennars maximum recourse exposure as a % of total JV debt 13 % 18 % In view of current credit market conditions, it is not uncommon for lenders to real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, to assert non monetary defaults (such as failure to meet construction completion deadlines or declines in the market value of collateral below required amounts) or technical monetary defaults against the real estate developers. In most instances, those asserted defaults are resolved by modifications of the loan terms, additional equity investments or other concessions by the borrowers. In addition, in some instances, real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are forced to request temporary waivers of covenants in loan documents or modifications of loan terms, which are often, but not always obtained. However, in some instances developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are not able to meet their monetary obligations to lenders, and are thus declared in default. Because we sometimes guarantee all or portions of the obligations to lenders of joint ventures in which we have interests, when these joint ventures default on their obligations, lenders may or may not have claims against us. Normally, we do not make payments with regard to guarantees of joint venture obligations while the joint ventures are contesting assertions regarding sums due to their lenders. When it is determined that a joint venture is obligated to make a payment that we have guaranteed and the joint venture will not be able to make that payment, we accrue the amounts probable to be paid by us as a liability. Although we generally fulfill our guarantee obligations within a reasonable time after we determine that we are obligated with regard to them, at any point in time it is likely that we will have some balance of unpaid guarantee liability. At November 30, 2010, the liability for unpaid guarantees of joint venture indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $10.2 million. The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities (JVs) debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2010 and does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. Many JV loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.

The PPIP matches private capital with public capital and financing provided by the U.S. Treasury, which provides an opportunity for private investors to invest in certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities and CMBS issued prior to 2009 that were originally rated AAA, or an equivalent rating, by two or more nationally recognized statistical organizations without ratings enhancements. These securities are backed directly by actual mortgage loans and not by other securities. During fiscal 2009, we committed to invest $75 million in the Federal governments PPIP fund managed by AB. An affiliate of Rialto is a sub advisor to the AB PPIP fund and receives management fees for sub advisory services. Total equity commitments of approximately $1.2 billion were made by private investors in this fund, and the U.S. Treasury has committed to a matching amount of approximately $1.2 billion of equity in the fund, as well as agreeing to extend up to approximately $2.3 billion of debt financing. As of November 30, 2010, 85% of committed capital has been called including our portion, $63.8 million of the $75 million we committed to invest. As of November 30, 2010, the AB PPIP has invested approximately $4.0 billion to purchase $6.4 billion in face amount of non agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities and it is reflected in investments in the summarized condensed balance sheets of Rialtos unconsolidated entities. The gross yield of the fund since its inception has totaled approximately 39%. As of November 30, 2010, the carrying value of our investment in the AB PPIP fund was $77.3 million. In November 2010, our Rialto segment completed the closing of its Fund with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by us). The Funds objective during its three year investment period is to invest in distressed real estate assets and other related investments that fit within the Funds investment parameters. As of November 30, 2010, a subsidiary in our Rialto segment also has a $7.3 million, or approximately 5%, investment in the Service Provider, which provides services to the consolidated LLCs. 52 Table of Contents Summarized condensed financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Rialtos investment in unconsolidated entities in which Rialto has investments that are accounted for by the equity method as of November 30, 2010 was as follows: Balance Sheets November 30, 2010 2009 (1) (In thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 42,793 2,229 Investments 4,341,226 Other assets 181,600 179,985 $ 4,565,619 182,214 Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 110,921 58,209 Partner loans 137,820 135,570 Debt due to the U.S. Treasury 1,955,000 Equity 2,361,878 (11,565 ) $ 4,565,619 182,214 Years EndedNovember 30, Statements of Operations 2010 2009 (1) (In thousands) Revenues $ 357,330 58,464 Costs and expenses 209,103 89,570 Other gains 311,468 Net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities $ 459,695 (31,106 ) Rialto Investments share of net earnings recognized $ 15,363 (1) Amounts included as of and for the year ended November 30, 2009 relate only to the Service Provider because the Company did not invest in the AB PPIP fund until December 2009. Option Contracts We have access to land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. Until recently, these option deposits generally have approximated 10% of the exercise price. Our option contracts sometimes include price adjustment provisions, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at the time of acquisition or are based on fair value at the time of takedown. The exercise periods of our option contracts generally range from one to ten years. Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options. Some option contracts contain a predetermined take down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, we are not required to purchase land in accordance with those take down schedules. In substantially all instances, we have the right and ability to not exercise our option and forfeit our deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of our deposit and pre acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, we do not consider the take down price to be a firm contractual obligation. When we intend not to exercise an option, we write off any deposit and pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. For the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we wrote off $3.1 million, $84.4 million and $97.2 million, respectively, of option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase. 53 Table of Contents The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties (optioned) or unconsolidated joint ventures (JVs) (i.e., controlled homesites) at November 30, 2010 and 2009: November 30, 2010 Controlled Homesites OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites Optioned JVs Total East 4,856 1,631 6,487 26,565 33,052 Central 1,061 1,721 2,782 16,236 19,018 West 304 7,753 8,057 26,213 34,270 Houston 1,431 305 1,736 5,926 7,662 Other 838 74 912 9,542 10,454 Total homesites 8,490 11,484 19,974 84,482 104,456 Controlled Homesites OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites November 30, 2009 Optioned JVs Total East 4,701 1,900 6,601 28,406 35,007 Central 1,273 2,381 3,654 15,607 19,261 West 78 7,667 7,745 24,770 32,515 Houston 901 1,728 2,629 6,672 9,301 Other 470 74 544 7,248 7,792 Total homesites 7,423 13,750 21,173 82,703 103,876 We evaluate all option contracts for land when entered into or upon a reconsideration event to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, we are required to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During the year ended November 30, 2010, the effect of consolidation of these option contracts was a net increase of $19.8 million to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in our consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2010. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, we reclassified the related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2010. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits. However, consolidated inventory not owned decreased due to (1) our exercise of options to acquire land under certain contracts previously consolidated and (2) the deconsolidation of certain option contracts totaling $75.5 million related to the adoption of certain new provisions under ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, (ASC 810), resulting in a net decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of $139.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2010. Our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $157.4 million and $127.4 million, respectively, at November 30, 2010 and 2009. Additionally, we had posted $48.9 million and $58.2 million, respectively, of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November 30, 2010 and 2009. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2010: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years (In thousands) Lennar Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 3,128,154 206,985 591,530 784,188 1,545,451 Lennar Financial Services Notes and other debts payable 271,678 271,623 42 13 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt (1) 940,502 177,096 314,100 248,010 201,296 Rialto Investments Notes payable (2) 752,302 503,907 222,000 26,395 Operating leases 115,254 35,031 40,730 24,012 15,481 Other contractual obligations (3) 86,185 86,185 Total contractual obligations (4) $ 5,294,075 776,920 1,450,309 1,278,223 1,788,623 (1) Interest commitments on variable interest bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of November 30, 2010. (2) Amount includes $626.9 million of notes payable that consolidated as part of the LLC consolidation related to the FDIC transaction and is non recourse to Lennar; however, $101.3 million of cash collections on loans in excess of expenses was deposited in a defeasance account established for the repayment of the notes payable. The notes payable have extension provisions which could extend the maturity of amounts due for up to seven years from origination. (3) Commitments to fund Rialto segments equity investments ($11.2 million in the AB PPIP fund and $75 million in the Fund). (4) Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $46.0 million as of November 30, 2010, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2010, we had access to 19,974 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2010, we had $157.4 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and $48.9 million of letters of credit posted in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts. At November 30, 2010, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $273.9 million (which included the $48.9 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2010, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects in our joint ventures) of $684.7 million. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2010, there were approximately $314.7 million, or 46%, of costs to complete related to these site improvements. We do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds, but if any such draws occur, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Lennar Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $546.9 million at November 30, 2010. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers and builder commitments for loan programs totaled $202.3 million as of November 30, 2010. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure. 55 Table of Contents These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At November 30, 2010, we had open commitments amounting to $270.8 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2011. The following sections discuss economic conditions, market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business: Economic Conditions Throughout 2010, market conditions in the homebuilding industry have remained challenging. High unemployment and foreclosures have continued to present challenges for the housing market. Despite a decrease of 5% in our sales of homes revenue, home deliveries and new orders year over year, our gross margins on home sales improved to $517.9 million, or 19.7%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, from $252.0 million, or 9.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2009. The improvement in gross margins was primarily due to lower valuation adjustments, reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales, reduced construction costs and product re engineering, as well as third party recoveries relating to Chinese drywall. In addition, during the year ended November 30, 2010, we returned to profitability with net earnings of $95.3 million , or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $417.1 million, or $2.45 per diluted share during the year ended November 30, 2009. A continued decline in the sales pace could adversely affect our revenues and margins. Market and Financing Risk We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Rialto activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations, debt issuances, equity issuances, as well as borrowings under our warehouse repurchase facilities. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the option. We tried to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believed to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we viewed as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and, until recent years, limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative, we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered since 2007. Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period, like the current period, of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, (ASU 2010 06), which requires additional disclosures about transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. We adopted ASU 2010 06 for our second quarter ending May 31, 2010, except for the Level 3 activity disclosures which will be effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2011. ASU 2010 06 has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 56 Table of Contents In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 18, Effect of a Loan Modification When the Loan Is Part of a Pool That Is Accounted for as a Single Asset, (ASU 2010 18). Under ASU 2010 18, modification of loans accounted for within a pool under ASC Topic 310 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, (ASC 310 30) does not result in removal of such loans from the pool even if the modification would otherwise be considered a troubled debt restructuring. An entity must continue to consider whether the pool of assets in which the modified loan is included is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change. ASU 2010 18 does not affect the accounting for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality that are not accounted for within a pool. Loans accounted for individually that were acquired with deteriorated credit quality continue to be subject to the accounting provisions for troubled debt restructuring by creditors. The amended guidance is to be applied prospectively, with early application permitted. ASU 2010 18 is effective for modifications of loans accounted for within a pool that occur on or after September 1, 2010. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 20, Disclosures About the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses, (ASU 2010 20). ASU 2010 20 enhances current disclosure requirements to assist users of financial statements in assessing an entitys credit risk exposure and evaluating the adequacy of an entitys allowance for credit losses. ASU 2010 20 requires entities to disclose the nature of credit risk inherent in their finance receivables, the procedure for analyzing and assessing credit risk, and the changes in both the receivables and the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment and class. ASU 2010 20 is effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2010. We are evaluating the effect the ASU will have on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are assessed each reporting period by us based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. Based upon an evaluation of all available evidence, we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $730.8 million during the year ended November 30, 2008, and increased it by $269.6 million during the year ended November 30, 2009. In addition, for the year ended November 30, 2009, we recorded a reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $351.8 million, primarily due to a change in tax legislation, which allowed us to carry back our fiscal year 2009 tax loss to recover previously paid income taxes. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $37.9 million primarily due to the recording of a deferred tax liability from the issuance of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes, and the net earnings generated 57 Table of Contents during the year. The reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the issuance of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. At November 30, 2010 and 2009, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $609.5 million and $647.4 million, respectively. In future periods, the allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized. At both November 30, 2010 and 2009, we had no net deferred tax assets. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results, which may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Lennar Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were 440 and 390 active communities as of November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its fair value. In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins on homes with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, we identify communities whose carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. Although gross margins for all of our homebuilding segments, and Homebuilding Other, except Homebuilding Houston, have improved for the year ended November 30, 2010, revenues of our Homebuilding Central, Homebuilding West and Homebuilding Houston segments decreased 4%, 20% and 17%, respectively, for the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 due to a decrease in absorption pace. We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as the current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above. For example, since the start of the downturn in the housing market, we have found ways to reduce our construction costs in many communities, and this reduction in construction costs in addition to changes in product type in many communities has impacted future estimated cash flows. 58 Table of Contents Each of the homebuilding markets in which we operate is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of our homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. Our projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver our homes on a community by community basis. In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in our cash flow models, we analyze our historical absorption pace in the community as well as other communities in the geographical area. In addition, we analyze internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing our historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies, we place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in our most recent quarters as well as forecasted population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product. Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace in the cash flow model for a community. In order to determine the assumed sales prices included in our cash flow models, we analyze the historical sales prices realized on homes we delivered in the community and other communities in the geographical area as well as the sales prices included in our current backlog for such communities. In addition, we analyze internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices on similar products in non neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing our historical sales prices and corresponding market studies, we also place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as future forecasted sales prices in neighboring communities as well as future forecasted sales prices for similar product in non neighboring communities. Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected sales prices in the cash flow model for a community. In order to arrive at our assumed costs to build and deliver our homes, we generally assume a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Costs assumed in our cash flow models for our communities are generally based on the rates we are currently obligated to pay under existing contracts with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Due to the fact that the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future. Using all the available trend information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. We generally use a discount rate of approximately 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. We estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. For example, further market deterioration or changes in our assumptions may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory, as well as on inventory not currently impaired, but for which indicators of impairment may arise if further market deterioration occurs. We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or 59 Table of Contents irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. Our option contracts are recorded at cost. In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property that is the subject of the option. If we intend to walk away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and related pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, managements projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded the following inventory impairments: Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes (1) $ 44,717 180,239 195,518 Valuation adjustments to land we intend to sell or have sold to third parties 3,436 95,314 47,791 Write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs 3,105 84,372 97,172 Total inventory impairments $ 51,258 359,925 340,481 (1) Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 relate to 33 communities, 131 communities and 146 communities, respectively. The valuation adjustments were estimated based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the valuation adjustments were recorded, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and Homebuilding Other. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2010, the reserve for warranty costs was $109.2 million, which included $23.3 million related to defective drywall manufactured in China that was purchased and installed by various of our subcontractors. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that 60 Table of Contents historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as Lennar Homebuilding Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. Management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2010, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2010, the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $3.8 billion and total liabilities of $1.6 billion. We evaluate our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The evaluation of our investment in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. Such inventory is also reviewed for potential impairment by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. The review for inventory impairment performed by our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities is materially consistent with our process, as discussed above, for evaluating our own inventory as of the end of a reporting period. The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of approximately 20% in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share of it is reflected in our Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our Lennar Homebuilding investment in unconsolidated entities. In certain instances, we may be required to record additional losses relating to our Lennar Homebuilding investment in unconsolidated entities; such losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived. 61 Table of Contents In addition, we believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future. Additionally, we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other than temporary. These factors include age of the venture, intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity, financial condition and long term prospects of the entity, short term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investments, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded. During the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded the following valuation adjustments related to our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities: Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Our share of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities $ 10,461 101,893 32,245 Valuation adjustments to our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities 1,735 88,972 172,790 Total valuation adjustments to our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities $ 12,196 190,865 205,035 These valuation adjustments were calculated based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the valuation adjustments were recorded, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and homebuilding other. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. The accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment. Generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared between all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JVs assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market. 62 Table of Contents Generally, our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions. Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policies. Escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held for sale and loans held for investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Loan Origination Liabilities Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreement. There has been an increased industry wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses in an unfavorable economic environment by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. Our mortgage operations has established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received, our actual past repurchases, and losses through the disposition of affected loans. While we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses known and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimate. Goodwill At both November 30, 2010 and 2009, our goodwill was $34.0 million, which is part of our Lennar Financial Services segment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis. Inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or whenever indicators of impairment exist) for impairment. Due to operating losses in the title operations of our Lennar Financial Services segment through the nine months ended August 31, 2010 and other factors, we evaluated the carrying value of our Lennar Financial Services segments goodwill in both our third and fourth quarters of 2010. The evaluations concluded that an impairment was not required for our Lennar Financial Services segments goodwill during 2010. During the year ended November 30, 2009, we did not record goodwill impairment charges. During the year ended November 30, 2008, we impaired $27.2 million of our Lennar Financial Services segments goodwill. As of November 30, 2010 and 2009, there were no material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill. For our review of the Lennar Financial Services segments goodwill during the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, we determined the fair value of our Lennar Financial Services segment based entirely on the 63 Table of Contents income approach due to a lack of guideline companies with adequate comparisons to our Lennar Financial Services segment on a stand alone basis. The income approach establishes fair value by methods which discount or capitalize earnings and or cash flow by a discount or capitalization rate that reflects market rate of return expectations, market conditions and the risk of the relative investment. We used a discounted cash flow method when applying the income approach. This analysis includes operating income, interest expense, taxes and incremental working capital, as well as other factors. The projections used in the analysis are for a five year period and represent what we consider to be normalized earnings. In determining the fair value of our Lennar Financial Services segment under the income approach, our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions. The most significant assumptions affecting our expected cash flows are the discount rate, projected revenue growth rate and operating profit margin. The impact of a change in any of our significant underlying assumptions +/ 1% would not result in a materially different fair value. Rialto Investments Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality All of the acquired loans for which (1) there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and (2) for which it was deemed probable that we would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments were accounted under ASC Topic 310 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, (ASC 310 30). For loans accounted for under ASC 310 30, management determined upon acquisition the loans value based on extensive due diligence on each of the loans, the underlying properties and the borrowers. We determined fair value by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider when determining fair value. Factors considered in the valuation were projected cash flows for the loans, type of loan and related collateral, classification status and current discount rates. Since the estimates are based on projections, all estimates are subjective and can change due to unexpected changes in economic conditions and loan performance. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting related to loans with deteriorated credit quality is a critical accounting policy. Revenue Recognition Accretable Yield Under ASC 310 30, loans were pooled together according to common risk characteristics. The excess of the cash flows expected to be collected from the loans receivable at acquisition over the initial investment for those loans receivable is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the expected life of the pools primarily using the effective yield method. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. Changes in the expected cash flows of loans receivable from the date of acquisition will either impact the accretable yield or result in a charge to the provision for loan losses in the period in which the changes become probable. Prepayments are treated as a reduction of cash flows expected to be collected and a reduction of contractually required payments such that the nonaccretable difference is not affected. Subsequent significant decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a charge to the provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses, and a reclassification from accretable yield to nonaccretable difference. Subsequent probable and significant increases in cash flows will result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield. Amounts related to the ASC 310 30 loans are estimates and may change as we obtain additional information related to the respective loans and the inherent uncertainty associated with estimating the amount and timing of the expected cash flows associated with distressed residential and commercial real estate loans. The timing and amount of expected cash flows and related accretable yield can also be impacted by disposal of loans, loans payoffs or expected foreclosures, which result in removal of the loans from the pools. Since the cash flows are based on projections, they are subjective and can change due to unexpected changes in economic conditions and loan performance. We believe that the accretable yield is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required. Nonaccrual Loans Revenue Recognition & Impairment Management classifies certain loans as nonaccrual and discontinues accruing interest income when future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, unpaid accrued interest income recognized is reversed and any subsequent cash receipt is accounted for using either the cost recovery or cash basis method. Loans are generally returned to accrual status when payments are made that bring the loan account current under the terms of the agreement or when the loan becomes well secured and is in 64 Table of Contents the process of collection. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, the carrying value of the receivable is in excess of its fair value. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral. If we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we recognize impairment through an allowance estimate or a charge off to the allowance. Real Estate Owned Real estate owned represents real estate which our Rialto segment has taken control of in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell, which becomes the propertys new basis. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater or less than the REOs fair value (net of estimated cost to sell), is recorded as a gain or loss on foreclosure within Rialto Investments other income, net, in our consolidated statement of operations. Subsequently, management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent valuation adjustments, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in Rialto Investments other income, net. We believe that the accounting for REO is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required. 65 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The table below provides information at November 30, 2010 about our significant financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For loans held for sale, loans held for investment, net and investments held to maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values at November 30, 2010. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2010. Rialto Investments loans receivable are not included in the table below because income is recorded through accretable yield due to the loans acquired having deteriorated credit quality, thus we believe they are not sensitive to changes in interest rates. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2010. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2010 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein. 67 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of November 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2010 of the Company and our report dated January 31, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to retrospective adjustments for the adoption of certain accounting standards related to the presentation of noncontrolling interests and the disclosure guidance applicable to variable interest entities and the adoption of other provisions of the amended consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain option contracts. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Certified Public Accountants Miami, Florida January 31, 2011 68 Table of Contents
