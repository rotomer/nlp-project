Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. You can identify forward looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward looking statements. These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements, except as required by Federal securities laws. Outlook As we closed out fiscal 2011 and commenced operations in 2012, we have seen fundamental shifts and resulting trends that indicate the housing market has started to stabilize. This stabilization has been driven by a combination of low home prices and low interest rates, making the decision for qualified homebuyers to buy a home more attractive than the escalating cost of renting. In many markets, the all inclusive cost of homeownership including principal, interest, taxes, mortgage and property insurance and community association costs is lower than the rising rental rates for comparable space. Also, buying with a fixed rate mortgage provides greater living cost stability than renting. Overall, we are experiencing more traffic in our communities, and have seen a more consistent sales pace at stabilized prices during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and into fiscal 2012 as reflected in our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter new orders and sales backlog, which increased 20% and 35%, respectively, from the prior year. In fiscal 2012, our principal focus in our homebuilding operations will continue to be on maintaining and improving our operating margin on the homes we sell. We have taken steps over the past several years to reduce costs and right size our overhead structure. We have also repositioned our product offering to target first time and value focused homebuyers. In addition, we continue to invest in carefully underwritten strategic land acquisitions in well positioned markets that will continue to support our homebuilding operations going forward. Our Financial Services segment will continue to transition for recovery while remaining profitable, as it did in fiscal 2011, and our Rialto Investments segment also produced profitability during fiscal 2011 as it continued to grow its business. In addition, the Rialto Investment segment completed raising money for its first fund during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and ended fiscal 2011 with a $700 million pool of capital that is being invested in strategic assets and is expected to drive future profitability. As we enter fiscal 2012, we believe that all the segments of our company are well positioned. Our homebuilding operations are on track to achieve profitability in 2012 as the housing market stabilizes and ultimately recovers and our financial services and Rialto Investments segments will continue to enhance our earnings. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview Our net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2011 were $92.2 million, or $0.48 per basic and diluted share, compared to $95.3 million, or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, in 2010. The following table sets forth financial and operational information for the years indicated related to our operations.

See the Non GAAP Financial Measures section. 2011 versus 2010 For both the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010, revenues from home sales were $2.6 billion. There was a 1% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered, offset by a 1% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 10,746 homes in the year ended November 30, 2011 from 10,859 homes last year. The decrease in home deliveries was primarily in our Homebuilding Houston and Homebuilding West segments and Homebuilding Other as a result of the absence of the Federal homebuyer tax credit, partially offset by an increase in home deliveries in our Homebuilding Southeast Florida segment. The increase in deliveries in our 23 Table of Contents Homebuilding Southeast Florida segment was the result of an increase in home deliveries from communities acquired in the prior year that had sales but only a small amount of deliveries during the year ended November 30, 2010. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $244,000 in the year ended November 30, 2011 from $243,000 in the same period last year, driven primarily by an increase in the average sales price of home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, except for our Homebuilding West segment, primarily due to a higher percentage of home deliveries in higher priced communities. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in average sales price in our Homebuilding West segment due to a shift to smaller square footage homes generating a lower average sales price. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $33,700 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2011, or 12.1% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $32,800 per home delivered in the same period last year, or 11.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue. Currently, our biggest competition is from the sales of existing and foreclosed homes. We differentiate our new homes from those homes by issuing new home warranty, and in certain markets emphasizing energy efficiency and new technology such as keyless door locks and lighting and thermostats controlled remotely from outside the home. Gross margins on home sales were $523.4 million, or 19.9%, in the year ended November 30, 2011, which included $35.7 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $517.9 million, or 19.7%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included $44.7 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales, excluding valuation adjustments, were $559.1 million, or 21.3%, in the year ended November 30, 2011, compared to $562.6 million, or 21.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2010. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure, which is discussed in the Non GAAP Financial Measures section. Gross profits on land sales totaled $7.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2011, net of $0.5 million of valuation adjustments and $1.8 million in write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs, compared to gross profits on land sales of $21.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, primarily due to a $14.1 million reduction of an obligation related to a profit participation agreement. Gross profits on land sales for the year ended November 30, 2010 were net of $3.4 million of valuation adjustments and $3.1 million in write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $384.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2011, which included $8.4 million related to additional expenses associated with remedying pre existing liabilities of a previously acquired company, offset by $8.0 million related to the receipt of a settlement discussed below. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $377.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 14.7% in the year ended November 30, 2011, from 14.3% in 2010. Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $62.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2011, which primarily included our share of valuation adjustments of $57.6 million related to an asset distribution from a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity as the result of a linked transaction. This was offset by a pre tax gain of $62.3 million included in Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, related to that unconsolidated entitys net asset distribution. The transaction resulted in a net pre tax gain of $4.7 million. In addition, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities included $8.9 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities, offset by our share of a gain on debt extinguishment at one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities totaling $15.4 million. In the year ended November 30, 2010, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.0 million, which included $10.5 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million as a result of a transaction by one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities. Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, totaled $116.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2011, which included the $62.3 million pre tax gain discussed above and $29.5 million related to the receipt of a settlement. The parties to certain litigation in which the Company was plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement in which they agreed the Company may make the following statement: Lennar recently settled litigation against a third party in connection with Lennars ongoing dispute with Nicolas Marsch, III and his affiliates. As a result of the settlement, the third party paid Lennar total cash consideration of $37.5 million and that the terms are confidential. Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, in the year ended November 30, 2011 also included $5.1 million related to the favorable resolution of a joint venture and the recognition of $10.0 million of deferred management fees related to management services previously performed for one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities. These amounts were partially offset by $10.5 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities. In the year ended November 30, 2010, Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, was $19.1 million, which included a $19.4 million pre tax gain on the extinguishment of other debt and other income, partially offset by a pre tax loss of $10.8 million related to the repurchase of senior notes through a tender offer. Homebuilding interest expense was $163.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2011 ($70.7 million was included in cost of homes sold, $1.6 million in cost of land sold and $90.7 million in other interest expense), compared to $143.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2010 ($71.5 million was included in cost of homes sold, $2.0 million in cost of land sold and $70.4 million in other interest expense). Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt compared to the same period last year. 24 Table of Contents Operating earnings for our Lennar Financial Services segment were $20.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2011, compared to operating earnings of $31.3 million in the same period last year. The decrease in profitability was due primarily to decreased volume in the segments mortgage operations. In addition, in the year ended November 30, 2010, our Lennar Financial Services segment received $5.1 million of proceeds from the previous sale of a cable system. In the year ended November 30, 2011, operating earnings in our Rialto Investments segment were $63.5 million (which included $28.9 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to operating earnings of $57.3 million (which included $33.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the same period last year. In the year ended November 30, 2011, revenues in this segment were $164.7 million, which consisted primarily of accretable interest income associated with the segments portfolio of real estate loans and fees for managing and servicing assets, compared to revenues of $92.6 million in the same period last year. In the year ended November 30, 2011, Rialto Investments other income, net, was $39.2 million, which consisted primarily of gains from acquisition of real estate owned (REO) through foreclosure, as well as gains from real estate sales, partially offset by expenses related to owning and maintaining those assets, and a $4.7 million gain on the sale of investment securities. In the year ended November 30, 2010, Rialto Investments other income, net, was $17.3 million, which consisted primarily of gains from acquisition of real estate owned through foreclosure as well as gains from real estate sales. The segment also had equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of ($7.9) million in the year ended November 30, 2011, consisting primarily of $21.4 million of unrealized losses related to our share of the mark to market adjustments of the investment portfolio underlying the AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB) fund formed under the Federal governments Public Private Investment Program (PPIP), partially offset by interest and other income earned by the AB PPIP fund and $2.9 million of equity in earnings related to the Rialto Investments Real Estate Fund (the Fund). This compares to equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities of $15.4 million in the same period last year, which included $9.3 million of unrealized gains related to our share of the mark to market adjustments of AB PPIP investments. In the year ended November 30, 2011, expenses in this segment were $132.6 million, which consisted primarily of costs related to its portfolio operations, due diligence expenses related to both completed and abandoned transactions, and other general and administrative expenses, compared to expenses of $67.9 million in the same period last year. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $95.3 million, or 3.1% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2011, compared to $93.9 million, or 3.1% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2010. Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were $20.3 million and $25.2 million, respectively, in the year ended November 30, 2011 and 2010. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during both the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC. A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Based upon an evaluation of all available evidence, during the year ended November 30, 2011, we recorded a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $32.6 million, primarily due to net earnings generated during the year. At November 30, 2011, we owned 94,684 homesites and had access to an additional 16,702 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2011, 1% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 2,171 homes ($560.7 million) at November 30, 2011, compared to 1,604 homes ($407.3 million) at November 30, 2010. 2010 versus 2009 Revenues from home sales decreased 5% in the year ended November 30, 2010 to $2.6 billion from $2.8 billion in 2009. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 5% decrease in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, decreased to 10,859 homes in the year ended November 30, 2010 from 11,422 homes in 2009. The decrease in home deliveries was primarily in our Homebuilding West and Homebuilding Houston segments as a result of reduced demand due to expiration of the Federal homebuyer tax credit at the end of April 2010, partially offset by an increase in home deliveries in our Homebuilding East and Homebuilding Southeast Florida segments as a result of an increase in active community count. The average sales price of homes delivered for both the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009 was $243,000. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $32,800 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2010, or 11.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $44,800 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2009, or 15.6% as a percentage of home sales revenue. 25 Table of Contents Gross margins on home sales were $517.9 million, or 19.7%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included $44.7 million of valuation adjustments, compared to gross margins on home sales of $252.0 million, or 9.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $180.2 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments were $562.6 million, or 21.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to $432.2 million, or 15.6%, in 2009. Gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding valuation adjustments, improved compared to 2009, due primarily to reduced valuation adjustments, reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales, reduced construction costs and product re engineering, as well as third party recoveries related to Chinese drywall. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments is a non GAAP financial measure, which is discussed in the Non GAAP Financial Measures section. Selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $72.3 million, or 16%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to reductions in legal, personnel and occupancy expenses. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 14.3% in the year ended November 30, 2010, from 16.2% in 2009. Gross profits on land sales totaled $21.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, primarily due to the reduction of an obligation related to a profit participation agreement. Gross profits on land sales were net of $3.4 million of valuation adjustments and $3.1 million in write offs of deposits and pre acquisitions costs. Losses on land sales totaled $178.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $108.9 million of valuation adjustments and $84.4 million in write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs. Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included $10.5 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. In the year ended November 30, 2009, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $130.9 million, which included $101.9 million of valuation adjustments related to assets of unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, totaled $19.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, which included a $19.4 million pre tax gain on the extinguishment of other debt and other income, partially offset by a $10.8 million pre tax loss related to the repurchase of senior notes through a tender offer and $1.7 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities. Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, totaled ($98.4) million in the year ended November 30, 2009, which included $89.0 million of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities and $9.7 million of write offs of notes and other receivables. Homebuilding interest expense was $143.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2010 ($71.5 million was included in cost of homes sold, $2.0 million in cost of land sold and $70.4 million in other interest expense), compared to $147.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2009 ($67.4 million was included in cost of homes sold, $9.2 million in cost of land sold and $70.9 million in other interest expense). Despite an increase in debt, interest expense decreased primarily due to an increase in qualifying assets eligible for interest capitalization and savings resulting from the termination of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2010. Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were $31.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to $36.0 million in 2009. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to decreased volume in the segments mortgage and title operations. In the year ended November 30, 2010, operating earnings in our Rialto Investments segment were $57.3 million (which included $33.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to an operating loss of $2.5 million in 2009. In the year ended November 30, 2010, revenues in this segment were $92.6 million, which consisted primarily of accretable interest income associated with the portfolios of real estate loans acquired in partnership with the FDIC. In the year ended November 30, 2010, other income, net was $17.3 million, which consisted primarily of gains from acquisition of REO through foreclosure, as well as gains from real estate sales. The segment also had equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities of $15.4 million during the year ended November 30, 2010, consisting primarily of $9.3 million of unrealized gains related to our share of the mark to market adjustments of AB PPIP investments. In the year ended November 30, 2010, expenses in this segment were $67.9 million, which consisted primarily of costs related to its portfolio operations, management of investments for others, due diligence expenses related to both completed and abandoned transactions, and other general and administrative expenses. 26 Table of Contents Corporate general and administrative expenses were reduced by $23.6 million, or 20%, in the year ended November 30, 2010, compared to 2009 primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives implemented during the downturn. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses decreased to 3.1% in the year ended November 30, 2010, from 3.8% in 2009. Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were $25.2 million and ($28.9) million, respectively, in the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2010 were primarily related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC. A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Based upon an evaluation of all available evidence, during the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $37.9 million, primarily due to the recording of a deferred tax liability from the issuance of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 and the net earnings generated during the year. The reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the issuance of the 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. At November 30, 2010, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $609.5 million. At November 30, 2010, we owned 84,482 homesites and had access to an additional 19,974 homesites through either option contracts with third parties or agreements with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2010, 2% of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 1,604 homes ($407.3 million) at November 30, 2010, compared to 1,631 homes ($479.6 million) at November 30, 2009. Non GAAP Financial Measures Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments are non GAAP financial measures, and are defined by us as sales of homes revenue less cost of homes sold excluding valuation adjustments recorded during the period and sales of homes revenue less cost of homes sold excluding valuation adjustments recorded during the period less selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Management finds these to be important and useful measures in evaluating our performance because it discloses the profit we generate on homes we actually delivered during the period, as our valuation adjustments generally relate to inventory that we did not deliver during the period. Gross margins as a percentage of revenue on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and operating margins as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments also are important to our management because they assist our management in making strategic decisions regarding our construction pace, product mix and product pricing based upon the profitability we generated on homes we actually delivered during previous periods. We believe investors also find gross margins and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments, and gross margins and operating margins on home sales as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments to be important and useful because each of them discloses a profitability measure on homes we actually delivered in a period that can be compared to the profitability on homes we delivered in a prior period without regard to the variability of valuation adjustments recorded from period to period. In addition, to the extent that our competitors provide similar information, disclosure of our gross margins and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and gross margins and operating margins on home sales as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments helps readers of our financial statements compare our ability to generate profits with regard to the homes we deliver in a period to our competitors ability to generate profits with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period. Although management finds gross margins and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and gross margins and operating margins on home sales as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments to be important measures in conducting and evaluating our operations, each of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by our company during the period. This is because they exclude charges we recorded relating to inventory that was impaired during the period. In addition, because gross margins and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and gross margins and operating margins as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), they may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded. Our management compensates for the limitations of using gross margins and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and gross and operating margins as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments by using these non GAAP measures only to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. In order to analyze our overall performance and actual profitability relative to our homebuilding operations, we also compare our gross margins and operating margins on home sales during the period and gross margins and operating margins as a percentage of revenues from home sales, inclusive of valuation adjustments, with the same measures during prior comparable periods. Due to the limitations discussed above, gross margins and operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and gross margins and operating margins as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments should not be viewed in isolation as they are not substitutes for GAAP measures of gross margins and operating margins. 27 Table of Contents The table set forth below reconciles our gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments and our operating margins as a percentage of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments for the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 to our gross margins and operating margins on home sales for the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Sales of homes $ 2,624,785 2,631,314 2,776,850 Cost of homes sold 2,101,414 2,113,393 2,524,850 Gross margins on home sales 523,371 517,921 252,000 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes 35,726 44,717 180,239 Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments $ 559,097 562,638 432,239 Selling, general and administrative expenses 384,798 376,962 449,259 Operating margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments $ 174,299 185,676 (17,020 ) Gross margin as a % of revenue from home sales excluding valuation adjustments 21.3 % 21.4 % 15.6 % Operating margin as a % of revenues from home sales excluding valuation adjustments 6.6 % 7.1 % (0.6 )% Homebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first time, move up and active adult homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations also purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and attempt to minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures. We have disaggregated our Homebuilding Southeast Florida division from our Homebuilding East reportable segment and have presented Homebuilding Southeast Florida as a separate reportable segment due to the division currently achieving one of the quantitative thresholds set forth in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, (ASC 280). In addition, we reclassified the homebuilding activities in the states of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina from Homebuilding Other to our Homebuilding East reportable segment because these states currently meet the reportable segment aggregation criteria in ASC 280. All prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the 2011 presentation. The change in reportable segments and Homebuilding Other had no effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented. As of and for the year ended November 30, 2011, we have grouped our homebuilding activities into five reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, Homebuilding West, Homebuilding Southeast Florida and Homebuilding Houston. Information about homebuilding activities in which our homebuilding activities are not economically similar to other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. Reference in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those reportable segments. At November 30, 2011, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in: East: Florida(1), Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas(2) West: California and Nevada Southeast Florida: Southeast Florida Houston: Houston, Texas Other: Illinois and Minnesota (1) Florida in the East reportable segment excludes Southeast Florida, which is its own reportable segment. (2) Texas in the Central reportable segment excludes Houston, Texas, which is its own reportable segment. 28 Table of Contents The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information related to our homebuilding operations for the years indicated: Selected Financial and Operational Data Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues: East: Sales of homes $ 1,009,750 970,355 906,979 Sales of land 11,062 16,623 23,509 Total East 1,020,812 986,978 930,488 Central: Sales of homes 355,350 348,486 361,273 Sales of land 9,907 9,246 5,910 Total Central 365,257 357,732 367,183 West: Sales of homes 531,984 650,844 810,459 Sales of land 8,879 32,646 15,778 Total West 540,863 683,490 826,237 Southeast Florida: Sales of homes 239,608 131,091 100,550 Sales of land 4,060 Total Southeast Florida 239,608 131,091 104,610 Houston: Sales of homes 321,908 357,590 429,127 Sales of land 19,802 8,348 5,691 Total Houston 341,710 365,938 434,818 Other Sales of homes 166,185 172,948 168,462 Sales of land 689 7,462 2,487 Total Other 166,874 180,410 170,949 Total homebuilding revenues $ 2,675,124 2,705,639 2,834,285 29 Table of Contents Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Operating earnings (loss): East: Sales of homes $ 98,822 114,061 (17,241 ) Sales of land 233 1,108 (67,675 ) Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (518 ) (602 ) (3,691 ) Other income (expense), net (1) 4,568 3,772 (7,846 ) Other interest expense (22,755 ) (19,113 ) (22,660 ) Total East 80,350 99,226 (119,113 ) Central: Sales of homes (2) (16,109 ) (7,910 ) (39,309 ) Sales of land 2,129 (353 ) 406 Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (922 ) (4,727 ) (8,143 ) Other expense, net (1,082 ) (2,261 ) (13,371 ) Other interest expense (15,184 ) (10,661 ) (10,223 ) Total Central (31,168 ) (25,912 ) (70,640 ) West: Sales of homes (2) (3,071 ) 4,019 (80,294 ) Sales of land 749 16,502 (48,125 ) Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (3) (57,215 ) (6,113 ) (114,373 ) Other income (expense), net (4) 117,066 5,451 (66,568 ) Other interest expense (31,479 ) (25,720 ) (21,710 ) Total West 26,050 (5,861 ) (331,070 ) Southeast Florida: Sales of homes 34,096 16,793 (51,514 ) Sales of land (25,293 ) Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (1,152 ) (269 ) (2,092 ) Other income (expense), net 2,488 9,460 (4,154 ) Other interest expense (8,004 ) (4,979 ) (4,001 ) Total Southeast Florida 27,428 21,005 (87,054 ) Houston: Sales of homes 16,115 25,138 25,854 Sales of land 4,617 1,683 (3,424 ) Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities 46 766 (1,801 ) Other income (expense), net 965 1,413 (900 ) Other interest expense (4,563 ) (2,970 ) (3,287 ) Total Houston 17,180 26,030 16,442 Other Sales of homes 8,720 (11,142 ) (34,755 ) Sales of land 2,417 (34,731 ) Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (2,955 ) (21 ) (817 ) Other income (expense), net (7,896 ) 1,300 (5,586 ) Other interest expense (8,665 ) (6,982 ) (8,969 ) Total Other (10,796 ) (14,428 ) (84,858 ) Total homebuilding operating earnings (loss) $ 109,044 $ 100,060 $ (676,293 ) (1) Other income (expense), net, for the year ended November 30, 2011 includes $5.1 million of income related to the favorable resolution of a joint venture.

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced cancellation rates in our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other as follows: Years EndedNovember 30, 2011 2010 2009 East 18 % 17 % 21 % Central 23 % 18 % 17 % West 18 % 18 % 15 % Southeast Florida 13 % 18 % 16 % Houston 21 % 18 % 19 % Other 8 % 11 % 16 % Total 19 % 17 % 18 % During the fourth quarter of 2011, our cancellation rate was 20%. Our cancellation rate during 2011 was within a range that is consistent with historical cancellation rates. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. 2011 versus 2010 East: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of the states in the segment, except New Jersey. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a higher percentage of home deliveries in higher priced communities. Gross margins on home sales were $230.2 million, or 22.8%, in 2011 including valuation adjustments of $5.6 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $236.0 million, or 24.3%, in 2010 including $6.2 million of valuation adjustments. Although gross margin percentage on home sales in this segment remained above average compared to the rest of our homebuilding operations, gross margin percentage on 33 Table of Contents home sales decreased compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales (12.8% in 2011, compared to 11.6% in 2010) and because gross margin on homes sales for the year ended November 30, 2010 included third party recoveries related to Chinese drywall. Central: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Texas, excluding Houston, as a result of the introduction of new higher end homes at a higher average sales price. Gross margins on home sales were $42.0 million, or 11.8%, in 2011 including valuation adjustments of $13.7 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $44.2 million, or 12.7%, in 2010 including $9.2 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to adjustments to pre existing home warranties in Texas, excluding Houston and an increase in valuation adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales (12.8% in 2011, compared to 13.2% in 2010). West: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries and the averages sales price of homes delivered in California. The decrease in the number of home deliveries in California resulted from a decrease in demand for new homes primarily driven by the absence of the Federal homebuyer tax credit during the entire year in 2011. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in California was due to shift to smaller square footage homes generating a lower average sales price during the year ended November 30, 2011. Gross margins on home sales were $105.1 million, or 19.7%, in 2011 including valuation adjustments of $7.8 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $125.5 million, or 19.3%, in 2010 including $7.1 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year primarily due to an $8.1 million benefit related to changes in our cost to complete estimates for homebuilding communities in the close out phase, partially offset by a higher percentage of home deliveries in lower price point communities and reduced pricing as the segment focused on reducing its completed unsold inventory. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales were (9.2% in both 2011 and 2010). Gross profit on land sales were $0.7 million in 2011, compared to gross profits on land sales of $16.5 million in 2010, primarily due to a $14.1 million reduction of an obligation related to a profit participation agreement in 2010. Southeast Florida: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in this segment as a result of home deliveries from communities acquired in prior year that had sales, but only a few deliveries, during the year ended November 30, 2010. Southeast Florida also had an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered as a result of closing out lower price point communities in the beginning of 2011 and introducing new communities at a higher price point during the year. Gross margins on home sales were $57.5 million, or 24.0%, in 2011 including valuation adjustments of $5.6 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $32.5 million, or 24.8%, in 2010 including $4.4 million of valuation adjustments. Although gross margin percentage on home sales in this segment remained above average compared to the rest of our homebuilding operations, gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to prior year primarily due to increased valuation adjustments in 2011 and because gross margin on homes sales for the year ended November 30, 2010 included third party recoveries related to Chinese drywall. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales (12.0% in 2011, compare to 14.5% in 2010) Houston: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries resulting from a decrease in demand for new homes primarily driven by the absence of the Federal homebuyer tax credit during the entire year in 2011, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered as a result of the close out of lower average sales priced communities in 2010. Gross margins on home sales were $58.9 million, or 18.3%, in 2011, compared to gross margins on home sales of $68.1 million, or 19.0%, in 2010. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to last year primarily due to reduced pricing in some lower price point communities in an effort to reduce its completed unsold inventory, partially offset by a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales (14.5% in 2011, compared to 15.0% in 2010). Gross profits on land sales were $4.6 million in 2011, compared to profits on land sales of $1.7 million in 2010. Other: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in Illinois primarily driven by the absence of the Federal homebuyer tax credit during the entire year in 2011. Gross margins on home sales were $29.7 million, or 17.9%, in 2011 including valuation adjustments of $2.5 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $11.6 million, or 6.7%, in 2010 including $17.5 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margin percentage on home sales improved compared to last year primarily due to a reduction of valuation adjustments and a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales (10.5% in 2011, compared to 12.3% in 2010). There was no gross profit on land sales in 2011, compared to profits on land sales of $2.4 million in 2010. 2010 versus 2009 East: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment, except New Jersey, resulting primarily from an increase in the number of active communities in Florida, excluding Southeast Florida. Gross margins on home sales were $236.0 million, or 24.3%, in 2010 including valuation adjustments of $6.2 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of $100.5 million, or 11.1%, in 2009 34 Table of Contents including $43.4 million of valuation adjustments. Gross margins on home sales excluding valuation adjustments were $242.3 million, or 25.0%, in 2010, compared to $143.9 million, or 15.9%, in 2009. In 2010, gross margin percentage on home sales, excluding valuation adjustments, improved compared to 2009 primarily due third party recoveries related to Chinese drywall and reduced sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales (11.6% in 2010, compared to 16.8% in 2009). Gross profits on land sales were $1.1 million in 2010 (net of $2.7 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $0.1 million of valuation adjustments), compared to losses on land sales of $67.7 million in 2009 (including $61.3 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $14.6 million of valuation adjustments). Central: Homebuilding revenues decreased in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in this segment, except Colorado, resulting primarily from the expiration of the Federal homebuyer tax credit at the end of April 2010.

Gross profits on land sales were $16.5 million in 2010, primarily due to a $14.1 million reduction of an obligation related to a profit participation agreement. Losses on land sales were $48.1 million in 2009 (including $13.9 million of write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land under option that we do not intend to purchase and $38.7 million of valuation adjustments). Southeast Florida: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and averages sales price of homes delivered in this segment, primarily as a result of an increase in active communities. Gross margins on home sales were $32.5 million, or 24.8%, in 2010 including valuation adjustments of $4.4 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of ($38.4) million, or (38.2%), in 2009 including $31.1 million of valuation adjustments.

Other: Homebuilding revenues increased in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all of the states in Homebuilding Other except Illinois. The increase in the number of home deliveries resulted from new communities in certain of the states in this segment. Gross margins on home sales were $11.6 million, or 6.7%, in 2010 including valuation adjustments of $17.5 million, compared to gross margins on home sales of ($7.5) million, or (4.4%), in 2009 including $27.0 million of valuation adjustments.

Substantially all of the loans the Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to the Lennar Financial Services segment: Years Ended November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 255,518 275,786 285,102 Costs and expenses 234,789 244,502 249,120 Operating earnings $ 20,729 31,284 35,982 Dollar value of mortgages originated $ 2,896,000 3,272,000 4,020,000 Number of mortgages originated 13,800 15,200 17,900 Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers 78 % 85 % 87 % Number of title and closing service transactions 86,400 102,500 120,500 Number of title policies issued 121,800 107,600 92,500 Rialto Investments Segment Rialtos objective is to generate superior, risk adjusted returns by focusing on commercial and residential real estate opportunities arising from dislocations in the United States real estate markets and the eventual restructure and recapitalization of those markets. Rialto believes it will be able to deliver these returns through its abilities to source, underwrite, price, manage and ultimately monetize real estate assets, as well as providing similar services to others in markets across the country. The following table presents the results of operations of our Rialto segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 164,743 92,597 Costs and expenses 132,583 67,904 2,528 Rialto Investments equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities (7,914 ) 15,363 Rialto Investments other income, net 39,211 17,251 Operating earnings (loss) (1) $ 63,457 57,307 (2,528 ) (1) Operating earnings (loss) for the year ended November 30, 2011 and 2010 include $28.9 million and $33.2 million, respectively, of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Distressed Asset Portfolios In February 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies (LLCs), in partnership with the FDIC, for approximately $243 million (net of transactions costs and a $22 million working capital reserve). The LLCs hold performing and non performing loans formerly owned by 22 failed financial institutions. The two portfolios originally consisted of more than 5,500 distressed residential and commercial real estate loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $3 billion and an initial fair value of approximately $1.2 billion. The FDIC retained a 60% equity interest in the LLCs and provided $626.9 million of notes with 0% interest, which are non recourse to us. In accordance with GAAP, interest has not been imputed because the notes are with, and guaranteed by, a governmental agency. The notes are secured by the loans held by the LLCs. Additionally, if the LLCs exceed expectations and meet certain internal rate of return and distribution thresholds, our equity interest in the LLCs could be reduced from 40% down to 30%, with a corresponding increase to the FDICs equity interest from 60% up to 70%. Although our equity interest could decrease, we believe we would most likely yield a higher return on our investment if the thresholds are met. As of both November 30, 2011 and 2010, the notes payable balance was $626.9 million; however, as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, $219.4 million and $101.3 million, respectively, of cash collections on loans in excess of expenses were deposited in a defeasance account, established for the repayment of the notes payable, under the agreement with the FDIC. The funds in the defeasance account will be used to retire the notes payable upon their maturity. 37 Table of Contents The LLCs met the accounting definition of variable interest entities (VIEs) and since we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, we consolidated the LLCs. We determined that we were the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact the LLCs performance through our management and servicer contracts. At November 30, 2011, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of $1.4 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. In September 2010, the Rialto segment acquired approximately 400 distressed residential and commercial real estate loans and over 300 REO properties from three financial institutions. We paid $310 million for the distressed real estate assets of which, $124 million was financed through a 5 year senior unsecured note provided by one of the selling institutions. The loans consisted primarily of non performing residential and commercial acquisition development and construction loans. The largest concentration of collateral for these loans was finished/partially finished homesites, undeveloped land and completed/partially completed homes. The real estate properties primarily consisted of land, homesites, and single family and multi family residential communities at varying stages of completion. In the combined portfolio, 65% of the assets were residential and 35% were commercial. The acquired assets were located in 17 states, primarily in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast regions of the United States with the largest concentration of assets in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Investments An affiliate in the Rialto segment is a sub advisor to the AB PPIP fund and receives management fees for sub advisory services. We also made a commitment to invest $75 million in the AB PPIP fund, of which the remaining commitment as of November 30, 2011 was $7.5 million. During the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010, we invested $3.7 million and $63.8 million, respectively, in the AB PPIP fund. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our investment in the AB PPIP fund was $65.2 million and $77.3 million, respectively. In November 2010, the Rialto segment completed the first closing of its Fund with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by us). The Funds objective during its three year investment period is to invest in distressed real estate assets and other related investments that fit within the Funds investment parameters. During the year ended November 30, 2011, we contributed $60.6 million of which $13.4 million was distributed back to us as a return of excess capital contributions as a result of new investors in the Fund. Total investor contributions to the Fund for the year ended November 30, 2011 were $387.8 million. During the year ended November 30, 2011, the Fund acquired distressed real estate asset portfolios and invested in commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) at a discount to par value. As of November 30, 2011, the carrying value of our investment in the Fund was $50.1 million. As of November 30, 2011, the equity commitments of the Fund were $700 million (including the $75 million committed by us). Since the Funds inception, our share of earnings as of November 30, 2011 was $2.9 million. In addition, during the year ended November 30, 2010, the Rialto segment also invested in approximately $43 million of non investment grade CMBS for $19.4 million, representing a 55% discount to par value. During the year ended November 30, 2011, the Rialto segment sold a portion of its CMBS for $11.1 million, resulting in a gain on sale of CMBS of $4.7 million. The carrying value of the investment securities as of November 30, 2011 and 2010 was $14.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively. Additionally, another subsidiary in the Rialto segment also has approximately a 5% investment in a service and infrastructure provider to the residential home loan market (the Service Provider), which provides services to the consolidated LLCs, among others. At November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our investment in the Servicer Provider was $8.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively. Financial Condition and Capital Resources At November 30, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents related to our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto operations of $1.2 billion, compared to $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, at November 30, 2010 and 2009. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Rialto activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and equity offerings, as well as cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit. 38 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flow Activities During 2011 and 2010, cash (used in) provided by operating activities totaled ($259.1) million and $274.2 million, respectively. During 2011, cash used in operating activities were impacted by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities, an increase in inventories due to strategic land purchases, an increase in receivables, an increase in other assets and an increase in Lennar Financial Services loans held for sale, partially offset by our net earnings. During 2010, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by the receipt of tax refunds of $343.0 million generated primarily from losses incurred prior to fiscal 2010 and our net earnings. This was partially offset by a net increase in inventories of $115.2 million, primarily due to a higher level of land purchases in strategic markets during the year ended November 30, 2010 and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities. Investing Cash Flow Activities During 2011 and 2010, cash used in investing activities totaled $136.2 million and $673.4 million, respectively. During 2011, we received $74.9 million of principal payments on Rialto Investments loans receivable, $91.0 million of proceeds from the sale of REO and $31.1 million of distributions of capital from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. This was offset by $98.5 million of cash contributions to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities primarily for working capital and debt reduction, $64.4 million of cash contributions to Rialto Investments unconsolidated entities, $118.1 million increase in Rialto Investments defeasance cash and $53.6 million to purchase held to maturity investment securities that mature at various dates within one year by Lennar Financial Services. During the year ended November 30, 2010, our Rialto segment contributed $243 million of cash (net of a $22 million working capital reserve) to acquire indirectly 40% managing member interests in two LLCs in partnership with the FDIC. Upon consolidation of the LLCs that hold the two portfolios of real estate loans acquired in the FDIC transaction, we consolidated $93.7 million of cash, resulting in net contributions to consolidated entities by the Rialto segment of $171.4 million during the year ended November 30, 2010. In addition, during 2010 cash collections of $101.3 million on loans in excess of expenses were deposited in a defeasance account established for the repayment of the notes payable under the agreement with the FDIC. In September 2010, our Rialto segment used $183.4 million of cash to acquire portfolios of distressed loans and real estate assets, in separate transactions, from three financial institutions. The Rialto segment also contributed $64.3 million of cash to unconsolidated entities related primarily to the AB PPIP fund. Additionally, during 2010 we contributed $209.3 million of cash to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities of which $113.5 million was to retire and extend debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities thereby decreasing leverage at the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities and $95.8 million was for working capital. Specifically, we contributed $69.6 million to one Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity of which $50.3 million was a loan paydown, representing both our and our partners share, in return for a 4 year loan extension and the rights to obtain preferred returns and priority distributions at that unconsolidated entity. We also made a $19.3 million payment to extinguish debt at a discount and buy out the partner of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity resulting in a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million. We are always evaluating the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies. However, at November 30, 2011, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions. Financing Cash Flow Activities During 2011, our cash provided by financing activities of $164.8 million was primarily attributed to the issuance of new debt, partially offset by principal payments on other borrowings and the repayment of our 5.95% senior notes due 2011. During 2010, our cash provided by financing activities of $335.8 million was primarily attributable to the redemption of senior notes and principal payments on other borrowings, offset by the issuance of new debt. During 2011 and 2010, we exercised certain land option contracts from a land investment venture that we sold land to in 2007, reducing the liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet related to consolidated inventory not owned by $41.0 million and $39.3 million, respectively. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory remained on our balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned. 39 Table of Contents Debt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our Lennar Homebuilding operations. Management believes providing a measure of leverage of our Lennar Homebuilding operations enables management and readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance. Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital are calculated as follows: November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Lennar Homebuilding debt $ 3,362,759 3,128,154 Stockholders equity 2,696,468 2,608,949 Total capital $ 6,059,227 5,737,103 Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital 55.5 % 54.5 % Lennar Homebuilding debt $ 3,362,759 3,128,154 Less: Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents 1,024,212 1,207,247 Net Lennar Homebuilding debt $ 2,338,547 1,920,907 Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital (1) 46.4 % 42.4 % (1) Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus total stockholders equity). At November 30, 2011, net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital was higher compared to prior year, due to the increase in Lennar Homebuilding debt as a result of an increase in senior notes and a decrease in Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in stockholders equity primarily related to our net earnings. In addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto operations, we actively evaluate various other uses of capital, which fit into our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals. This may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our warehouse lines of credit, cash generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance into capital markets of debt, common stock or preferred stock. The following table summarizes our Lennar Homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 5.95% senior notes due 2013 $ 266,855 266,319 5.50% senior notes due 2014 248,967 248,657 5.60% senior notes due 2015 500,999 501,216 6.50% senior notes due 2016 249,819 249,788 12.25% senior notes due 2017 393,700 393,031 6.95% senior notes due 2018 247,598 247,323 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 276,500 276,500 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 388,417 375,875 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 350,000 5.95% senior notes due 2011 113,189 Mortgages notes on land and other debt 439,904 456,256 $ 3,362,759 3,128,154 Our Lennar Homebuilding average debt outstanding was $3.1 billion in 2011, compared to $2.8 billion in 2010. The average rate for interest incurred was 5.7% and 6.1%, respectively in 2011 and 2010. Interest incurred related to Lennar Homebuilding debt for the year ended November 30, 2011 was $201.4 million, compared to $181.5 million in 2010. The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations and proceeds of debt issuances. In November 2011, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2021, at a price of 100% in a private placement. Subsequent to November 30, 2011, the initial purchasers of the 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 purchased an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 to cover over allotments. The total aggregate principal amount of the 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (3.25% Convertible Senior Notes) is $400.0 million. As of November 30, 2011, proceeds from the offering, after payment of expenses, were $342.6 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2011, we received the proceeds from the over allotments of $49.0 million, after payment of 40 Table of Contents expenses. The net proceeds have been or will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayments or repurchases of existing senior notes or other indebtedness, acquisitions of land suitable for residential development and purchases of, or investments in portfolios of, distressed real estate assets and foreclosed real estate assets. The 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at any time prior to maturity or redemption at the initial conversion rate of 42.5555 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes or 17,022,200 Class A common shares if all the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes are converted, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.50 per share of Class A common stock, subject to anti dilution adjustments. The shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Holders of the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes have the right to require us to repurchase them for cash equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest on November 15, 2016. We have the right to redeem the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes at any time on or after November 20, 2016 for 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Interest on the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes is due semi annually beginning May 15, 2012. The 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. At November 30, 2011, the carrying amount of the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes was $350.0 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2011, the carrying amount of the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes was increased to $400.0 million. In November 2010, we issued $446.0 million of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes) at a price of 100% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of expenses, were $436.4 million. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayments or repurchases of existing senior notes or other indebtedness. The 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of both, at our election. However, it is our intent to settle the face value of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes in cash. Holders may convert the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes at the initial conversion rate of 45.1794 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount or 20,150,012 Class A common shares if all the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes are converted, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.13 per share of Class A common stock, subject to anti dilution adjustments. The shares are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share primarily because it is our intent to settle the face value of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes in cash and our stock price does not exceed the conversion price. Holders of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes have the right to convert them, during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day. Holders of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes have the right to require us to repurchase them for cash equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, on December 15, 2015. We have the right to redeem the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes at any time on or after December 20, 2015 for 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Interest on the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes is due semi annually beginning June 15, 2011. The 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. For our 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes, we will be required to pay contingent interest with regard to any interest period beginning with the interest period commencing December 20, 2015 and ending June 14, 2016, and for each subsequent six month period commencing on an interest payment date to, but excluding, the next interest payment date, if the average trading price of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes. The amount of contingent interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of notes during the applicable interest period will equal 0.75% per year of the average trading price of such $1,000 principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes during the five trading day reference period. Certain provisions under ASC Topic 470, Debt, require the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non convertible debt borrowing rate. We have applied these provisions to our 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes. We estimated the fair value of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes using similar debt instruments at issuance that did not have a conversion feature and allocated the residual value to an equity component that represents the estimated fair value of the conversion feature at issuance. The debt discount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes is being amortized over five years and the annual effective interest rate is 7.1% after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs. At both November 30, 2011 and 2010, the principal amount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes was $446.0 million. At November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount of the equity component included in stockholders equity was $57.6 million and $70.1 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes included in Lennar Homebuilding Senior Notes and other notes payable was $388.4 million and $375.9 million, respectively. During the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010, the amount of interest recognized relating to both the contractual interest and amortization of the discount was $24.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively. In May 2010, we issued $250 million of 6.95% senior notes due 2018 (the 6.95% Senior Notes) at a price of 98.929% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $243.9 million. We 41 Table of Contents used the net proceeds of the sale of the 6.95% Senior Notes to fund purchases pursuant to our tender offer for our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010, our 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and our 5.95% senior notes due 2013. Interest on the 6.95% Senior Notes is due semi annually. The 6.95% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. Subsequently, most of the privately placed 6.95% Senior Notes were exchanged for substantially identical 6.95% senior notes that had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. At November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount of the 6.95% Senior Notes was $247.6 million and $247.3 million, respectively. In May 2010, we issued $276.5 million of 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes) at a price of 100% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of expenses, were $271.2 million. The net proceeds were to be used for general corporate purposes, including repayments or repurchases of existing senior notes or other indebtedness. The 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at the initial conversion rate of 36.1827 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes or 10,004,517 Class A common shares if all the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes are converted, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $27.64 per share of Class A common stock, subject to anti dilution adjustments. The shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Holders of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes have the right to require us to repurchase them for cash equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, on each of December 1, 2013 and December 1, 2015. We have the right to redeem the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes at any time on or after December 1, 2013 for 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest. Interest on the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes is due semi annually. The 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. At both November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes was $276.5 million. For our 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes, we will be required to pay contingent interest with regard to any interest period commencing with the six month interest period beginning December 1, 2013, if the average trading price of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes. The amount of contingent interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of notes during the applicable six month interest period will equal 0.50% per year of the average trading price of such $1,000 principal amount of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes during the five trading day reference period. In May 2010, we repurchased $289.4 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due 2010, 2011 and 2013 through a tender offer, resulting in a pre tax loss of $10.8 million. Through the tender offer, we repurchased $76.4 million principal amount of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010, $130.8 million principal amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2011 and $82.3 million principal amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2013. During the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, we redeemed $150.8 million (including amount redeemed through the tender offer) and $50.0 million, respectively, of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010. In October 2010, we retired the remaining $99.2 million of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2010 for 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the maturity date. During the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, we redeemed $131.8 million (including amount redeemed through the tender offer) and $5.0 million, respectively, of our 5.95% senior notes due 2011. In October 2011, we retired the remaining $113.2 million of our 5.125% senior notes due October 2011 for 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the maturity date. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we redeemed $82.3 million (including the amount redeemed through the tender offer) of our 5.95% senior notes due 2013. At November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount of our 5.95% senior notes due 2013 was $266.9 million and $266.3 million, respectively. Currently, substantially all of our wholly owned homebuilding subsidiaries are guaranteeing all our Senior Notes (the Guaranteed Notes). The guarantees are full and unconditional. The principal reason our wholly owned homebuilding subsidiaries guaranteed the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect only while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Therefore, if the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under its letter of credit facility and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes. 42 Table of Contents If our guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing a revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million. In 2010, we entered into cash collateralized letter of credit agreements with two banks with a capacity totaling $225 million. In November 2010, we terminated our cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and simultaneously entered into a $150 million Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (LC Agreement) with certain financial institutions. The LC Agreement may be increased to $200 million, although there are currently no commitments for the additional $50 million. In addition, in October 2011, we entered into a $50 million Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement with certain financial institutions that has a $50 million accordion for which there are currently no commitments. We also have a $200 million Letter of Credit Facility with a financial institution. We believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants at November 30, 2011. Our performance letters of credit outstanding were $68.0 million and $78.9 million, respectively, at November 30, 2011 and 2010. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were $199.3 million and $195.0 million, respectively, at November 30, 2011 and 2010. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, and financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. At November 30, 2011, our Lennar Financial Services segment had a 364 day warehouse repurchase facility with a maximum aggregate commitment of $150 million and an additional uncommitted amount of $73 million that matures in February 2012, and another 364 day warehouse repurchase facility with a maximum aggregate commitment of $175 million (plus a $25 million temporary accordion feature that expired December 31, 2011) that matures in July 2012. As of November 30, 2011, the maximum aggregate commitment and uncommitted amount under these facilities totaled $350 million and $73 million, respectively. Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and expects the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. Borrowings under the facilities were $410.1 million and $271.6 million, respectively, at November 30, 2011 and 2010, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold to investors but not yet paid for with outstanding principal balances of $431.6 million and $286.0 million, respectively, at November 30, 2011 and 2010. These facilities have several interest rate pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The combined effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2011 was 3.4%. Since our Lennar Financial Services segments borrowings under the warehouse repurchase facilities are generally repaid with the proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and receivables on loans that secure those borrowings, the facilities are not likely to be a call on our current cash or future cash resources. If the facilities are not renewed, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be paid off by selling the mortgage loans held for sale and by collecting on receivables on loans sold but not yet paid. Without the facilities, our Lennar Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities. Our Lennar Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Our Lennar Financial Services segment enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance. Changes in Capital Structure We have a stock repurchase program which permits the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no share repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. As of November 30, 2011, 6.2 million shares of common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program. During the years ended November 30, 2011 and November 30, 2010, treasury stock increased by 0.3 million Class A common shares and 0.1 million Class A common shares, respectively, due to activity related to our equity compensation plan and forfeitures of restricted stock. In April 2009, we entered into distribution agreements with J.P Morgan Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merril Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., relating to an offering of our Class A common stock into the market from time to time for an aggregate of up to $275 million. As of November 30, 2009, we had sold a total of 21.0 million shares of our Class A common stock under the equity offering for gross proceeds of $225.5 million, or an average of $10.76 per share. After compensation to the distributors of $4.5 million, we received net proceeds of $221.0 million. We used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. There was no activity related to these distribution agreements during both the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010. 43 Table of Contents During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Class A and Class B common stockholders received a per share annual dividend of $0.16. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities At November 30, 2011, we had equity investments in 35 unconsolidated entities (of which 10 had recourse debt, 8 had non recourse debt and 17 had no debt), compared to 42 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2010 and 270 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2006. Historically, we invested in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Through these entities, we primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners. Although the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures partners vary, the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire, develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time. The joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. Additionally, most joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment or maintenance guarantees generally is required. Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of joint ventures earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyer. In some instances, we are designated as the manager under the direction of a management committee that has shared power amongst the partners of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts generally require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits are generally negotiated by management on a case by case basis. We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. Joint ventures in which we have investments are subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business. As discussed above, the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities. In some instances, the debt financing is non recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guarantees. 44 Table of Contents Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the joint venture participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other joint venture participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes. The joint ventures often enter into option agreements with buyers, which may include us or other joint venture participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements. As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint ventures activities and the stage in the joint ventures life cycle. We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our joint ventures. For purposes of classifying distributions received from joint ventures in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities. Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows: Statement of Operations and Selected Information Years Ended November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 301,843 236,752 339,993 Costs and expenses 451,272 378,997 1,212,866 Other income 123,007 Net loss of unconsolidated entities (1) $ (26,422 ) (142,245 ) (872,873 ) Our share of net loss $ (41,275 ) (13,301 ) (131,138 ) Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (2) $ (62,716 ) (10,966 ) (130,917 ) Our cumulative share of net earnings deferred at November 30 $ 3,362 8,689 12,052 Our investments in unconsolidated entities $ 545,760 626,185 599,266 Equity of the unconsolidated entities $ 2,055,966 2,148,610 2,248,289 Our investment % in the unconsolidated entities 27 % 29 % 27 % (1) The net loss of unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009 was primarily related to valuation adjustments and operating losses recorded by the unconsolidated entities. Our exposure to such losses was significantly lower as a result of its small ownership interests in the respective unconsolidated entities or its previous valuation adjustments recorded to its investments in Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities. (2) For the year ended November 30, 2011, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss includes a $57.6 million valuation adjustment related to an asset distribution from a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity that resulted from a linked transaction where there was also a pre tax gain of $62.3 million, included in Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net, related to the distribution of assets of the unconsolidated entity. In addition, for the year ended November 30, 2011, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities includes $8.9 million of valuation adjustments related to the assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, offset by a $15.4 million gain related to our share of a $123.0 million gain on debt extinguishment at a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated 45 Table of Contents entity. For the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million from a transaction related to one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities. In addition, for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities includes $10.5 million and $101.9 million, respectively, of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.

As of November 30, 2010, our recorded investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities were $626.2 million while the underlying equity in the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities net assets was $666.0 million, primarily as a result of us buying out at a discount the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities partners equity. In 2007, we sold a portfolio of land to a strategic land investment venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., in which we have a 20% ownership interest and 50% voting rights. Due to our continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale under GAAP; thus, the inventory has remained on our consolidated balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the portfolio of land (including land development costs) of $372.0 million and $424.5 million, respectively, is reflected as inventory in the summarized condensed financial information related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities. In June 2008, LandSource Communities Development LLC (LandSource), in which we had a 16% ownership interest, and a number of its subsidiaries commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In July 2009, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the plan of reorganization for LandSource. As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, LandSource was reorganized into a new company called Newhall Land Development, LLC, (Newhall). The reorganized company emerged from Chapter 11 free of its previous bank debt. As part of the reorganization plan, in 2009, we invested $140 million in exchange for approximately a 15% equity interest in the reorganized Newhall, ownership in several communities that were formerly owned by LandSource, the settlement and release of all claims that might have been asserted against us and certain other claims LandSource had against third parties. Debt to total capital of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was calculated as follows: November 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Debt $ 960,627 1,284,818 Equity 2,055,966 2,148,610 Total capital $ 3,016,593 3,433,428 Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities 31.8 % 37.4 % 46 Table of Contents Our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows: November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Land development $ 461,077 530,004 Homebuilding 84,683 96,181 Total investments $ 545,760 626,185 We recorded $10.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities for the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010. We will continue to monitor our investments in joint ventures and the recoverability of assets owned by those joint ventures. The summary of our net recourse exposure related to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was as follows: November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Several recourse debt repayment $ 62,408 33,399 Several recourse debt maintenance 29,454 Joint and several recourse debt repayment 46,292 48,406 Joint and several recourse debt maintenance 61,591 Lennars maximum recourse exposure 108,700 172,850 Less: joint and several reimbursement agreements with our partners (33,795 ) (58,878 ) Lennars net recourse exposure $ 74,905 113,972 During the year ended November 30, 2011, our maximum recourse exposure related to indebtedness of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities decreased by $100.4 million as a result of $17.9 million paid by us primarily through capital contributions to unconsolidated entities, a $43.5 million debt reduction as a result of a transaction in which we received a net asset distribution from Platinum Triangle Partners, one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities, and $39.0 million primarily related to the restructuring of a guarantee, the consolidation of a joint venture in 2011 and the joint ventures selling inventory. The decrease in our maximum recourse exposure was partially offset by a $36.3 million increase in the maximum recourse exposure for consideration given in the form of a several repayment guarantee in connection with the favorable debt maturity extension until 2018 and principal reduction at Heritage Fields El Toro, one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities as discussed in the note to the following table. As of November 30, 2011, we had no obligation guarantees accrued. At November 30, 2010, we had $10.2 million of obligation guarantees accrued as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended November 30, 2011, the liability was reduced by $10.2 million, of which $7.6 million were cash payments related to obligation guarantees previously recorded and $2.6 million related to a change in estimate of an obligation guarantee. The obligation guarantees are estimated based on current facts and circumstances and any unexpected changes may lead us to incur additional liabilities under our obligation guarantees in the future. Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. Some Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities own multiple properties and other assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt to different unconsolidated entities. We also do not use our investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt in another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. In connection with loans to a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any, or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of an unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee). In connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity where there is a joint and several guarantee, we generally have a reimbursement agreement with our partner. The reimbursement agreement provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee. However, if our joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. 47 Table of Contents The recourse debt exposure in the previous table represents our maximum exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are available to repay debt or to reimburse us for any payments on our guarantees. The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities that have recourse debt have a significant amount of assets and equity. The summarized balance sheets of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities with recourse debt were as follows. November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Assets (1) $ 1,865,144 990,028 Liabilities (1) $ 815,815 487,606 Equity (1) $ 1,049,329 502,422 (1) In 2011, Heritage Fields El Toro, one of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities, extended the maturity of its $573.5 million debt until 2018, which at the time was without recourse to Lennar. In exchange for the extension and partial debt extinguishment, which reduced the outstanding debt balance to $481.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, all the partners agreed to provide a limited several repayment guarantee on the outstanding debt, which resulted in a $36.3 million increase to our maximum recourse exposure and a subsequent increase to assets, liabilities and equity of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities that have recourse debt. In addition, we recognized a $15.4 million gain for our share of the $123.0 million gain on debt extinguishment, including a reduction in the accrued interest payable, in 2011. In addition, in most instances in which we have guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, our partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payment. Some of our guarantees are repayment guarantees and some are maintenance guarantees. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. In the event of default, if our venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum recourse exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would generally constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes. In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, we and our joint venture partners (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used. During the year ended November 30, 2011, there were: (1) payments of $1.7 million under our maintenance guarantees, and (2) other loan paydowns of $16.3 million, a portion of which related to amounts paid under our repayment guarantees. During the year ended November 30, 2010, there were: (1) payments of $10.0 million under our maintenance guarantees, (2) at our election, a loan paydown of $50.3 million, representing both our and our partners share, in return for 4 year loan extension and the rights to obtain preferred returns and priority distributions at one of our unconsolidated entities, and (3) a $19.3 million payment to extinguish debt at a discount and buy out the partner of one of our unconsolidated entities resulting in a net pre tax gain of $7.7 million. In addition, during the year ended November 30, 2010, there were other loan paydowns of $28.1 million, a portion of which related to amounts paid under our repayment guarantees. During the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010, there were no payments under completion guarantees. As of November 30, 2011, the fair values of the maintenance guarantees, repayment guarantees and completion guarantees were not material. We believe that as of November 30, 2011, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, most of the time the collateral should be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. 48 Table of Contents The total debt of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was as follows: November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Lennars net recourse exposure $ 74,905 113,972 Reimbursement agreements from partners 33,795 58,878 Lennars maximum recourse exposure $ 108,700 172,850 Non recourse bank debt and other debt (partners share of several recourse) $ 149,937 79,921 Non recourse land seller debt or other debt 26,391 58,604 Non recourse debt with completion guarantees 441,770 600,297 Non recourse debt without completion guarantees 233,829 373,146 Non recourse debt to Lennar 851,927 1,111,968 Total debt $ 960,627 1,284,818 Lennars maximum recourse exposure as a % of total JV debt 11 % 13 % In view of current credit market conditions, it is not uncommon for lenders to real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, to assert non monetary defaults (such as failure to meet construction completion deadlines or declines in the market value of collateral below required amounts) or technical monetary defaults against the real estate developers. In most instances, those asserted defaults are resolved by modifications of the loan terms, additional equity investments or other concessions by the borrowers. In addition, in some instances, real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are forced to request temporary waivers of covenants in loan documents or modifications of loan terms, which are often, but not always obtained. However, in some instances developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are not able to meet their monetary obligations to lenders, and are thus declared in default. Because we sometimes guarantee all or portions of the obligations to lenders of joint ventures in which we have interests, when these joint ventures default on their obligations, lenders may or may not have claims against us. Normally, we do not make payments with regard to guarantees of joint venture obligations while the joint ventures are contesting assertions regarding sums due to their lenders. When it is determined that a joint venture is obligated to make a payment that we have guaranteed and the joint venture will not be able to make that payment, we accrue the amounts probable to be paid by us as a liability. Although we generally fulfill our guarantee obligations within a reasonable time after we determine that we are obligated with regard to them, at any point in time it is likely that we will have some balance of unpaid guarantee liability. At November 30, 2011, we had no liabilities accrued for unpaid guarantees of joint venture indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet. At November 30, 2010, the liability for unpaid guarantees of joint venture indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $10.2 million. The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities (JVs) debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2011 and does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. Many JV loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.

The PPIP matches private capital with public capital and financing provided by the U.S. Treasury, which provides an opportunity for private investors to invest in certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities and CMBS issued prior to 2009 that were originally rated AAA, or an equivalent rating, by two or more nationally recognized statistical organizations without ratings enhancements. These securities are backed directly by actual mortgage loans and not by other securities. We committed to invest $75 million in a PPIP fund managed by AB. An affiliate of Rialto is a sub advisor to the AB PPIP fund and receives management fees for sub advisory services. Total equity commitments of approximately $1.2 billion were made by private investors in this fund, and the U.S. Treasury has committed to a matching amount of approximately $1.2 billion of equity in the fund, as well as agreed to extend up to approximately $2.3 billion of debt financing. As of November 30, 2011, 90% of committed capital has been called including our portion, $67.5 million of the $75 million we committed to invest. As of November 30, 2011, the AB PPIP has invested approximately $4.4 billion to purchase $6.9 billion in face amount of non agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities and it is reflected in investments in the summarized condensed balance sheets of Rialtos unconsolidated entities. The gross yield of the fund since its inception has totaled approximately 22%. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our investment in the AB PPIP fund was $65.2 million and $77.3 million, respectively. In November 2010, our Rialto segment completed the first closing of the Fund with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by us). The Funds objective during its three year investment period is to invest in distressed real estate assets and other related investments that fit within the Funds investment parameters. During the year ended November 30, 2011, we contributed $60.6 million of which $13.4 million was distributed back to us as a return of excess capital contributions as a result of new investors in the Fund. Total investor contributions to the Fund for the year ended November 30, 2011 were $387.8 million. During the year ended November 30, 2011, the Fund acquired distressed real estate asset portfolios and invested in CMBS at a discount to par value. As of November 30, 2011, the carrying value of our investment in the Fund was $50.1 million. As of November 30, 2011, the equity commitments of the Fund were $700 million (including the $75 million committed by us). Since the Funds inception, our share of earnings as of November 30, 2011 was $2.9 million. Additionally, another subsidiary in our Rialto segment has approximately a 5% investment in the Service Provider, which provides services to the consolidated LLCs, among others. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our investment in the Servicer Provider was $8.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively. Summarized condensed financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Rialtos investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows: Balance Sheets November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 60,936 42,793 Loans receivable 274,213 Real estate owned 47,204 Investment securities 4,336,418 4,341,226 Other assets 171,196 181,600 $ 4,889,967 4,565,619 Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities $ 320,353 110,921 Notes payable 40,877 Partner loans 137,820 137,820 Debt due to the U.S. Treasury 2,044,950 1,955,000 Equity 2,345,967 2,361,878 $ 4,889,967 4,565,619 52 Table of Contents Statements of Operations Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 470,282 357,330 58,464 Costs and expenses 183,326 209,103 89,570 Other income (expense), net (1) (614,014 ) 311,468 Net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities (2) $ (327,058 ) 459,695 (31,106 ) Rialto Investments equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities $ (7,914 ) 15,363 (1) Other income (expense), net for the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010 includes the AB PPIP Funds mark to market unrealized gains and losses, of which our portion is a small percentage. (2) Amounts included for the year ended November 30, 2009 relate only to the Service Provider because we did not invest in the AB PPIP fund until December 2009. Option Contracts We have access to land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. Until recently, these option deposits generally have approximated 10% of the exercise price. Our option contracts sometimes include price adjustment provisions, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at the time of acquisition or are based on fair value at the time of takedown. The exercise periods of our option contracts generally range from one to ten years. Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options. Some option contracts contain a predetermined take down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, we are not required to purchase land in accordance with those take down schedules. In substantially all instances, we have the right and ability to not exercise our option and forfeit our deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of our deposit and pre acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, we do not consider the take down price to be a firm contractual obligation. When we intend not to exercise an option, we write off any deposit and pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. For the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we wrote off $1.8 million, $3.1 million and $84.4 million, respectively, of option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to homesites under option that we do not intend to purchase. 53 Table of Contents The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties (optioned) or unconsolidated joint ventures (JVs) (i.e., controlled homesites) at November 30, 2011 and 2010: Controlled Homesites November 30, 2011 Optioned JVs Total OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites East 4,017 423 4,440 30,595 35,035 Central 1,204 1,217 2,421 15,663 18,084 West 464 6,111 6,575 27,884 34,459 Southeast Florida 1,112 323 1,435 6,039 7,474 Houston 1,384 296 1,680 9,791 11,471 Other 133 18 151 4,712 4,863 Total homesites 8,314 8,388 16,702 94,684 111,386 Controlled Homesites November 30, 2010 Optioned JVs Total OwnedHomesites TotalHomesites East 4,383 1,308 5,691 26,786 32,477 Central 1,061 1,721 2,782 16,236 19,018 West 304 7,753 8,057 26,213 34,270 Southeast Florida 836 323 1,159 4,337 5,496 Houston 1,431 305 1,736 5,926 7,662 Other 475 74 549 4,984 5,533 Total homesites 8,490 11,484 19,974 84,482 104,456 We evaluate all option contracts for land to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, we are required to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During the year ended November 30, 2011, the effect of consolidation of these option contracts was a net increase of $15.0 million to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in our consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2011. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, we reclassified the related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2011. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits. The increase to consolidated inventory not owned was offset by our exercise of options to acquire land under previously consolidated contracts, resulting in a net decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of $65.7 million for the year ended November 30, 2011. Our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $156.8 million and $157.4 million, respectively, at November 30, 2011 and 2010. Additionally, we had posted $44.1 million and $48.9 million, respectively, of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November 30, 2011 and 2010. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at November 30, 2011: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years Lennar Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable $ 3,362,759 182,787 635,880 851,823 1,692,269 Lennar Financial Services Notes and other debts payable 410,134 410,101 30 3 Interest commitments under interest bearing debt (1) 923,740 183,528 321,282 232,979 185,951 Rialto Investments Notes payable (2) 765,541 169,575 527,972 65,693 2,301 Operating leases 101,088 29,994 38,558 20,368 12,168 Other contractual obligations (3) 35,250 35,250 Total contractual obligations (4) $ 5,598,512 1,011,235 1,523,722 1,170,866 1,892,689 (1) Interest commitments on variable interest bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of November 30, 2011. (2) Amount includes $626.9 million of notes payable that was consolidated as part of the LLC consolidation related to the FDIC transaction and is non recourse to Lennar; however, at November 30, 2011 $219.4 million of cash collections on loans in excess of expenses had been deposited in a defeasance account established for the repayment of the FDIC notes payable. (3) Commitments to fund Rialto segments equity investments ($7.5 million in the AB PPIP fund and $27.8 million in the Fund). (4) Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $36.7 million as of November 30, 2011, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2011, we had access to 16,702 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2011, we had $156.8 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and $44.1 million of letters of credit posted in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts. At November 30, 2011, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $267.3 million (which included the $44.1 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2011, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects in our joint ventures) of $628.1 million. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2011, there were approximately $331.5 million, or 53%, of costs to complete related to these site improvements. We do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds, but if any such draws occur, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our Lennar Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $550.5 million at November 30, 2011. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers and builder commitments for loan programs totaled $197.8 million as of November 30, 2011. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities (MBS) forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At November 30, 2011, we had open commitments amounting to $379.8 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2012. 55 Table of Contents The following sections discuss economic conditions, market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business: Economic Conditions Throughout 2011, we continued to see a housing market that was trying to stabilize. We have seen demand for home purchases slowly return to the market place driven by a combination of low home prices and low interest rates. Our sales of homes revenue was flat with prior year, our home deliveries decreased 1% and our new orders increased 4% year over year. In addition, our gross margins on home sales increased to $523.4 million, or 19.9%, in the year ended November 30, 2011, from $517.9 million, or 19.7%, in the year ended November 30, 2010. The improvement in gross margins was primarily due to lower valuation adjustments and deliveries from the new higher margin communities that we have been investing in, offset by an unfavorable comparison year over year as a result of the third party recoveries relating to Chinese drywall that were included in our gross margins on home sales in 2010. In addition, the year ended November 30, 2011, was our second year of profitability with net earnings of $92.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $95.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, during the year ended November 30, 2010. Market and Financing Risk We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Rialto activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations, debt issuances, equity issuances, as well as borrowings under our warehouse repurchase facilities. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the option. We tried to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believed to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we viewed as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and, until recent years, limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative, we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered since 2007. Seasonality We have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business. Interest Rates and Changing Prices Inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, (ASU 2010 06), which requires additional disclosures about transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. We adopted ASU 2010 06 for its second quarter ended May 31, 2010, except for the Level 3 activity disclosures which will be effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2011. ASU 2010 06 has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 20, Disclosures About the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses, (ASU 2010 20). ASU 2010 20 enhances current disclosure requirements to assist users of financial statements in assessing an entitys credit risk exposure and evaluating the adequacy of an entitys allowance for credit losses. ASU 2010 20 requires entities to disclose the nature of credit risk inherent in their finance receivables, the procedure for analyzing and assessing credit risk, and the changes in both the receivables and the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment and class. ASU 2010 20 was effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2010. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 02, A Creditors Determination of Whether Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, (ASU 2011 02). ASU 2011 02 clarifies when a loan modification or restructuring is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). In determining whether a loan modification represents a TDR, an entity should consider whether the debtor 56 Table of Contents is experiencing financial difficulty and the lender has granted a concession to the borrower. This guidance is to be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted. ASU 2011 02 is effective for loan modifications that occur on or after September 1, 2011. ASU 2011 02 did not have a material effect on the our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, (ASU 2011 04). ASU 2011 04 amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, (ASC 820), providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011 04 changes certain fair value measurement principles, clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the ASC 820 disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011 04 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, but may require certain additional disclosures. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011 05 will be effective for our quarter ending May 31, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, but will require a change in the presentation of our comprehensive income from the notes of the consolidated financial statements, where it is currently disclosed, to the face of the consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, (ASU 2011 08), which amends the guidance in ASC 350 20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill. Under ASU 2011 08, entities have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined, based on qualitative factors, to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then entities are required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. ASU 2011 08 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2011 08 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are assessed each reporting period by us based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. At November 30, 2011, we continued our evaluation of whether the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was still needed. Although our strong performance and current positioning is bringing us closer to a conclusion that a valuation allowance is no longer needed, further evidence of a market recovery is needed to reverse our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 57 Table of Contents Therefore, based upon an evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, we concluded we still needed a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $576.9 million and $609.5 million, respectively, at November 30, 2011 and 2010. During the year ended November 30, 2011, we recorded a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $32.6 million due primarily to net earnings generated during the year. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $37.9 million primarily due to the recording of a deferred tax liability from the issuance of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes, and the net earnings generated during the year. The reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the issuance of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. In future periods, the allowance could be reduced if sufficient positive evidence is present indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized. At both November 30, 2011 and 2010, we had no net deferred tax assets. We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results, which may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Lennar Homebuilding Operations Revenue Recognition Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Inventories Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were 420 and 440 active communities as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its fair value. In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, we identify communities whose carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. Although gross margins for all of our homebuilding segments, and Homebuilding Other for the year ended November 30, 2011 have remained constant compared to the year ended November 30, 2010, revenues of our Homebuilding West and Homebuilding Houston segments and Homebuilding Other decreased 18%, 10% and 4%, respectively, for the year ended November 30, 2011, compared to the year ended November 30, 2010 due to a decrease in absorption pace. We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above. For example, since the start of the downturn in the housing market, we have found ways to reduce our construction costs in many communities, and this reduction in construction costs in addition to changes in product type in many communities has impacted future estimated cash flows. 58 Table of Contents Each of the homebuilding markets in which we operate is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of our homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. Our projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver our homes on a community by community basis. In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in our cash flow models, we analyze our historical absorption pace in the community as well as other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, we consider internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing our historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies, we place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in our most recent quarters as well as forecasted population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product. Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace in the cash flow model for a community. In order to determine the assumed sales prices included in our cash flow models, we analyze the historical sales prices realized on homes we delivered in the community and other comparable communities in the geographical area as well as the sales prices included in our current backlog for such communities. In addition, we consider internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices on similar products in non neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing our historical sales prices and corresponding market studies, we also place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as future forecasted sales prices in neighboring communities as well as future forecasted sales prices for similar product in non neighboring communities. Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected sales prices in the cash flow model for a community. In order to arrive at our assumed costs to build and deliver our homes, we generally assume a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Costs assumed in our cash flow models for our communities are generally based on the rates we are currently obligated to pay under existing contracts with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Since the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future. Using all the available information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. We generally use a discount rate of approximately 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. We estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. For example, further market deterioration or changes in our assumptions may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory, as well as on inventory not currently impaired, but for which indicators of impairment may arise if further market deterioration occurs. We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. Our option contracts are recorded at cost. In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property under option. If we intend to walk away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract. We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of 59 Table of Contents recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, managements projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future. During the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded the following inventory impairments: Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes (1) $ 35,726 44,717 180,239 Valuation adjustments to land we intend to sell or have sold to third parties 456 3,436 95,314 Write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs 1,784 3,105 84,372 $ 37,966 51,258 359,925 (1) Valuation adjustments to finished homes, CIP and land on which we intend to build homes for the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 relate to 38 communities, 33 communities and 131 communities, respectively. The valuation adjustments were estimated based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the valuation adjustments were recorded, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and Homebuilding Other. Warranty Costs Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment. At November 30, 2011, the reserve for warranty costs was $88.1 million, which included $9.1 million related to Defective Chinese drywall that was purchased and installed by various of our subcontractors. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve. Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as Lennar Homebuilding Equity in Loss from Unconsolidated Entities, as described in Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance. 60 Table of Contents Management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence. As of November 30, 2011, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2011, the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $3.3 billion and total liabilities of $1.2 billion. We evaluate our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The evaluation of our investment in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. Such inventory is also reviewed for potential impairment by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. The review for inventory impairment performed by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities is materially consistent with our process, as discussed above, for evaluating our own inventory as of the end of a reporting period. The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of approximately 20% in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in our Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our Lennar Homebuilding investment in unconsolidated entities. In certain instances, we may be required to record additional losses relating to our Lennar Homebuilding investment in unconsolidated entities; if our investment in the unconsolidated entity, or a portion thereof, is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. These losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income (expense), net. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived. In addition, we believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future. Additionally, we consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other than temporary. These factors include age of the venture, stage in its life cycle, intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity, financial condition and long term prospects of the entity, short term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investments, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded. 61 Table of Contents During the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded the following valuation adjustments related to our Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities: Years Ended November 30, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Our share of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities $ 8,869 10,461 101,893 Valuation adjustments to Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities 10,489 1,735 88,972 $ 19,358 12,196 190,865 These valuation adjustments were calculated based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the valuation adjustments were recorded, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document for details related to valuation adjustments and write offs by reportable segment and homebuilding other. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. The accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment. Generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared between all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JVs assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market. Generally, our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions. Financial Services Operations Revenue Recognition Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policies. Escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held for sale and loans held for investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue. Loan Origination Liabilities Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we 62 Table of Contents breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreement. There has been an increased industry wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses in an unfavorable economic environment by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. Our mortgage operations has established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. We establish reserves for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While we believe that we have adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimate. Goodwill At both November 30, 2011 and 2010, our goodwill was $34.0 million, which is part of our Lennar Financial Services segment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis. Inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate. We review goodwill annually (or whenever indicators of impairment exist) for impairment. Due to operating losses in the title operations of our Lennar Financial Services segment, we evaluated the carrying value of our Lennar Financial Services segments goodwill in both our third and fourth quarters of 2011. We estimated the fair value of our Financial Services title operations based on the income approach and concluded that a goodwill impairment was not required for 2011. The income approach establishes fair value by methods which discount or capitalize earnings and or cash flow by a discount or capitalization rate that reflects market rate of return expectations, market conditions and the risk of the relative investment. We used a discounted cash flow method when applying the income approach. This analysis includes operating income, interest expense, taxes and incremental working capital, as well as other factors. The projections used in the analysis are for a five year period and represent what we consider to be normalized earnings. In determining the fair value of our Lennar Financial Services title operations under the income approach, our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions. The most significant assumptions affecting our expected cash flows are the discount rate, projected revenue growth rate and operating profit margin. The impact of a change in any of our significant underlying assumptions +/ 1% would not result in a materially different fair value. During the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not record goodwill impairment charges. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, there were no material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill. Rialto Investments Loans Receivable Revenue Recognition All of the acquired loans for which (1) there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and (2) for which it was deemed probable that we would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments were accounted under ASC Topic 310 30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, (ASC 310 30). For loans accounted for under ASC 310 30, management determined upon acquisition the loans value based on due diligence on each of the loans, the underlying properties and the borrowers. We determined fair value by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider when determining fair value. Factors considered in the valuation were projected cash flows for the loans, type of loan and related collateral, classification status and current discount rates. Since the estimates are based on projections, all estimates are subjective and can change due to unexpected changes in economic conditions and loan performance. Under ASC 310 30, loans were pooled together according to common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single component interest rate and as aggregate expectation of cash flows. The excess of the cash flows expected to be collected over the cost of the loans acquired is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the 63 Table of Contents remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. This difference is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our Rialto segment periodically evaluates its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on its portfolios. These evaluations require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to those used in the initial estimate of fair value of the loans to allocate purchase price. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield. Increases in the cash flows expected to be collected will generally result in an increase in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans. Decreases in expected cash flows due to further deterioration will generally result in an impairment recognized as a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Prepayments are treated as a reduction of cash flows expected to be collected and a reduction of contractually required payments such that the nonaccretable difference is not affected. We believe that the accounting related to loans with deteriorated credit quality and that the accounting for accretable yield are critical accounting policies because of the significant judgment involved. Nonaccrual Loans Revenue Recognition & Impairment At November 30, 2011 and 2010, there were loans receivable with a carrying value of approximately $74 million and $253 million, respectively, for which interest income was not being recognized as they were classified as nonaccrual. When forecasted principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated at the loan acquisition date, management classifies the loan as nonaccrual and accounts for these assets in accordance with ASC 310 10, Receivable, (ASC 310 10). When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, any subsequent cash receipt is accounted for using the cost recovery method. In accordance with ASC 310 10, a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events; it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. A provision for loan losses is recognized when the recorded investment in the loan is in excess of its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined by using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting for nonaccrual loans is a critical accounting estimate. Real Estate Owned REO represents real estate that our Rialto segment has taken control or has effective control of in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition of a property through foreclosure of a loan, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell if classified as held for sale or at fair value if classified as held and used, which becomes the propertys new basis. The fair values of these assets are determined in part by placing reliance on third party appraisals of the properties and or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity. The third party appraisals and internally developed analyses are significantly impacted by the local market economy, market supply and demand, competitive conditions and prices on comparable properties, adjusted for date of sale, location, property size, and other factors. Each REO is unique and is analyzed in the context of the particular market where the property is located. In order to establish the significant assumptions for a particular REO, we analyze historical trends, including trends achieved by our local homebuilding operations, if applicable, and current trends in the market and economy impacting the REO. Using available trend information, we then calculate our best estimate of fair value, which can include projected cash flows discounted at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. Changes in economic factors, consumer demand and market conditions, among other things, could materially impact estimates used in the third party appraisals and or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties. Thus, estimates can differ significantly from the amounts ultimately realized by our Rialto segment from disposition of these assets. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is less than the REOs fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held for sale), is recorded as an unrealized gain on foreclosure in our consolidated statement of operations. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REOs fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held for sale) is initially recorded as an impairment in our consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, REO includes real estate which Rialto has purchased directly from financial institutions. These REOs are recorded at cost or allocated cost if purchased in a bulk transaction. Subsequent to obtaining REO via foreclosure or directly from a financial institution, management periodically performs valuations using the methodologies described above such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent valuation adjustments, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in our Rialto Investments other income, net. REO assets classified as held and used 64 Table of Contents are depreciated using a useful life of forty years for commercial properties and twenty seven and a half years for residential properties. Our REO assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated. Occasionally an asset will required certain improvements to yield a higher return. In accordance with ASC 970 340 25, Real Estate, construction costs incurred prior to acquisition or during development of the asset may be capitalized. We believe that the accounting for REO is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required in the third party appraisals and or internally prepared analysis of recent offers or prices comparable properties in the proximate vicinity used to estimate the fair value of the REOs. Consolidations of Variable Interest Entities In 2010, our Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies (LLCs), in partnership with the FDIC. We determined that each of the LLCs met the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE) and we were the primarily beneficiary. In accordance with ASC 810 10 65 2, Consolidations, (ASC 810 10 65 2), we identified the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance and determined that we have the power to direct those activities. The economic performance of the LLCs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the LLCs portfolios of assets, which consist primarily of distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans. Thus, the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance are the servicing and disposition of mortgage loans and real estate obtained through foreclosure of loans, restructuring of loans, or other planned activities associated with the monetizing of loans. The FDIC does not have the unilateral power to terminate our role in managing the LLCs and servicing the loan portfolio. While the FDIC has the right to prevent certain types of transactions (i.e., bulk sales, selling assets with recourse back to the selling entity, selling assets with representations and warranties and financing the sales of assets without the FDICs approval), the FDIC does not have full voting or blocking rights over the LLCs activities, making their voting rights protective in nature, not substantive participating voting rights. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, which are not the primary activities of the LLCs, we can cause the LLCs to enter into both the disposition and restructuring of loans without any involvement of the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC has no voting rights with regard to the operation/management of the operating properties that are acquired upon foreclosure of loans (e.g. REO) and no voting rights over the business plans of the LLCs. The FDIC can make suggestions regarding the business plans, but we can decide not to follow the FDICs suggestions and not to incorporate them in the business plans. Since the FDICs voting rights are protective in nature and not substantive participating voting rights, we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance. In accordance with ASC 810 10 65 2, we determined that we has an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs or the right to receive benefits from the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs based on the following factors: Rialto/Lennar owns 40% of the equity of the LLCs. The LLCs have issued notes to the FDIC totaling $626.9 million. The notes issued by the LLCs must be repaid before any distributions can be made with regard to the equity. Accordingly, the equity of the LLCs has the obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs up to the amount of the notes issued. Rialto/Lennar has a management/servicer contract under which we earn a 0.5% servicing fee. Rialto/Lennar has guaranteed, as the servicer, its obligations under the servicing agreement up to $10 million. We are aware that the FDIC, as the owner of 60% of the equity of each of the LLCs, may also have an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs. However, in accordance with ASC Topic 810 10 25 38A, only one enterprise, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Since both criteria for consolidation in ASC 810 10 65 2 are met, we consolidated the LLCs. We believe that our assessment that we are the primary beneficiary of the LLCs is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required in evaluating all of the key factors and circumstances in determining the primary beneficiary. 65 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. The table below provides information at November 30, 2011 about our significant financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For loans held for sale, loans held for investment, net and investments held to maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values at November 30, 2011. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at November 30, 2011. Rialto Investments loans receivable are not included in the table below because income is recorded through accretable yield due to the loans acquired having deteriorated credit quality, thus we believe they are not sensitive to changes in interest rates. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk. 66 Table of Contents Information Regarding Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal (Notional) Amount by Expected Maturity and Average Interest Rate November 30, 2011 Years Ending November 30, Fair Value atNovember 30, (Dollars in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total 2011 ASSETS Lennar Homebuilding: Investments available for sale: Fixed rate $ 42.9 42.9 42.9 Average interest rate 6.0 % 6.0 % Rialto Investments: Investments held to maturity: Fixed rate $ 14.1 14.1 14.0 Average interest rate 4.0. % 4.0 % Lennar Financial Services: Loans held for sale: Fixed rate $ 295.3 295.3 295.3 Average interest rate 4.1 % 4.1 % Variable rate $ 8.5 8.5 8.5 Average interest rate 2.7 % 2.7 % Loans held for investment, net and Investments held to maturity: Fixed rate $ 34.6 15.3 0.6 0.7 0.7 15.9 67.8 65.3 Average interest rate 0.9 % 1.5 % 6.4 % 6.6 % 6.6 % 6.1 % 2.4 % Variable rate $ 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 4.7 5.4 5.1 Average interest rate 3.6 % 3.6 % 3.7 % 3.7 % 3.8 % 4.3 % 4.2 % LIABILITIES Lennar Homebuilding: Senior notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 12.0 274.7 262.7 503.5 286.3 1,681.5 3,020.7 3,124.3 Average interest rate 3.4 % 5.9 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 6.6 % 5.6 % 5.7 % Variable rate $ 170.8 56.5 42.0 22.5 39.5 10.8 342.1 366.9 Average interest rate 4.5 % 10.1 % 8.7 % 10.4 % 4.1 % 3.3 % 6.2 % Rialto Investments: Notes Payable: Fixed rate (1) $ 158.0 316.5 158.5 1.2 5.1 2.3 641.6 626.8 Average interest rate 0.1 % 6.0 % 6.2 % 5.9 % 0.1 % Variable rate $ 11.5 20.0 33.0 33.0 26.4 123.9 103.1 Average interest rate 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % Lennar Financial Services: Notes and other debts payable: Fixed rate $ 0.1 0.1 0.1 Average interest rate 8.0 % 8.0 % Variable rate $ 410.0 410.0 410.0 Average interest rate 3.4 % 3.4 % 67 Table of Contents
