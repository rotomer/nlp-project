Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General During 2001, the Company experienced strong growth, primarily as a result of continued implementation of its strategic plan. The Company further expanded its managed care business while strengthening its scientific expertise and market share through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. The Company completed two important acquisitions during the current year. Path Lab Holdings, Inc., acquired in May 2001, is the largest regional laboratory in New England with annual revenues in 2000 of approximately $51.6 million. This acquisition not only expanded the Companys geographic coverage, but also helped leverage the Companys expertise in esoteric testing. Path Lab has particular skill in servicing hospitals in the New England market. Hospitals generally have a need for higher value esoteric testing. The acquisition of Minneapolis based Viro Med Inc. in June 2001, further strengthened the Companys leadership position in infectious disease testing. In addition, Viro Meds specialized laboratory space provides significant additional esoteric testing capacity and the flexibility to more efficiently direct testing workflow throughout the country. Viro Med had clinical laboratory revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 of approximately $25.2 million. In December 2001, the Company entered into exclusive licensing and marketing relationships with EXACT Sciences and Myriad Genetics. Under the agreement with EXACT Sciences, the Company will be the only national clinical laboratory to offer testing services based on certain of EXACT Sciences proprietary technologies for the detection of colorectal cancer. The agreement with Myriad Genetics allows the Company to market Myriads predictive medicine markers for hypertension, melanoma, breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers to the Companys more than 200,000 primary care physicians. While the Company believes both of these agreements will have a favorable impact on its operating results going forward, it is too early in each relationship to reliably quantify their impact in 2002. In addition to the acquisitions and relationships discussed above, the Company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors: 1) The expansion of higher value genomic tests such as Cystic Fibrosis, HCV and HIV genotyping is occurring, along with the continued growth of HIV viral loads and HPV testing; 2) Continued conversion of traditional pap smears to the newer, high value monolayer technology; 3) Additional product licensing and business relationships (such as Myriad Genetics and Exact Sciences); 4) The Companys ongoing business acquisition strategy; 5) Growing demand for genomic testing will create a positive shift in test mix to higher value testing; and 6) Improving regulatory and reimbursement environment in Washington. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", is expected to have a positive impact on the 2002 financial statements. The application of this new statement will result in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately $26.0 million for 2002. During 2001, the Company was involved in several transactions affecting its capital structure. On May 24, 2001, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to the restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of common shares authorized from 52 million shares to 265 million shares. On June 11, 2001, the Company effected a two for one stock split through the issuance of a stock dividend of one new share of common stock for each share of common stock held by shareholders of record on June 4, 2001. The Company also assisted in the successful placement of 12.0 million shares of the Companys common stock formerly owned by Roche, and increased the number of shares traded in the open market and available for purchase by other investors. During September and October 2001, the Company sold $744.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") due 2021 in a private placement. The Company received approximately $488.6 million net of approximately $11.2 million in underwriting fees. See "Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for a further discussion of the Notes. In early 2002, Standard & Poors upgraded the Companys corporate credit and bank loan ratings from BBB to BBB+. This investment grade rating offers the Company additional financial flexibility as growth opportunities are identified. On February 21, 2002, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S 3, seeking to register approximately 7.7 million shares (including 700,000 shares subject to an overallotment option) of the Companys common stock, currently owned by Roche. It is anticipated that the offering of these shares will be consummated sometime during March 2002 subject to prevailing market conditions. The sale by Roche of these shares will reduce their ownership interest in the Companys common stock to 5.24% (4.25% if the overallotment option is exercised in full) compared to 15.13% as of December 31, 2001. Seasonality Volume of testing generally declines during the year end holiday periods and other major holidays. In addition, volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets, amortization lives for intangible assets and accruals for self insurance reserves. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical collection trends, the aging of accounts, current economic conditions and regulatory changes. The deferred tax valuation allowance brings the Companys net deferred tax assets to a level where management believes that it is more likely than not the tax benefits will be realized. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years for goodwill, legal life for patents and technology, 10 to 25 years for customer lists and contractual lives for non compete agreements. Management periodically reviews the Companys operating and financial performance in order to determine whether it should revise its estimates of the useful lives or whether circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the Companys goodwill or other long lived assets may not be recoverable. Accruals for self insurance reserves (including workers compensation, auto, employee medical and professional liability) are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history, along with current and estimated future economic conditions. While management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent; they are, by their very nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. See "Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of significant accounting policies. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2001 compared with Year ended December 31, 2000. Net sales for 2001 were $2,199.8 million, an increase of 14.6% from $1,919.3 million reported in the comparable 2000 period. Sales increased approximately 8.2% due to an increase in volume and 5.9% due to an increase in price per accession (which reflects actual price increases and changes in the mix of tests performed). These increases occurred as a result of the Companys success in winning new business as well as retaining and increasing business from existing customers. Excluding acquisitions, revenues would have increased 10.6%. Cost of sales, which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs, was $1,274.2 million for 2001 compared to $1,152.7 million in the corresponding 2000 period, an increase of 10.5%. The majority of the increase in cost of sales is due to an increase in volume (approximately $95.0 million), with an additional increase of $13.0 million due to increases in the volume of pap smear tests performed using monolayer technology. In addition, the Company incurred incremental costs of approximately $6.0 million as it implemented a self mandated safety needle program in all of its patient service centers. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 57.9% for 2001 and 60.0% in the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from higher margin test mix, continued cost reduction efforts and economies of scale achieved through volume growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $516.5 million in 2001 from $483.0 million in the same period in 2000 representing an increase of $33.5 million or 6.9%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.5% and 25.2% as a percentage of net sales in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the Companys acquisitions during the year combined with additional bad debt expense as a result of the increase in net sales. Interest expense was $27.0 million in 2001 compared to $38.5 million in 2000. During September 2001, the Company repaid its outstanding term loan balance of $412.5 million with the proceeds from the sale of zero coupon subordinated notes. During the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an $8.9 million loss relating to a payment made to terminate an interest rate swap agreement tied to the Companys term loan. In addition, the Company recorded a $3.2 million extraordinary loss, net of tax benefit, representing the write off of unamortized bank fees associated with the retired term debt. See "Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a further discussion of zero coupon subordinated notes. Also, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Provision for income taxes was $149.6 million in 2001 compared to $95.5 million in 2000. The effective tax rate was 45.0% in 2001 and 46.0% in 2000. The decrease in the effective rate reflects the increase in the Companys pre tax earnings relative to the amount of non deductible amortization of intangible assets. See "Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a further discussion of income taxes. Year ended December 31, 2000 compared with Year ended December 31, 1999. Net sales for 2000 were $1,919.3 million, an increase of 13.0% from $1,698.7 million reported in the comparable 1999 period. Sales increased approximately 9.0% due to an increase in volume and 4.0% due to an increase in price per accession (which reflects actual price increases and changes in the mix of tests performed). These increases occurred as a result of the Companys ability to win new business and successfully retain and increase business from existing customers. Excluding acquisitions, revenues would have increased 11.6%. Cost of sales, which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs, was $1,152.7 million for 2000 compared to $1,069.6 million in the corresponding 1999 period, an increase of 7.8%. Cost of sales increased approximately $91.0 million due to an increase in volume offset by labor efficiencies due to streamlining of operations. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 60.0% for 2000 and 63.0% in the corresponding 1999 period. The decrease in the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from continued cost reduction efforts and economies of scale achieved through volume growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $483.0 million in 2000 from $448.2 million in the same period in 1999 representing an increase of $34.8 million or 7.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 25.2% and 26.4% as a percentage of net sales in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the Companys acquisitions during the year combined with billing conversion related costs such as salaries and telephone expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $4.5 million restructuring charge relating to the closing of its Drug Testing laboratory in Memphis, Tennessee. These operations were absorbed by other Company facilities. This restructuring was completed during the second quarter of 2001 and resulted in annualized cost reductions of approximately $7.0 million. Interest expense was $38.5 million in 2000 compared to $41.6 million in 1999. This decrease is related to the Companys reduction in its outstanding debt of approximately $95.0 million. Provision for income taxes was $95.5 million in 2000 compared to $40.1 million in 1999. The effective rate was 46.0% in 2000 and 38.0% in 1999. The increase in the effective rate was due primarily to the Companys reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 1999. See "Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements". Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $316.0 million, $246.7 million and $180.5 million, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations in both 2001 and 2000 primarily resulted from overall improved operating results. Capital expenditures were $88.1 million, $55.5 million and $69.4 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $85.0 million in 2002. These expenditures are intended to continue to improve information systems and further automate laboratory processes. Such expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations as well as borrowings under the Companys new senior credit facilities. The Companys DSO at the end of 2001 improved to 58 days as compared to 68 days at the end of 2000. This improvement was due to Company wide efforts to increase cash collections from all payors, as well as on going improvements to claim submission processes. In addition, the Company continued to take steps necessary to improve DSO and cash collections by: 1. Substantially completing the conversion of decentralized billing locations to a centralized billing system. During 2001, the Chicago, San Antonio, and Dallas locations were converted. 2. Implementing an initiative to reduce the number of requisitions received that are missing certain billing information. The billing system conversions, combined with improvements in front end processes that enhance data capture for billing, are expected to reduce DSO to the mid 50s by the end of 2002. During September 2001, the Company repaid its outstanding balance of $412.5 million on its term loan facility with the proceeds from the issuance of zero coupon subordinated notes. Interest expense on the zero coupon subordinated notes in the financial statements is computed based on the notes original issue discount amortization for an effective rate of 2% per year. This non cash interest expense will total approximately $12.0 million in 2002 as compared to interest expense of $27.0 million in 2001 (primarily related to the Companys retired term debt). As the Company does not pay any interest on the zero coupon subordinated notes prior to their maturity on September 11, 2021 (unless certain contingencies are met), the replacement of the Companys long term debt with the zero coupon subordinated notes will result in increases to the Companys available cash. This reduction in cash interest expense and the resulting retention of operating cash flows in the business is expected to provide the Company increased flexibility in pursuing strategic investments through possible acquisitions, technology purchases and key business relationships. In February 2002, the Company entered into two new senior credit facilities with Credit Suisse First Boston, acting as Administrative Agent, and a group of financial institutions totaling $300 million. The new facilities will consist of a 364 day revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $100 million and a three year revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $200 million. The new facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, funding or share repurchases and other payments, and acquisitions. Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due by Period 1 Yr 2 3 Yrs 4 5 Yrs > 5 Yrs Capital lease obligations $ 3.0 $ 5.4 $ 5.7 $ 1.2 Operating leases 43.7 60.2 33.1 38.9 Contingent future acquisition Payments 17.5 7.0 Zero coupon subordinated notes 530.5(a) Total contractual cash obligations $ 64.2 $603.1 $ 38.8 $ 40.1 (a) Holders of the zero coupon subordinated notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2004, 2006 and 2011 at prices ranging from $712.97 to $819.54 per note. The Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. If the holders elect to require the Company to purchase their notes, it is the Companys current intention to retire the notes by a cash payment. Based upon current market conditions, the Company believes that the possibility of the holders of the notes exercising this put feature of the notes is remote. However, future market conditions are subject to change. Should the holders put the notes to the Company on any of the dates above, the Company believes that it will be able to obtain alternate financing to satisfy this contingent cash obligation. Other Commercial Commitments At December 31, 2001, the Company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $36.6 million, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. These letters of credit are secured by the Companys senior credit facilities and are renewed annually, around mid year. Based on current and projected levels of operations, coupled with availability under its new senior credit facilities, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its short term and long term cash needs.

For a discussion of the Companys new senior credit facilities, see "Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements." FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The Company has made in this report, and from time to time may otherwise make in its public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward looking statements concerning the Companys operations, performance and financial condition, as well as its strategic objectives.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. There were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2001. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. There were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2001. The Companys zero coupon subordinated notes contain the following three features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under FAS No. 133: 1) The Company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon subordinated notes after September 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) Contingent additional principal will accrue on the zero coupon subordinated notes during the two year period from September 11, 2004 to September 11, 2006, if the Companys stock price is at or below specified thresholds. 3) Holders may surrender zero coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero coupon subordinated notes by Standard & Poors Ratings Services is BB or lower. Based upon independent appraisals, these embedded derivatives had no fair market value at December 31, 2001.
