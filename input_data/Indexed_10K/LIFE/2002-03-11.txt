Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We develop, manufacture, and market products for the life sciences markets. Our products are principally research tools in reagent and kit form, biochemicals, sera, media and other products and services that we sell to corporate, government, and academic entities. We focus our business on two principal segments: Molecular Biology. We are a leading supplier of research kits that simplify and improve gene cloning, gene expression, and gene analysis techniques. We also supply a full range of related molecular biology products including enzymes, nucleic acids and other biochemicals and reagents. 21 Cell Culture. We are also a leading supplier of sera, cell and tissue culture media and reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce pharmaceuticals and other materials made by cultured cells. Our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture products are used for research purposes, and, their use by our customers is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our Cell Culture Products and manufacturing sites are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations (formerly known as current good manufacturing practice, or "GMP") described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Carlsbad and San Diego, California; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Inchinnan, Scotland; and Huntsville, Alabama. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We also have manufacturing facilities in Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Brazil, and Israel. We sell our products throughout the world via subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries. The majority of our sales activities are conducted through a dedicated direct sales organization located in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We also conduct marketing and distribution activities through our subsidiaries. Additionally, we sell through international distributors who resell Invitrogen kits and products. These distributors are located primarily in selected territories in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia. We may choose in the future to establish a direct sales organization in these and additional territories. We conduct research activities in the United States and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Our revenues have increased significantly since our inception. The increase in our revenues has been due to several factors, including acquisitions, the continued growth of the market for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis kits, cell culture products and other products and related services; increasing market acceptance of these kits and products; our introduction of new research kits and products for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis; and the expansion of our direct sales and marketing efforts. We plan to continue to introduce new research kits, as we believe continued new product development and rapid product introduction is a critical competitive factor in the market for molecular biology research kits. To support increased levels of sales and to augment our long term competitive position, we may increase expenditures in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, although we are continuing to streamline our operations in an effort to realize cost savings following the Life Technologies merger. Except for our oligonucleotide and services businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We have acquired a significant number of licenses to use patented technologies from third parties as part of our business activities. We use these licenses as a basis for the development of many of our research kits and other products. We pay royalties to such third parties relating to sales of these research kits, other products and selected services. Royalty expense is recognized as a cost of revenue as the related royalties are incurred. 22 On September 14, 2000, we completed our mergers with Life Technologies and Dexter. Substantially all of the businesses and operations of Dexter were sold prior to the closing of the mergers. Both transactions have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which significantly affects the comparability of the financial information presented. On June 21, 2000, February 2, 2000, and August 17, 1999, we completed our acquisitions of Ethrog, Research Genetics and NOVEX, respectively. These transactions have been accounted for as pooling of interests, and the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined financial and operating results of Invitrogen, Ethrog, Research Genetics and NOVEX. Effective in the first quarter of 2001, we reorganized into two lines of business, a Molecular Biology segment and a Cell Culture segment and are reporting results by segment for 2001. Segment financial information for Molecular Biology and Cell Culture prior to 2001 has not been provided, as it would be impracticable to do so. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the dominant currency in the respective country of residence of the subsidiary. The translation from the functional currency to the U.S. Dollar for revenue and expenses is based on the average exchange rate during the period. Large increases or decreases in the spread between currencies have affected and may continue to affect our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, and income or losses. Certain of our subsidiaries also conduct their business in the currencies of their significant customers. Exchange gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. Large increases or decreases in these currency fluctuations could also have an impact on our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and income or losses. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results." In addition, our results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors and the mix of sales among distributors and our direct sales force. Although we have experienced growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain revenue growth or become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis or that our growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts. 23  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Business Segment Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2001. Molecular Biology Cell Culture Corporate And Unallocated(1) Total (In Thousands) Segment Results Revenues from external customers $ 414,241 $ 215,049 $ $ 629,290 Gross margin $ 251,780 $ 94,485 $ (2,677 ) $ 343,588 Gross margin as a percentage of revenues 61 % 44 % 55 % Selling, administrative and R&D 156,051 45,242 15,356 216,649 Merger related amortization and costs 277,547 277,547 Income (loss) from operations $ 95,729 $ 49,243 $ (295,580 ) $ (150,608 ) Operating margin as a percentage of revenues 23 % 23 % Pro forma Revenue Growth (unaudited) Revenues for the year 2001 $ 414,241 $ 215,049 $ 629,290 Adjust for effect of foreign exchange rates(2) 9,764 6,469 16,233 Currency adjusted revenues $ 424,005 $ 221,518 $ 645,523 Revenues for the year 2001 $ 414,241 $ 215,049 $ 629,290 Less revenues from discontinued products(3) (12,091 ) (29,859 ) (41,950 ) Revenues from continuing products 402,150 185,190 587,340 Adjust for effect of foreign exchange rates on continuing products(2) 9,269 5,268 14,537 Currency adjusted revenues from continuing products $ 411,419 $ 190,458 $ 601,877 Pro forma revenues for the year 2000(4) $ 365,683 (5) $ 201,294 (5) $ 566,977 Less revenues from discontinued products(4) (28,565 ) (36,345 ) (64,910 ) Pro forma revenues from continuing products(4) $ 337,118 $ 164,949 $ 502,067 Revenue growth for the year 2001 13 % 7 % 11 % Currency adjusted revenue growth 16 % 10 % 14 % Revenue growth for continuing products 19 % 12 % 17 % Currency adjusted revenue growth for continuing products 22 % 15 % 20 % (1)Unallocated items for the year ended December 31, 2001 include costs for purchase accounting inventory revaluations of $2.6 million, amortization of deferred compensation of $2.2 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of $266.2 million and merger costs of $11.3 million which are not allocated by management for purposes of analyzing the operations since they are principally non cash items resulting primarily from purchase accounting as well as company wide restructuring activities. (2)Changes in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in the prior year affected dollar denominated revenues. These adjustments are to arrive at dollar denominated revenues assuming foreign exchange rates that are constant with those during the comparable period of last year. (3)Subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. 24 (4)Pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, are provided on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. (5)2001 presentation of 2000 revenues by segment reflects a $1.0 million reallocation of revenues between segments due to changes in segment categorization of certain products. Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $383.1 million, or 156%, from $246.2 million in 2000 to $629.3 million for 2001. The acquisition of Life Technologies accounted for a significant portion of the increase in revenues. Due to the integration of our operations that began during the fourth quarter of 2000, the precise amount of the increase in revenues due to Life Technologies is not determinable. Additionally, subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Pro Forma and Segment Revenues. Pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, are provided on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. The pro forma revenues reported for 2000 by segment have been reallocated to conform to the segment classifications used in 2001. We have also provided revenue comparisons below on a foreign currency constant basis, in order to clarify for investors the changes in our revenues that are unrelated to foreign currency exchange effects. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased $62.3 million, or 11%, from pro forma revenues of $567.0 million in 2000 to $629.3 million in 2001. Changes in foreign exchange rates when comparing the year ended December 31, 2001, with the pro forma year of 2000 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $16.2 million. Holding foreign exchange rates constant with those during the year ended December 31, 2000 revenues during 2001 would have been $645.5 million, an increase of 14% from pro forma 2000 revenues. Molecular Biology Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $48.6 million, or 13%, from pro forma segment revenues of $365.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $414.2 million in 2001. The $414.2 million of Molecular Biology revenues in 2001 is comprised of $402.1 million of continuing products and $12.1 million of discontinued products. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign exchange rates reduced dollar denominated Molecular Biology revenues by $9.8 million when comparing 2001 with pro forma revenues of 2000. Holding foreign exchange rates constant with 2000, sales of continuing Molecular Biology products increased 22% from pro forma 2000 revenues. The 22% increase reflects primarily the continued growth of the market for product lines including cloning & gene expression, separation & analysis and amplification products, which increased 24% in 2001 on a currency comparable basis. Other product lines, including oligonucleotides, custom services, licensing and royalties, increased 13% on a currency comparable basis for the year ended December 31, 2001. On February 28, 2002, we announced that we are experiencing softness in our molecular biology segment. We believe the softness is attributable to several causes. For example, revenue from the sale of oligonucleotides and custom services is showing weakness. In addition, currency comparable revenue growth from molecular biology products, including cloning and expression, amplification and separation and analysis products is tracking at a 17% rate of growth for the first quarter of 2002 versus 23% for the fourth quarter of 2001. We have taken steps to address the softness in the molecular biology segment. For example, we have increased our manufacturing capacity for oligonucleotides, and we expect to increase our product offerings for custom services, including providing more full length clones and open open reading frames. However, if revenue for oligonucleotides and custom services continues to show weakness, or if revenue growth for molecular biology products continues at the reduced rate and is not offset by additional growth in other areas of our business, this could result in a negative impact on our revenue for 2002. In addition, the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese 25 Yen and the Euro, recently has declined against the U.S. Dollar. If these currencies remain at their current levels for all of 2002, reported revenue on sales made in these currencies will decrease and result in a negative impact on our revenue for 2002. Cell Culture Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Cell Culture segment for the year ended December 31 increased $13.8 million, or 7%, from pro forma segment revenues of $201.3 million in 2000 to $215.0 million in 2001. The $215.0 million of Cell Culture revenues in 2001 is comprised of $185.2 million of continuing products and $29.9 million of discontinued products, which includes revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign exchange rates during 2001 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $6.5 million. Holding foreign exchange rates constant with 2000, sales of continuing Cell Culture products increased 15% from pro forma 2000 revenues. This increase reflects sales of Cell Culture products for large scale production applications that increased 32% in 2001 on a currency comparable basis. These unaudited pro forma results for our two business segments have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the combinations been in effect on January 1, 2000, or of future results of operations. We expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, the continuing integration of Life Technologies in addition to new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets and U.S. government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, product discontinuations and foreign currency rates. If the recent decline of certain currencies, including the Japanese Yen and the Euro, against the U.S. Dollar remain at their current levels for all of 2002, reported revenue on sales made in these currencies will decrease and could result in a material negative impact on our revenue for 2002. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 55% compared with 49% for the same period in 2000. Cost of sales in 2000 included $16.6 million of merger related inventory valuation charges from the Life Technologies merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, inventories acquired in the merger are recorded at their fair value, which generally requires a non cash write up to estimated selling prices less the cost to sell or dispose of the inventory. Subsequent sales of this inventory result in costs of sales that are generally higher than our manufactured inventory, which is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Excluding this non cash incremental cost, gross margin was 56% in 2000. Consolidated gross margin for the periods after the merger with Life Technologies have been lower than Invitrogens consolidated gross margin before the merger principally because of the inclusion of lower margin products from the Life Technologies business. The Company has instituted various programs to improve gross margins since the Life Technologies merger, including cost reductions, price adjustments and the discontinuation or sale of lower margin product lines. Gross margins have improved since the fourth quarter of 2000, which was the first full quarter of combined company results. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2000 was 51%, excluding the merger related inventory valuation charges of $12.3 million recognized during that period. Gross margin for the Molecular Biology segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 61% and for the Cell Culture segment was 44%. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the continuing integration of Life Technologies in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, and foreign currency rates. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $66.5 million from $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $112.8 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 19% in 2000 to 18% in 2001. The reduction as a percentage of 26 revenues resulted from the addition of the Cell Culture segment from the Life Technologies merger which has a lower ratio of sales and marketing costs to revenues and to the closure of a distribution facility in the Netherlands. Additionally, 2000 included costs incurred for a new brand recognition program. The addition of Life Technologies accounted for the majority of the absolute increase for 2001. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $84.0 million, or 20% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $28.4 million, or 13% of segment revenues. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 increased $38.9 million from $26.8 million in 2000 to $65.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 11% in 2000 to 10% in 2001. The absolute increase during 2001 resulted from the addition of Life Technologies, higher legal costs for ongoing litigation to protect our patents, duplicate staffing at our Rockville and Carlsbad sites as we transitioned employees and functions to Carlsbad and continued expansion of administrative resources to support our growth. The decrease as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, occurred primarily because a fixed portion of our general and administrative expense was spread over a larger revenue base. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the Molecular Biology segment were $39.2 million, or 9% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $11.9 million, or 6% of segment revenues. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $14.5 million from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $38.1 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 10% in 2000 to 6% in 2001. The absolute increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the addition of Life Technologies in addition to new collaborative research and development projects and a $0.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 to write off software developed to operate high through put processing equipment that did not perform as expected. The software has no alternative future use. The decline as a percentage of revenues also reflects the impact of Life Technologies, whose historical percentage averaged 5% to 6% of revenues. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $32.9 million, or 8% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $5.0 million, or 2% of segment revenues. Excluding the fourth quarter write off of software and equipment, research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues trended downward on a quarterly basis during 2001 as we transitioned research and development positions from our Maryland facilities to California. During 2002 we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase on a quarterly basis as we continue to recruit and hire qualified scientists in California. Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. The increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets from $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $266.2 million for 2001 is due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Life Technologies and Dexter, which are amortized using the straight line method primarily over periods ranging from five to thirteen years. With the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, we expect that the elimination of goodwill amortization will have a positive impact on net income for the year ended December 31, 2002, of approximately $179.2 million, net of tax. The net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, will be reclassified 27 and reported as goodwill and will no longer be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Additionally, the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks assigned to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001, will no longer be amortized, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, due to its indefinite life. We expect to complete our initial review for impairment during the first quarter of 2002, and cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge, if any, will be recorded. Merger Costs. Merger costs for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $11.3 million and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $7.0 million in retention, severance and relocation costs as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California, $1.8 million in costs to exit distributor contracts, $1.6 million in business reorganization consulting fees and $0.7 million in product catalogue obsolescence. Due to the ongoing restructuring, additional merger costs associated with the integration are expected to be approximately $2.5 million during 2002 principally for retention costs. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $1.6 million from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $20.3 million for 2001 and was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during the year ended December 31, 2001, reduced by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.4 million from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $11.3 million in 2001, due mainly to interest on the 51/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 that were issued in March 2000 and the 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. Other Income, Net. Other income, net, increased $1.4 million to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2.9 million for 2000. The $4.3 million in 2001 is comprised mainly of $2.5 million in net periodic pension income from the Dexter Postretirement Health Benefit Program (which is overfunded), a $1.2 million gain on the sale of an electrophoresis product line acquired in the merger with Life Technologies, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in the Netherlands, a $0.4 million gain on the sale of our BioSepra business, reduced by $1.5 million in net foreign currency exchange losses. The net periodic pension income is recognized as other nonoperating income since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of the Company, but for which Invitrogen assumed liability at the time of the merger with Dexter. For 2002 the net periodic pension income is estimated to be $1.1 million lower than that recognized during 2001 due to the amortization of unrecognized losses. Income Tax Benefit (Provision). The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $9.3 million on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in the pre tax loss are certain merger related costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of these costs and expense, our effective tax rate was 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 35.3% for 2000. Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $153.3 million, or 165%, from $92.9 million in 1999 to $246.2 million for 2000. The acquisition of Life Technologies accounted for a significant portion of the increase in revenues and reflects revenues earned by Life Technologies subsequent to September 14, 2000, the date of acquisition. Due to the integration of our operations that began during the fourth quarter of 2000, the precise amount of the increase in revenues due to Life Technologies is not determinable. 28 Pro Forma Segment Revenues. Pro forma segment revenues presented in this discussion are based on the segment categorization used in 2000, which differs slightly from the 2001 categorization (see footnote 5 to the Business Segment Highlights table above). On an unaudited pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 1999, pro forma revenues for the year increased $50.4 million, or 10%, from $516.6 million in 1999 to $567.0 million in 2000. Pro forma segment revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $48.0 million, or 15%, from $318.7 million in 1999 to $366.7 million in 2000. Pro forma segment revenues for the Cell Culture segment increased $2.4 million, or 1%, from $197.9 million in 1999 to $200.3 million in 2000. Worldwide revenues, when reported in U.S. Dollars, were adversely affected by changes in currency rates in 2000. The change in currency rates accounted for a decrease in U.S. Dollar denominated revenues of $10.3 million, or 3%, for the pro forma Molecular Biology segment revenues and $8.2 million, or 4%, for the Cell Culture pro forma segment revenues. Holding currency conversion rates constant with those in 1999, Molecular Biology segment revenues increased 18%, Cell Culture segment revenues increased 5% and total combined revenues increased 13% for the year in 2000. The pro forma revenues exclude the businesses and operations of Dexter that were sold prior to the merger. These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the combinations been in effect on January 1, 1999, or of future results of operations. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased to 49% from 64% for the same period in 1999. Cost of sales in 2000 included the $16.6 million of merger related inventory valuation charges from the Life Technologies merger previously mentioned. Excluding this non cash incremental cost, gross margins were 56% in 2000. Consolidated gross margin for the periods after the merger with Life Technologies have been lower than Invitrogens consolidated gross margin before the merger principally because of the inclusion of lower margin products from the Life Technologies acquisition. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $30.1 million from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $46.4 million for 2000. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased from 18% to 19% for these periods. The addition of Life Technologies accounted for the majority of the absolute increase for 2000. Apart from the increase related to Life Technologies, the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues occurred as we increased our sales forces both in Europe and North America and implemented a new brand recognition program. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 increased $14.8 million from $12.0 million in 1999 to $26.8 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues for the same periods, general and administrative expenses decreased from 13% to 11%. The absolute increase resulted from the addition of Life Technologies along with continued expansion of administrative resources to support our growth and, during the first half of 2000, our requirements as a newly public company. The decline as a percentage of revenues occurred as a fixed portion of our general and administrative expenses was spread over a larger revenue base. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $8.7 million from $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $23.6 million for 2000. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 16% in 1999 to 10% in 2000. The absolute increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the addition of Life Technologies, new collaborative research and development projects and expanded research and development facilities. The decline as a percentage of revenues also reflects the impact of Life Technologies, whose historical percentage has averaged 5% to 6% of revenues. 29 Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. The increase in the amortization of intangible assets from $16,000 in 1999 to $81.6 million in 2000 is due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Life Technologies and Dexter, which are amortized using the straight line method primarily over periods ranging from five to thirteen years. Merger Costs. Merger costs represent net costs associated with the NOVEX, Research Genetics and Ethrog mergers that are expensed under the pooling method of accounting and totaled $6.3 million in 2000. Merger costs also include costs of $4.1 million associated with the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $16.7 million from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $18.7 million for 2000. The increase was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during the period. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $8.0 million from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $8.9 million for 2000 due mainly to interest on the 51/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 that were issued in March 2000. Other Income, Net. Other income, net, increased by $2.8 million from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $2.9 million for 2000 due to a gain on the sale of a product line of $1.9 million and net periodic pension income of $0.9 million from the Dexter Postretirement Health Benefit Program. Income Tax Benefit (Provision). The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $0.5 million, or 0.9%, of pre tax loss. This effective rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35% due mainly to certain merger related costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of these costs and expenses, our effective tax rate increased from 32.8% for 1999 to 35.3% for 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2000 compared to 1999 is attributable to a lower benefit from tax credits in 2000 and to a greater proportion of taxable income from Life Technologies operations arising in countries outside the U.S. that have, on average, statutory tax rates higher than the U.S. rate. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities provided net cash of $123.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Net cash from operating activities includes a net $36.8 million reduction in accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly from cash payments for accrued merger costs and accrued payroll taxes from stock option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2000. Net cash used in investing activities was $172.7 million, and reflects a net $193.0 million that was invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months, $7.3 million in cash paid for the remaining 20% ownership in the Companys Japanese subsidiary and capital expenditures and payments for intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties) during the year ended December 31, 2001, which totaled $44.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The net cash used for investment purposes was offset by $55.8 million in net proceeds from the sales of facilities, $11.6 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our BioSepra business and $10.3 million released from an escrow account acquired in the Dexter merger. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $518.0 million, and includes the $487.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and $30.3 million in net proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. We are seeking corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our molecular and cell culture platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. 30 For the year ending December 31, 2002, the Company expects spending for capital equipment and information technology to range from $40 million to $45 million, including $15 million to $20 million necessary to complete the build out of our new 320,000 square foot multi purpose facility in Carlsbad, California. Merger costs for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $11.3 million and were associated with the restructuring of existing Invitrogen operations and costs necessary to integrate the businesses of Invitrogen and Life Technologies. The Company estimates that approximately $2.5 million will be spent in 2002, principally for retention costs associated with the ongoing integration. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $17.3 million remaining in accrued merger and restructuring related costs that are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In May 2001, we sold our Rockville, Maryland facility and received $53.4 million in cash, net of closing costs. On July 31, 2001, the Company sold its BioSepra chromatography business for $13.6 million in cash, including $1.6 million in cash sold. At the date of these transactions, the Company did not recognize any gain or loss on these sales as the net assets sold were acquired in the Life Technologies merger and, in accordance with purchase accounting rules, the costs assigned to the net assets in the consolidated balance sheet were adjusted to fair market value. These adjustments, net of applicable taxes, were allocated to goodwill. Subsequent to September 2001, the end of the one year allocation period for goodwill, the Company received a $0.4 million payment upon finalization of the sale transaction and recorded this amount in other income in December 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded a reduction in our current tax liability of $20.7 million representing the tax benefit for non qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of our common stock by employees during the year. This benefit is reflected as additional paid in capital in the December 31, 2001, consolidated balance sheet. In December 2001, the Company issued $500 million principal amount of 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "21/4% Convertible Notes") due 2006. After expenses, the Company received net proceeds of $487.1 million. Interest on the 21/4% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 21/4% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 21/4% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Companys option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount. The Company had $172.5 million principal amount of 51/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "51/2% Convertible Notes") due 2007, outstanding at December 31, 2001. Interest on the 51/2% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on March 1st and September 1st. The 51/2% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 2.0 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $85.20 per share. The 51/2% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Companys option on or after March 1, 2003, at an initial premium of 103.143% of the principal amount. The premium declines annually to 100% of the principal amount of the notes at March 1, 2007. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the holders of the 21/4% Convertible Notes and the 51/2% Convertible Notes each have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2001, we had cash and cash equivalents of $878.2 million, short term investments of $99.6 million, long term investments of $93.9 million and working capital of $1.1 billion, excluding restricted cash and investments. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, demand notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury 31 obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2001, foreign subsidiaries in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. Dollar equivalent of these facilities total $4.8 million, of which $2.7 million was outstanding at December 31, 2001. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock buybacks, scientific progress in our research and development programs, the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting for Business Combinations. Since August of 1999, we have acquired three companies that have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting. To qualify for the pooling of interests method, criteria relating to the attributes of the combining companies prior to the combination, the manner of combining the companies and the absence of certain planned transactions after the combination must be met. Under the pooling of interests method, the value of the assets and liabilities of the combined companies are carried forward at their recorded amounts and the reported income for all periods prior to the combination are combined and restated as if the combination had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. If the criteria for pooling of interests accounting treatment are not met, then the purchase method of accounting would be applied. Under the purchase method of accounting all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their fair values at the date of the acquisition and results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. If we were to account for these three acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting rather than the pooling of interests method of accounting, it would result in materially different reported results. A reconciliation of previously reported results by these three companies to the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements is provided in Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. In cases where customers order and pay for large batches of cell culture products and request that we store a portion of the batch for them, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. The Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition," ("SAB 101") provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. We believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with this guidance and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. We recognize royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. 32 Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivable balance was $92.1 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.3 million at December 31, 2001. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Inventories were stated at $80.6 million at December 31, 2001. Valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. If a change were to 33 occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS No. 142) "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" became effective and as a result, we will cease to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. We expect that the elimination of goodwill and indefinite lived amortization will have a positive impact on net income for the year ended December 31, 2002, of approximately $179.2 million, net of tax. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter. We expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of 2002, and cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge, if any, will be recorded. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," and EITF Issue 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $17.3 million at December 31, 2001 and we expect to incur an additional $2.5 million during 2002, which has not been accrued for or recognized in the statement of operations as the costs do not meet the recognition criteria of EITF 94 3 as of December 31, 2001. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves were $12.4 million at December 31, 2001 Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these 34 plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our consolidated balance sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Valuation of deferred income taxes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets and cash and cash equivalents which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We are evaluating the feasibility and usefulness of assigning our other assets to the Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments and may report assets by segment in the future. We also do not report product line information as it would be impracticable to do so. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), "Business Combinations," and Statement No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses the accounting for acquisitions of businesses and is effective for acquisitions occurring on or after July 1, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination, eliminates further amortization of goodwill, and requires periodic evaluations of impairment of goodwill balances. In addition, the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired in transactions completed before July 1, 2001 are to be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods adjusted accordingly. SFAS No. 142 is effective January 1, 2002. The net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, will be reclassified and reported as goodwill and will no longer be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Additionally, the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks assigned to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001, will no longer be amortized, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, due to its indefinite life. Based on the current values assigned to goodwill, assembled workforce and the GIBCO tradename, we expect that the elimination of goodwill amortization and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization will have a positive impact on reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 of approximately $179.2 million, net of tax. We expect to complete our initial review for impairment during the first quarter of 2002, and cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge will be recorded. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 replaces Statement No. 121 and provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 for the disposal of segments of a business and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The statement creates one 35 accounting model, based on the framework established in Statement No. 121, to be applied to all long lived assets including discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 is effective January 1, 2002. We are currently assessing the impacts of adoption of SFAS No. 144 and have not yet determined the impact of this Statement on our consolidated financial statements. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. Dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. Dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $629.3 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the prior year ended December 31, 2000 to our non U.S. revenues for 2001 results in revenues of $645.5 million. Therefore, as a result of the change in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, our 2001 revenues reported in U.S. Dollars were negatively affected by $16.2 million. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. To assist investors with the comparisons of our underlying business between currently reported periods, we have provided our revenue and growth rate results on a foreign currency comparable basis. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is at risk subject to changes in exchange rates as they may be worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses in the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the value of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange losses recognized on business transactions, net of 36 hedging transactions, were $1.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We currently use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on non functional currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2001, we had $3.5 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which settle on various dates through February 2002, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. We currently do not enter into financial contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk on anticipated or forecasted transactions. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, our cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in securities with maturities of less than three months and, as a result, the fair value of these securities approximated carrying value due to their short term nature. In addition, it is currently our intent to hold all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities until maturity, and, accordingly, their carrying values are not adjusted for changes in fair value. Thus, any potential changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates would not affect our financial position or results of operations. We would, however, be at risk for lower earnings should interest rates decline. ISSUES RELATED TO THE EUROPEAN MONETARY CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, certain member states of the European Economic Community (EEC) fixed their respective currencies to a new currency, the Euro. On that day, the Euro became a functional legal currency within these countries. During the three years beginning on January 1, 1999, business in these EEC member states were conducted in both the Euro and the existing national currency, such as the Netherlands Guilder, French Franc or Deutsche Mark. Businesses were required to complete transition to the Euro and begin reporting and conducting their transactions in the Euro by January 1, 2002. On July 1, 2002, the existing national currencies will be withdrawn and will no longer be considered legal tender. Companies operating in or conducting business in EEC member states need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the existing currencies, as well as the Euro. During the third quarter of 2001, we successfully implemented the Euro compliant version of our European software system, and the conversion of the currencies was completed in December 2001 in accordance with European Union requirements. The cost to upgrade the software was $0.3 million. To date we have spent immaterial amounts to comply with these statutory requirements. These assessments have not been independently verified. Also, we have not determined the costs related to any problems that may arise in the future due to the inability of any of our customers or vendors to comply with the statutory requirements. Any such problems may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We develop, manufacture, and market products for the life sciences markets. Our products are principally research tools in reagent and kit form, biochemicals, sera, media and other products and services that we sell to corporate, government, and academic entities. We focus our business on two principal segments: Molecular Biology. We are a leading supplier of research kits that simplify and improve gene cloning, gene expression, and gene analysis techniques. We also supply a full range of related molecular biology products including enzymes, nucleic acids and other biochemicals and reagents. 21 Cell Culture. We are also a leading supplier of sera, cell and tissue culture media and reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce pharmaceuticals and other materials made by cultured cells. Our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture products are used for research purposes, and, their use by our customers is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our Cell Culture Products and manufacturing sites are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations (formerly known as current good manufacturing practice, or "GMP") described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Carlsbad and San Diego, California; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Inchinnan, Scotland; and Huntsville, Alabama. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We also have manufacturing facilities in Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Brazil, and Israel. We sell our products throughout the world via subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries. The majority of our sales activities are conducted through a dedicated direct sales organization located in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We also conduct marketing and distribution activities through our subsidiaries. Additionally, we sell through international distributors who resell Invitrogen kits and products. These distributors are located primarily in selected territories in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia. We may choose in the future to establish a direct sales organization in these and additional territories. We conduct research activities in the United States and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Our revenues have increased significantly since our inception. The increase in our revenues has been due to several factors, including acquisitions, the continued growth of the market for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis kits, cell culture products and other products and related services; increasing market acceptance of these kits and products; our introduction of new research kits and products for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis; and the expansion of our direct sales and marketing efforts. We plan to continue to introduce new research kits, as we believe continued new product development and rapid product introduction is a critical competitive factor in the market for molecular biology research kits. To support increased levels of sales and to augment our long term competitive position, we may increase expenditures in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, although we are continuing to streamline our operations in an effort to realize cost savings following the Life Technologies merger. Except for our oligonucleotide and services businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We have acquired a significant number of licenses to use patented technologies from third parties as part of our business activities. We use these licenses as a basis for the development of many of our research kits and other products. We pay royalties to such third parties relating to sales of these research kits, other products and selected services. Royalty expense is recognized as a cost of revenue as the related royalties are incurred. 22 On September 14, 2000, we completed our mergers with Life Technologies and Dexter. Substantially all of the businesses and operations of Dexter were sold prior to the closing of the mergers. Both transactions have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which significantly affects the comparability of the financial information presented. On June 21, 2000, February 2, 2000, and August 17, 1999, we completed our acquisitions of Ethrog, Research Genetics and NOVEX, respectively. These transactions have been accounted for as pooling of interests, and the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined financial and operating results of Invitrogen, Ethrog, Research Genetics and NOVEX. Effective in the first quarter of 2001, we reorganized into two lines of business, a Molecular Biology segment and a Cell Culture segment and are reporting results by segment for 2001. Segment financial information for Molecular Biology and Cell Culture prior to 2001 has not been provided, as it would be impracticable to do so. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the dominant currency in the respective country of residence of the subsidiary. The translation from the functional currency to the U.S. Dollar for revenue and expenses is based on the average exchange rate during the period. Large increases or decreases in the spread between currencies have affected and may continue to affect our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, and income or losses. Certain of our subsidiaries also conduct their business in the currencies of their significant customers. Exchange gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. Large increases or decreases in these currency fluctuations could also have an impact on our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and income or losses. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results." In addition, our results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors and the mix of sales among distributors and our direct sales force. Although we have experienced growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain revenue growth or become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis or that our growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts. 23  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Business Segment Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2001. Molecular Biology Cell Culture Corporate And Unallocated(1) Total (In Thousands) Segment Results Revenues from external customers $ 414,241 $ 215,049 $ $ 629,290 Gross margin $ 251,780 $ 94,485 $ (2,677 ) $ 343,588 Gross margin as a percentage of revenues 61 % 44 % 55 % Selling, administrative and R&D 156,051 45,242 15,356 216,649 Merger related amortization and costs 277,547 277,547 Income (loss) from operations $ 95,729 $ 49,243 $ (295,580 ) $ (150,608 ) Operating margin as a percentage of revenues 23 % 23 % Pro forma Revenue Growth (unaudited) Revenues for the year 2001 $ 414,241 $ 215,049 $ 629,290 Adjust for effect of foreign exchange rates(2) 9,764 6,469 16,233 Currency adjusted revenues $ 424,005 $ 221,518 $ 645,523 Revenues for the year 2001 $ 414,241 $ 215,049 $ 629,290 Less revenues from discontinued products(3) (12,091 ) (29,859 ) (41,950 ) Revenues from continuing products 402,150 185,190 587,340 Adjust for effect of foreign exchange rates on continuing products(2) 9,269 5,268 14,537 Currency adjusted revenues from continuing products $ 411,419 $ 190,458 $ 601,877 Pro forma revenues for the year 2000(4) $ 365,683 (5) $ 201,294 (5) $ 566,977 Less revenues from discontinued products(4) (28,565 ) (36,345 ) (64,910 ) Pro forma revenues from continuing products(4) $ 337,118 $ 164,949 $ 502,067 Revenue growth for the year 2001 13 % 7 % 11 % Currency adjusted revenue growth 16 % 10 % 14 % Revenue growth for continuing products 19 % 12 % 17 % Currency adjusted revenue growth for continuing products 22 % 15 % 20 % (1)Unallocated items for the year ended December 31, 2001 include costs for purchase accounting inventory revaluations of $2.6 million, amortization of deferred compensation of $2.2 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of $266.2 million and merger costs of $11.3 million which are not allocated by management for purposes of analyzing the operations since they are principally non cash items resulting primarily from purchase accounting as well as company wide restructuring activities. (2)Changes in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in the prior year affected dollar denominated revenues. These adjustments are to arrive at dollar denominated revenues assuming foreign exchange rates that are constant with those during the comparable period of last year. (3)Subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. 24 (4)Pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, are provided on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. (5)2001 presentation of 2000 revenues by segment reflects a $1.0 million reallocation of revenues between segments due to changes in segment categorization of certain products. Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $383.1 million, or 156%, from $246.2 million in 2000 to $629.3 million for 2001. The acquisition of Life Technologies accounted for a significant portion of the increase in revenues. Due to the integration of our operations that began during the fourth quarter of 2000, the precise amount of the increase in revenues due to Life Technologies is not determinable. Additionally, subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Pro Forma and Segment Revenues. Pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, are provided on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. The pro forma revenues reported for 2000 by segment have been reallocated to conform to the segment classifications used in 2001. We have also provided revenue comparisons below on a foreign currency constant basis, in order to clarify for investors the changes in our revenues that are unrelated to foreign currency exchange effects. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased $62.3 million, or 11%, from pro forma revenues of $567.0 million in 2000 to $629.3 million in 2001. Changes in foreign exchange rates when comparing the year ended December 31, 2001, with the pro forma year of 2000 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $16.2 million. Holding foreign exchange rates constant with those during the year ended December 31, 2000 revenues during 2001 would have been $645.5 million, an increase of 14% from pro forma 2000 revenues. Molecular Biology Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $48.6 million, or 13%, from pro forma segment revenues of $365.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $414.2 million in 2001. The $414.2 million of Molecular Biology revenues in 2001 is comprised of $402.1 million of continuing products and $12.1 million of discontinued products. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign exchange rates reduced dollar denominated Molecular Biology revenues by $9.8 million when comparing 2001 with pro forma revenues of 2000. Holding foreign exchange rates constant with 2000, sales of continuing Molecular Biology products increased 22% from pro forma 2000 revenues. The 22% increase reflects primarily the continued growth of the market for product lines including cloning & gene expression, separation & analysis and amplification products, which increased 24% in 2001 on a currency comparable basis. Other product lines, including oligonucleotides, custom services, licensing and royalties, increased 13% on a currency comparable basis for the year ended December 31, 2001. On February 28, 2002, we announced that we are experiencing softness in our molecular biology segment. We believe the softness is attributable to several causes. For example, revenue from the sale of oligonucleotides and custom services is showing weakness. In addition, currency comparable revenue growth from molecular biology products, including cloning and expression, amplification and separation and analysis products is tracking at a 17% rate of growth for the first quarter of 2002 versus 23% for the fourth quarter of 2001. We have taken steps to address the softness in the molecular biology segment. For example, we have increased our manufacturing capacity for oligonucleotides, and we expect to increase our product offerings for custom services, including providing more full length clones and open open reading frames. However, if revenue for oligonucleotides and custom services continues to show weakness, or if revenue growth for molecular biology products continues at the reduced rate and is not offset by additional growth in other areas of our business, this could result in a negative impact on our revenue for 2002. In addition, the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese 25 Yen and the Euro, recently has declined against the U.S. Dollar. If these currencies remain at their current levels for all of 2002, reported revenue on sales made in these currencies will decrease and result in a negative impact on our revenue for 2002. Cell Culture Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Cell Culture segment for the year ended December 31 increased $13.8 million, or 7%, from pro forma segment revenues of $201.3 million in 2000 to $215.0 million in 2001. The $215.0 million of Cell Culture revenues in 2001 is comprised of $185.2 million of continuing products and $29.9 million of discontinued products, which includes revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign exchange rates during 2001 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $6.5 million. Holding foreign exchange rates constant with 2000, sales of continuing Cell Culture products increased 15% from pro forma 2000 revenues. This increase reflects sales of Cell Culture products for large scale production applications that increased 32% in 2001 on a currency comparable basis. These unaudited pro forma results for our two business segments have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the combinations been in effect on January 1, 2000, or of future results of operations. We expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, the continuing integration of Life Technologies in addition to new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets and U.S. government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, product discontinuations and foreign currency rates. If the recent decline of certain currencies, including the Japanese Yen and the Euro, against the U.S. Dollar remain at their current levels for all of 2002, reported revenue on sales made in these currencies will decrease and could result in a material negative impact on our revenue for 2002. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 55% compared with 49% for the same period in 2000. Cost of sales in 2000 included $16.6 million of merger related inventory valuation charges from the Life Technologies merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, inventories acquired in the merger are recorded at their fair value, which generally requires a non cash write up to estimated selling prices less the cost to sell or dispose of the inventory. Subsequent sales of this inventory result in costs of sales that are generally higher than our manufactured inventory, which is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Excluding this non cash incremental cost, gross margin was 56% in 2000. Consolidated gross margin for the periods after the merger with Life Technologies have been lower than Invitrogens consolidated gross margin before the merger principally because of the inclusion of lower margin products from the Life Technologies business. The Company has instituted various programs to improve gross margins since the Life Technologies merger, including cost reductions, price adjustments and the discontinuation or sale of lower margin product lines. Gross margins have improved since the fourth quarter of 2000, which was the first full quarter of combined company results. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2000 was 51%, excluding the merger related inventory valuation charges of $12.3 million recognized during that period. Gross margin for the Molecular Biology segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 61% and for the Cell Culture segment was 44%. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the continuing integration of Life Technologies in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, and foreign currency rates. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $66.5 million from $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $112.8 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 19% in 2000 to 18% in 2001. The reduction as a percentage of 26 revenues resulted from the addition of the Cell Culture segment from the Life Technologies merger which has a lower ratio of sales and marketing costs to revenues and to the closure of a distribution facility in the Netherlands. Additionally, 2000 included costs incurred for a new brand recognition program. The addition of Life Technologies accounted for the majority of the absolute increase for 2001. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $84.0 million, or 20% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $28.4 million, or 13% of segment revenues. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 increased $38.9 million from $26.8 million in 2000 to $65.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 11% in 2000 to 10% in 2001. The absolute increase during 2001 resulted from the addition of Life Technologies, higher legal costs for ongoing litigation to protect our patents, duplicate staffing at our Rockville and Carlsbad sites as we transitioned employees and functions to Carlsbad and continued expansion of administrative resources to support our growth. The decrease as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, occurred primarily because a fixed portion of our general and administrative expense was spread over a larger revenue base. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the Molecular Biology segment were $39.2 million, or 9% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $11.9 million, or 6% of segment revenues. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $14.5 million from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $38.1 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 10% in 2000 to 6% in 2001. The absolute increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the addition of Life Technologies in addition to new collaborative research and development projects and a $0.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 to write off software developed to operate high through put processing equipment that did not perform as expected. The software has no alternative future use. The decline as a percentage of revenues also reflects the impact of Life Technologies, whose historical percentage averaged 5% to 6% of revenues. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $32.9 million, or 8% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $5.0 million, or 2% of segment revenues. Excluding the fourth quarter write off of software and equipment, research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues trended downward on a quarterly basis during 2001 as we transitioned research and development positions from our Maryland facilities to California. During 2002 we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase on a quarterly basis as we continue to recruit and hire qualified scientists in California. Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. The increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets from $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $266.2 million for 2001 is due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Life Technologies and Dexter, which are amortized using the straight line method primarily over periods ranging from five to thirteen years. With the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, we expect that the elimination of goodwill amortization will have a positive impact on net income for the year ended December 31, 2002, of approximately $179.2 million, net of tax. The net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, will be reclassified 27 and reported as goodwill and will no longer be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Additionally, the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks assigned to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001, will no longer be amortized, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, due to its indefinite life. We expect to complete our initial review for impairment during the first quarter of 2002, and cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge, if any, will be recorded. Merger Costs. Merger costs for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $11.3 million and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $7.0 million in retention, severance and relocation costs as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California, $1.8 million in costs to exit distributor contracts, $1.6 million in business reorganization consulting fees and $0.7 million in product catalogue obsolescence. Due to the ongoing restructuring, additional merger costs associated with the integration are expected to be approximately $2.5 million during 2002 principally for retention costs. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $1.6 million from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $20.3 million for 2001 and was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during the year ended December 31, 2001, reduced by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.4 million from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $11.3 million in 2001, due mainly to interest on the 51/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 that were issued in March 2000 and the 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. Other Income, Net. Other income, net, increased $1.4 million to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2.9 million for 2000. The $4.3 million in 2001 is comprised mainly of $2.5 million in net periodic pension income from the Dexter Postretirement Health Benefit Program (which is overfunded), a $1.2 million gain on the sale of an electrophoresis product line acquired in the merger with Life Technologies, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in the Netherlands, a $0.4 million gain on the sale of our BioSepra business, reduced by $1.5 million in net foreign currency exchange losses. The net periodic pension income is recognized as other nonoperating income since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of the Company, but for which Invitrogen assumed liability at the time of the merger with Dexter. For 2002 the net periodic pension income is estimated to be $1.1 million lower than that recognized during 2001 due to the amortization of unrecognized losses. Income Tax Benefit (Provision). The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $9.3 million on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in the pre tax loss are certain merger related costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of these costs and expense, our effective tax rate was 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 35.3% for 2000. Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $153.3 million, or 165%, from $92.9 million in 1999 to $246.2 million for 2000. The acquisition of Life Technologies accounted for a significant portion of the increase in revenues and reflects revenues earned by Life Technologies subsequent to September 14, 2000, the date of acquisition. Due to the integration of our operations that began during the fourth quarter of 2000, the precise amount of the increase in revenues due to Life Technologies is not determinable. 28 Pro Forma Segment Revenues. Pro forma segment revenues presented in this discussion are based on the segment categorization used in 2000, which differs slightly from the 2001 categorization (see footnote 5 to the Business Segment Highlights table above). On an unaudited pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 1999, pro forma revenues for the year increased $50.4 million, or 10%, from $516.6 million in 1999 to $567.0 million in 2000. Pro forma segment revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $48.0 million, or 15%, from $318.7 million in 1999 to $366.7 million in 2000. Pro forma segment revenues for the Cell Culture segment increased $2.4 million, or 1%, from $197.9 million in 1999 to $200.3 million in 2000. Worldwide revenues, when reported in U.S. Dollars, were adversely affected by changes in currency rates in 2000. The change in currency rates accounted for a decrease in U.S. Dollar denominated revenues of $10.3 million, or 3%, for the pro forma Molecular Biology segment revenues and $8.2 million, or 4%, for the Cell Culture pro forma segment revenues. Holding currency conversion rates constant with those in 1999, Molecular Biology segment revenues increased 18%, Cell Culture segment revenues increased 5% and total combined revenues increased 13% for the year in 2000. The pro forma revenues exclude the businesses and operations of Dexter that were sold prior to the merger. These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the combinations been in effect on January 1, 1999, or of future results of operations. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 decreased to 49% from 64% for the same period in 1999. Cost of sales in 2000 included the $16.6 million of merger related inventory valuation charges from the Life Technologies merger previously mentioned. Excluding this non cash incremental cost, gross margins were 56% in 2000. Consolidated gross margin for the periods after the merger with Life Technologies have been lower than Invitrogens consolidated gross margin before the merger principally because of the inclusion of lower margin products from the Life Technologies acquisition. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $30.1 million from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $46.4 million for 2000. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased from 18% to 19% for these periods. The addition of Life Technologies accounted for the majority of the absolute increase for 2000. Apart from the increase related to Life Technologies, the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues occurred as we increased our sales forces both in Europe and North America and implemented a new brand recognition program. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 increased $14.8 million from $12.0 million in 1999 to $26.8 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues for the same periods, general and administrative expenses decreased from 13% to 11%. The absolute increase resulted from the addition of Life Technologies along with continued expansion of administrative resources to support our growth and, during the first half of 2000, our requirements as a newly public company. The decline as a percentage of revenues occurred as a fixed portion of our general and administrative expenses was spread over a larger revenue base. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $8.7 million from $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $23.6 million for 2000. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 16% in 1999 to 10% in 2000. The absolute increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the addition of Life Technologies, new collaborative research and development projects and expanded research and development facilities. The decline as a percentage of revenues also reflects the impact of Life Technologies, whose historical percentage has averaged 5% to 6% of revenues. 29 Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. The increase in the amortization of intangible assets from $16,000 in 1999 to $81.6 million in 2000 is due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Life Technologies and Dexter, which are amortized using the straight line method primarily over periods ranging from five to thirteen years. Merger Costs. Merger costs represent net costs associated with the NOVEX, Research Genetics and Ethrog mergers that are expensed under the pooling method of accounting and totaled $6.3 million in 2000. Merger costs also include costs of $4.1 million associated with the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $16.7 million from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $18.7 million for 2000. The increase was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during the period. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $8.0 million from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $8.9 million for 2000 due mainly to interest on the 51/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 that were issued in March 2000. Other Income, Net. Other income, net, increased by $2.8 million from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, to $2.9 million for 2000 due to a gain on the sale of a product line of $1.9 million and net periodic pension income of $0.9 million from the Dexter Postretirement Health Benefit Program. Income Tax Benefit (Provision). The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $0.5 million, or 0.9%, of pre tax loss. This effective rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 35% due mainly to certain merger related costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of these costs and expenses, our effective tax rate increased from 32.8% for 1999 to 35.3% for 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2000 compared to 1999 is attributable to a lower benefit from tax credits in 2000 and to a greater proportion of taxable income from Life Technologies operations arising in countries outside the U.S. that have, on average, statutory tax rates higher than the U.S. rate. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities provided net cash of $123.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Net cash from operating activities includes a net $36.8 million reduction in accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly from cash payments for accrued merger costs and accrued payroll taxes from stock option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2000. Net cash used in investing activities was $172.7 million, and reflects a net $193.0 million that was invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months, $7.3 million in cash paid for the remaining 20% ownership in the Companys Japanese subsidiary and capital expenditures and payments for intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties) during the year ended December 31, 2001, which totaled $44.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The net cash used for investment purposes was offset by $55.8 million in net proceeds from the sales of facilities, $11.6 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our BioSepra business and $10.3 million released from an escrow account acquired in the Dexter merger. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $518.0 million, and includes the $487.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and $30.3 million in net proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. We are seeking corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our molecular and cell culture platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. 30 For the year ending December 31, 2002, the Company expects spending for capital equipment and information technology to range from $40 million to $45 million, including $15 million to $20 million necessary to complete the build out of our new 320,000 square foot multi purpose facility in Carlsbad, California. Merger costs for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $11.3 million and were associated with the restructuring of existing Invitrogen operations and costs necessary to integrate the businesses of Invitrogen and Life Technologies. The Company estimates that approximately $2.5 million will be spent in 2002, principally for retention costs associated with the ongoing integration. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $17.3 million remaining in accrued merger and restructuring related costs that are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In May 2001, we sold our Rockville, Maryland facility and received $53.4 million in cash, net of closing costs. On July 31, 2001, the Company sold its BioSepra chromatography business for $13.6 million in cash, including $1.6 million in cash sold. At the date of these transactions, the Company did not recognize any gain or loss on these sales as the net assets sold were acquired in the Life Technologies merger and, in accordance with purchase accounting rules, the costs assigned to the net assets in the consolidated balance sheet were adjusted to fair market value. These adjustments, net of applicable taxes, were allocated to goodwill. Subsequent to September 2001, the end of the one year allocation period for goodwill, the Company received a $0.4 million payment upon finalization of the sale transaction and recorded this amount in other income in December 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded a reduction in our current tax liability of $20.7 million representing the tax benefit for non qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of our common stock by employees during the year. This benefit is reflected as additional paid in capital in the December 31, 2001, consolidated balance sheet. In December 2001, the Company issued $500 million principal amount of 21/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "21/4% Convertible Notes") due 2006. After expenses, the Company received net proceeds of $487.1 million. Interest on the 21/4% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 21/4% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 21/4% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Companys option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount. The Company had $172.5 million principal amount of 51/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "51/2% Convertible Notes") due 2007, outstanding at December 31, 2001. Interest on the 51/2% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on March 1st and September 1st. The 51/2% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 2.0 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $85.20 per share. The 51/2% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Companys option on or after March 1, 2003, at an initial premium of 103.143% of the principal amount. The premium declines annually to 100% of the principal amount of the notes at March 1, 2007. In the event of a change of control of the Company, the holders of the 21/4% Convertible Notes and the 51/2% Convertible Notes each have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2001, we had cash and cash equivalents of $878.2 million, short term investments of $99.6 million, long term investments of $93.9 million and working capital of $1.1 billion, excluding restricted cash and investments. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, demand notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury 31 obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2001, foreign subsidiaries in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. Dollar equivalent of these facilities total $4.8 million, of which $2.7 million was outstanding at December 31, 2001. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock buybacks, scientific progress in our research and development programs, the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting for Business Combinations. Since August of 1999, we have acquired three companies that have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting. To qualify for the pooling of interests method, criteria relating to the attributes of the combining companies prior to the combination, the manner of combining the companies and the absence of certain planned transactions after the combination must be met. Under the pooling of interests method, the value of the assets and liabilities of the combined companies are carried forward at their recorded amounts and the reported income for all periods prior to the combination are combined and restated as if the combination had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. If the criteria for pooling of interests accounting treatment are not met, then the purchase method of accounting would be applied. Under the purchase method of accounting all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their fair values at the date of the acquisition and results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. If we were to account for these three acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting rather than the pooling of interests method of accounting, it would result in materially different reported results. A reconciliation of previously reported results by these three companies to the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements is provided in Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. In cases where customers order and pay for large batches of cell culture products and request that we store a portion of the batch for them, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. The Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition," ("SAB 101") provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. We believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with this guidance and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. We recognize royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. 32 Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivable balance was $92.1 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.3 million at December 31, 2001. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Inventories were stated at $80.6 million at December 31, 2001. Valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. If a change were to 33 occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS No. 142) "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" became effective and as a result, we will cease to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. We expect that the elimination of goodwill and indefinite lived amortization will have a positive impact on net income for the year ended December 31, 2002, of approximately $179.2 million, net of tax. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter. We expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of 2002, and cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge, if any, will be recorded. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," and EITF Issue 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $17.3 million at December 31, 2001 and we expect to incur an additional $2.5 million during 2002, which has not been accrued for or recognized in the statement of operations as the costs do not meet the recognition criteria of EITF 94 3 as of December 31, 2001. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves were $12.4 million at December 31, 2001 Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these 34 plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our consolidated balance sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Valuation of deferred income taxes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets and cash and cash equivalents which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We are evaluating the feasibility and usefulness of assigning our other assets to the Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments and may report assets by segment in the future. We also do not report product line information as it would be impracticable to do so. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), "Business Combinations," and Statement No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses the accounting for acquisitions of businesses and is effective for acquisitions occurring on or after July 1, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination, eliminates further amortization of goodwill, and requires periodic evaluations of impairment of goodwill balances. In addition, the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired in transactions completed before July 1, 2001 are to be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods adjusted accordingly. SFAS No. 142 is effective January 1, 2002. The net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, will be reclassified and reported as goodwill and will no longer be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Additionally, the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks assigned to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001, will no longer be amortized, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, due to its indefinite life. Based on the current values assigned to goodwill, assembled workforce and the GIBCO tradename, we expect that the elimination of goodwill amortization and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization will have a positive impact on reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 of approximately $179.2 million, net of tax. We expect to complete our initial review for impairment during the first quarter of 2002, and cannot predict at this time whether a material impairment charge will be recorded. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 replaces Statement No. 121 and provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 for the disposal of segments of a business and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The statement creates one 35 accounting model, based on the framework established in Statement No. 121, to be applied to all long lived assets including discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 is effective January 1, 2002. We are currently assessing the impacts of adoption of SFAS No. 144 and have not yet determined the impact of this Statement on our consolidated financial statements. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. Dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. Dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $629.3 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the prior year ended December 31, 2000 to our non U.S. revenues for 2001 results in revenues of $645.5 million. Therefore, as a result of the change in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, our 2001 revenues reported in U.S. Dollars were negatively affected by $16.2 million. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. To assist investors with the comparisons of our underlying business between currently reported periods, we have provided our revenue and growth rate results on a foreign currency comparable basis. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is at risk subject to changes in exchange rates as they may be worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses in the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the value of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange losses recognized on business transactions, net of 36 hedging transactions, were $1.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We currently use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on non functional currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2001, we had $3.5 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which settle on various dates through February 2002, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. We currently do not enter into financial contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk on anticipated or forecasted transactions. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, our cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in securities with maturities of less than three months and, as a result, the fair value of these securities approximated carrying value due to their short term nature. In addition, it is currently our intent to hold all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities until maturity, and, accordingly, their carrying values are not adjusted for changes in fair value. Thus, any potential changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates would not affect our financial position or results of operations. We would, however, be at risk for lower earnings should interest rates decline. ISSUES RELATED TO THE EUROPEAN MONETARY CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, certain member states of the European Economic Community (EEC) fixed their respective currencies to a new currency, the Euro. On that day, the Euro became a functional legal currency within these countries. During the three years beginning on January 1, 1999, business in these EEC member states were conducted in both the Euro and the existing national currency, such as the Netherlands Guilder, French Franc or Deutsche Mark. Businesses were required to complete transition to the Euro and begin reporting and conducting their transactions in the Euro by January 1, 2002. On July 1, 2002, the existing national currencies will be withdrawn and will no longer be considered legal tender. Companies operating in or conducting business in EEC member states need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the existing currencies, as well as the Euro. During the third quarter of 2001, we successfully implemented the Euro compliant version of our European software system, and the conversion of the currencies was completed in December 2001 in accordance with European Union requirements. The cost to upgrade the software was $0.3 million. To date we have spent immaterial amounts to comply with these statutory requirements. These assessments have not been independently verified. Also, we have not determined the costs related to any problems that may arise in the future due to the inability of any of our customers or vendors to comply with the statutory requirements. Any such problems may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  ITEM 7A.
