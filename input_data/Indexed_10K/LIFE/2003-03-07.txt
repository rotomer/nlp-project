Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We develop, manufacture, and market products for the life sciences markets. Our products are principally research tools in reagent and kit form, biochemicals, sera, media and other products and services that we sell to corporate, government, and academic entities. We focus our business on two principal segments: Molecular Biology. We are a leading supplier of research kits that simplify and improve gene cloning, gene expression, and gene analysis techniques. We also supply a full range of related molecular biology products including enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents, and informatics software. Cell Culture. We are also a leading supplier of sera, cell and tissue culture media and reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce pharmaceuticals and other materials made by cultured cells. Our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture products are used for research purposes, and their use by our customers is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our Cell Culture products and manufacturing sites are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations, which was formerly known as current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, and is described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Carlsbad, California; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; and Inchinnan, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We sell our products throughout the world via subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries. The majority of our sales activities are conducted through a dedicated direct sales organization located in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We also conduct marketing and distribution activities through our subsidiaries. Additionally, we sell through international distributors who resell Invitrogen kits and products. These distributors are located primarily in selected territories in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia. We may choose in the future to establish a direct sales organization in these and additional territories. We conduct research activities in the United States and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Our revenues have increased significantly since our inception. The increase in our revenues has been due to several factors: acquisitions; the continued growth of the market for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis kits, cell culture products and other products and related services; increasing market acceptance of these kits and products; our introduction of new research kits and products for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis; our ability to increase prices; and the expansion of our direct sales and marketing efforts. We plan to continue to introduce new research kits, as we believe continued new product development and rapid product introduction is a critical competitive factor in the market for molecular biology research kits. We may also continue to grow our business through acquisitions. To support increased levels of sales and to augment our long term competitive position, we may increase expenditures in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development. Except for our oligonucleotide, genomics services and cell culture production businesses, which are made to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We have acquired a significant number of licenses to use patented technologies from third parties as part of our business activities. We use these licenses as a basis for the development of many of our 24 Table of Contents research kits and other products. We pay royalties to third parties on sales of these research kits, other products and selected services. We recognize royalty expense as a cost of revenue as we incur the related royalties. On December 6, 2002, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of InforMax, Inc., a provider of a multi application suite of data access, analysis and presentation software for life science applications. The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase, and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. On September 14, 2000, we completed our mergers with Life Technologies and Dexter. Substantially all of the businesses and operations of Dexter, other than Life Technologies, were sold prior to the closing of the mergers. Both transactions have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which significantly affects the comparability of the financial information presented. On June 21, 2000, and February 2, 2000, we completed our acquisitions of Ethrog and Research Genetics, respectively. These transactions have been accounted for as pooling of interests, and the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined financial and operating results of Invitrogen, Ethrog and Research Genetics. In 2001, as a result of our acquisition of Life Technologies, we reorganized into two lines of business, a Molecular Biology segment and a Cell Culture segment and are reporting results by segment for 2002 and 2001. Other than the pro forma revenue information as set forth on pages 30 and 31, segment financial information for Molecular Biology and Cell Culture prior to 2001 has not been provided, as it would be impracticable to do so. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and may continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors that may Affect Future Results. In addition, our results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors, the mix of sales among distributors and our direct sales force. Although we have experienced growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that our growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts. 25 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Business Segment Highlights for the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

(2) 2002 presentation of 2001 revenues and gross margin by segment reflects reclassifications of revenues and gross margin between segments due to changes in segment categorization of certain products. (3) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the same period in the prior year affected dollar denominated revenues. These adjustments are to arrive at dollar denominated revenues 26 Table of Contents assuming foreign currency exchange rates that are constant with those during the comparable period of last year. (4) Subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Revenues. In addition to our analysis of changes in reported revenues, we have also provided revenue comparisons on a foreign currency constant basis, to clarify the changes in our revenues that are unrelated to foreign currency translation effects. We have also reclassified revenues by segment reported for 2001 to conform to the segment classifications used in 2002. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $19.3 million, or 3%, from $629.3 million in 2001 to $648.6 million for 2002. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2002, with 2001, increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $4.5 million of the $19.3 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates also increased our revenue growth rate by 1%. Subsequent to the merger with Life Technologies that occurred in September 2000, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Sales of these products were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, down from $42.0 million for 2001. Revenues from continuing products for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 9% from 2001, when holding foreign currency exchange rates constant. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the British Pound sterling and the Euro, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to foreign currency rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price changes, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. Molecular Biology Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $19.5 million, or 5%, from $409.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $428.9 million in 2002. The $428.9 million of Molecular Biology revenues in 2002 includes $3.2 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $12.1 million sold in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased dollar denominated Molecular Biology revenues by $2.7 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2002 with the same period in 2001. The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of Molecular Biology products during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 6% from 2001 revenues. Sales of our cloning and gene expression, separation and analysis, and amplification products lines, increased 15% during the year ended December 31, 2002 from 2001. Revenues from our other molecular biology product lines, including oligonucleotides, custom services, licensing and royalties, for the year ended December 31, 2002 were 28% lower than such revenues in 2001. Sales growth for our cloning and gene expression, separations and analysis, and amplification product lines, slowed during this year to a 15% revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, the sales growth rate for these products slowed to 11% in the fourth quarter of 2002. Currently, we expect our revenue growth rate for this portion of our business for 2003 to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in other molecular biology product lines mainly resulted from lower sales of products and services previously produced at our Huntsville, Alabama location and to lower sales in our custom oligonucleotides business. If revenue growth for our core molecular biology products slows further, or if revenues for oligonucleotides and custom services continue to decline, this could result in a material negative impact on our revenue for 2003 and beyond. Cell Culture Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Cell Culture segment for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $0.2 million, or 0%, from $219.9 million in 2001 to $219.7 million in 2002. The $219.7 million of Cell Culture revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes $0.7 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $29.9 million of these products sold in 2001, which included revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues by $1.8 million. 27 Table of Contents The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of continuing Cell Culture products during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 14% from 2001. This increase reflects sales of Cell Culture products for both research applications and large scale production applications that increased 15% and 13%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2002. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. Gross Margin. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2002, was 58% compared with 55% for 2001. We have instituted various programs to improve gross margin since the Life Technologies merger in 2000, including cost reductions, price adjustments and the discontinuation or sale of lower margin product lines. Gross margin for the Molecular Biology segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, was 62% and 61%, and for the Cell Culture segment was 51% and 44%, respectively. The significant increase in the Cell Culture gross margin in 2002 from 2001 was attributable to lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued products, a favorable change in the mix of higher margin, proprietary media sales in 2002, and higher selling prices in 2002, especially for fetal bovine serum. While these items combined had a favorable impact in 2002, we expect margins for our Cell Culture segment to be lower during 2003 as higher serum costs will reduce gross margins. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, and foreign currency rates. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $12.0 million from $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $124.9 million for 2002. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased from 18% for 2001 to 19% for 2002. The absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to increased headcount and promotional spending, partially offset by reductions from the closure of our Alabama location in April 2002, the sale of our BioSepra entity in July 2001 and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 for the Molecular Biology segment were $94.9 million, or 22% of segment revenues compared to $84.0 million, or 21% for 2001. Sales and marketing expenses for Cell Culture were $29.9 million, or 14% of segment revenues for 2002 compared to $28.4 million, or 13% for 2001. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $5.4 million from $65.7 million in 2001 to $71.1 million in 2002. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased from 10% in 2001 to 11% in 2002. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses is due to costs associated with the retirement of our chief executive officer, increased headcount in Carlsbad and related increased spending, and costs to purchase the rights to change in control agreements from four key management members, partially offset by cost reductions from the closure of our operations in Alabama and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 for the Molecular Biology segment were $36.0 million, or 8% of segment revenues compared to $39.2 million, or 10% for 2001. General and administrative expenses for Cell Culture for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $13.5 million, or 6% of segment revenues compared to $11.9 million, or 5% for 2001. Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased $4.4 million from $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $33.7 million for 2002. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 6% in 2001 to 5% in 2002. The decrease in research and development expenses reflects the transition of research and development positions from our Maryland facilities to California during 2001 and the closure of our Alabama facility in 2002. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 6% of revenues in 2003, driven by spending for our newly acquired software business and increased headcount for molecular biology research and development. 28 Table of Contents Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002, for the Molecular Biology segment were $27.8 million, or 6% of segment revenues compared to $32.9 million, or 8% for 2001. Research and development expenses for Cell Culture for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $5.9 million, or 3% of segment revenues compared to $5.0 million, or 2% for 2001. Goodwill Amortization. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. The adoption of these statements also resulted in the reclassification of the net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, to goodwill. Amortization expense for goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, totaled $180.5 million and $53.9 million, respectively. SFAS No. 142 requires a transitional evaluation for impairment of goodwill balances upon adoption of the new accounting pronouncement. We completed our transitional review for potential impairment of goodwill that existed at January 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed at January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances. We completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date. A significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; and unanticipated competition or loss of key personnel are among many factors that could result in an impairment charge that could have a material negative impact on our operating results. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $85.7 million for 2001. The reduction in expense from 2001 to 2002 resulted from the reclassification of the assembled workforce intangible to goodwill and the assignment of an indefinite life to the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks allocated to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, both of these intangibles are no longer amortized beginning January 1, 2002. The reduction in expense also resulted from the sale of our BioSepra business in July 2001 and the related disposition of purchased intangibles assigned to that business in addition to one intangible asset that became fully amortized in September 2001. Business Integration Costs. In April 2002, we announced our plan to integrate our operations in Alabama with the rest of the company. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $13.9 million which includes $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Future restructuring costs associated with the Huntsville closure are expected to be minimal, unless actual proceeds from the sale of real estate in Huntsville are significantly different than our current estimates. Merger related business integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2002, totaled $2.3 million, respectively, and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. We have now completed our planned restructuring activities associated with the Life Technologies merger. Future restructuring costs associated with the InforMax integration are expected to be approximately $0.9 million for retention and relocation of employees during the first six to nine months in 2003. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $7.1 million from $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $27.4 million for 2002. The increase during 2002 was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during 2002, partially offset by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2002. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances which could be materially reduced by acquisitions and our stock buyback program. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $12.8 million from $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $24.1 million for 2002. The increase in 2002 was due mainly to interest on the 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. 29 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2002 and 2001 includes net periodic pension income from an overfunded defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000, as well as gains and losses on the sale of assets and businesses, and foreign currency transactions. The net periodic pension income is recognized as other non operating income since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2002, other expense, net, of $0.6 million includes $1.3 million of net periodic pension income, a loss of $0.5 million on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, a loss of $0.3 million on the sale of our Indian subsidiary and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, other income, net, includes $2.5 million of net periodic pension income, a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a product line, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a facility in Europe, a $0.4 million gain on the sale of our BioSepra business and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.5 million. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 31.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a negative 6.8% in 2001. The change from 2001 was primarily attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Such amortization was non deductible for tax purposes. For 2001, a $9.3 million tax provision was provided on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in pre tax income are certain business integration costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that provide financial reporting tax benefits at rates higher than our effective tax rate for all other pre tax income. Excluding the impact of these costs and expense, our effective tax rate was 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 35.4% for the 2001. Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $383.1 million, or 156%, from $246.2 million in 2000 to $629.3 million for 2001. The acquisition of Life Technologies accounted for a significant portion of the increase in revenues. Due to the integration of our operations that began during the fourth quarter of 2000, the precise amount of the increase in revenues due to Life Technologies is not determinable. Additionally, subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. We have also reclassified revenues by segment reported for 2001 and 2000 to conform to the segment classifications used in 2002. Pro Forma and Segment Revenues. Given the significant impact of the Life Technologies acquisition on our overall financial results, we believe that it would be helpful for our investors to compare our revenues for 2001 and 2000 as if our revenues included those of Life Technologies for the full year of 2000. Therefore, we have provided pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. The pro forma revenues reported for 2001 and 2000 by segment have been reallocated to conform to the segment classifications used in 2002. We have also provided revenue comparisons below on a foreign currency constant basis, in order to clarify for investors the changes in our revenues that are unrelated to foreign currency exchange effects. 30 Table of Contents Molecular Cell Biology Culture Total (dollars in thousands)(unaudited) Pro forma Revenue Growth for the Year Ended December 31, 2001(1) Revenues for the year 2001 $ 409,396 $ 219,894 $ 629,290 Adjust for effect of foreign currency exchange rates(2) 9,764 6,469 16,233 Currency adjusted revenues $ 419,160 $ 226,363 $ 645,523 Revenues for the year 2001 $ 409,396 $ 219,894 $ 629,290 Less revenues from discontinued products(3) (12,091 ) (29,859 ) (41,950 ) Revenues from continuing products 397,305 190,035 587,340 Adjust for effect of foreign currency exchange rates on continuing products(2) 9,269 5,268 14,537 Currency adjusted revenues from continuing products $ 406,574 $ 195,303 $ 601,877 Pro forma Revenues for the year 2000(1)(4) $ 361,241 $ 205,736 $ 566,977 Less revenues from discontinued products(3) (28,565 ) (36,345 ) (64,910 ) Pro forma Revenues from continuing products $ 332,676 $ 169,391 $ 502,067 Revenue growth for the year 2001 13% 7% 11% Currency adjusted revenue growth 16% 10% 14% Revenue growth for continuing products 19% 12% 17% Currency adjusted revenue growth for continuing products 22% 15% 20% (1) 2002 presentation of 2001 and 2000 revenues by segment reflects reclassifications of revenues between segments due to changes in segment categorization of certain products. (2) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the same period in the prior year affected dollar denominated revenues. These adjustments are to arrive at dollar denominated revenues assuming foreign currency exchange rates that are constant with those during the comparable period of last year. (3) Subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. (4) Pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, are provided on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased $62.3 million, or 11%, from pro forma revenues of $567.0 million in 2000 to $629.3 million in 2001. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates when comparing the year ended December 31, 2001, with the pro forma year of 2000 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $16.2 million. Holding foreign currency exchange rates constant with those during the year ended December 31, 2000 revenues during 2001 would have been $645.5 million, an increase of 14% from pro forma 2000 revenues. Molecular Biology Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $48.2 million, or 13%, from pro forma segment revenues of $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $409.4 million in 2001. The $409.4 million of Molecular Biology revenues in 2001 is comprised of $397.3 million of continuing products and $12.1 million of discontinued products. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced dollar denominated Molecular Biology revenues by $9.8 million when comparing 2001 with pro forma revenues of 2000. The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of Molecular Biology products increased 22% from pro forma 2000 revenues. The 22% increase reflects primarily the continued growth of the cloning & gene expression, separations & analysis and amplification product lines, which increased 25% in 2001. Other product lines, including oligonucleotides, custom services, licensing and royalties, increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cell Culture Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Cell Culture segment for the year ended December 31 increased $14.2 million, or 7%, from pro forma segment revenues of $205.7 million in 2000 to $219.9 million in 2001. The $219.9 million of Cell Culture revenues in 2001 is comprised of 31 Table of Contents $190.0 million of continuing products and $29.9 million of discontinued products, which includes revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2001 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $6.5 million. The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of Cell Culture products increased 15% from pro forma 2000 revenues. This increase reflects sales of Cell Culture products for large scale production applications that increased 34% in 2001. These unaudited pro forma results for our two business segments have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the combinations been in effect on January 1, 2000, or of future results of operations. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 55% compared with 49% for the same period in 2000. Cost of sales in 2000 included $16.6 million of merger related inventory valuation charges from the Life Technologies merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, inventories acquired in the merger are recorded at their fair value, which generally requires a non cash write up to estimated selling prices less the cost to sell or dispose of the inventory. Subsequent sales of this inventory result in costs of sales that are generally higher than our manufactured inventory, which is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Excluding this non cash incremental cost, gross margin was 56% in 2000. Consolidated gross margin for the periods after the merger with Life Technologies were lower than Invitrogens consolidated gross margin before the merger principally because of the inclusion of lower margin products from the Life Technologies business. The Company instituted various programs to improve gross margins since the Life Technologies merger, including cost reductions, price adjustments and the discontinuation or sale of lower margin product lines. Gross margin for the Molecular Biology segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 61% and for the Cell Culture segment was 44%. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $66.5 million from $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $112.8 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 19% in 2000 to 18% in 2001. The reduction as a percentage of revenues resulted from the addition of the Cell Culture segment from the Life Technologies merger which has a lower ratio of sales and marketing costs to revenues and to the closure of a distribution facility in the Netherlands. Additionally, 2000 included costs incurred for a new brand recognition program. The addition of Life Technologies accounted for the majority of the absolute increase for 2001. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $84.0 million, or 21% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $28.4 million, or 13% of segment revenues. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 increased $38.9 million from $26.8 million in 2000 to $65.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 11% in 2000 to 10% in 2001. The absolute increase during 2001 resulted from the addition of Life Technologies, higher legal costs for ongoing litigation to protect our patents, duplicate staffing at our Rockville and Carlsbad sites as we transitioned employees and functions to Carlsbad and continued expansion of administrative resources to support our growth. The decrease as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, occurred primarily because a fixed portion of our general and administrative expense was spread over a larger revenue base. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the Molecular Biology segment were $39.2 million, or 10% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $11.9 million, or 5% of segment revenues. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $14.5 million from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $38.1 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 10% in 2000 to 6% in 2001. The absolute increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the addition of Life Technologies in addition to new collaborative research and development projects and a $0.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 to write off software developed to operate high through put processing equipment that did not perform as expected. The software has no alternative future use. The decline as a percentage of 32 Table of Contents revenues also reflects the impact of Life Technologies, whose historical percentage averaged 5% to 6% of revenues. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $32.9 million, or 8% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $5.0 million, or 2% of segment revenues. Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. The increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets from $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $266.2 million for 2001 is due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Life Technologies and Dexter, which are amortized using the straight line method primarily over periods ranging from five to thirteen years. Merger Costs. Merger costs for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $11.3 million and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $7.0 million in retention, severance and relocation costs as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California, $1.8 million in costs to exit distributor contracts, $1.6 million in business reorganization consulting fees and $0.7 million in product catalogue obsolescence. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $1.6 million from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $20.3 million for 2001 and was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during the year ended December 31, 2001, reduced by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.4 million from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $11.3 million in 2001, due mainly to interest on the 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 that were issued in March 2000 and the 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. Other Income, Net. Other income, net, increased $1.4 million to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2.9 million for 2000. The $4.3 million in 2001 is comprised mainly of $2.5 million in net periodic pension income from the Dexter Postretirement Health Benefit Program, a $1.2 million gain on the sale of an electrophoresis product line acquired in the merger with Life Technologies, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in the Netherlands, a $0.4 million gain on the sale of our BioSepra business, reduced by $1.5 million in net foreign currency exchange losses. Income Tax Benefit (Provision). The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $9.3 million on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in the pre tax loss are certain merger related costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of these costs and expense, our effective tax rate was 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 35.3% for 2000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities provided net cash of $123.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Business integration costs incurred to integrate our operations in Alabama with the rest of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $13.9 million and includes $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Future restructuring costs associated with the Huntsville closure are expected to be minimal, unless actual proceeds from the sale of real estate in Huntsville are significantly different than our current estimates. Merger related business integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2002, totaled $2.3 million and were attributed to the restructuring and integration of the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. As of December 31, 2002, we had $3.5 million in accrued merger and restructuring related costs that are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the majority of which we expect to pay during the first six to nine months in 2003. 33 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $386.9 million, and reflects a net $329.7 million that was invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months. It also includes payments for capital expenditures and intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties) during the year ended December 31, 2002, which totaled $51.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities also includes a net $6.4 million paid for our acquisitions of InforMax and Serum Technologies Pty Limited, which reflects gross cash payments of $50.3 million less cash and cash equivalents acquired of $43.9 million. These net uses were offset by $1.1 million in cash received, net of cash sold, from the sale of our Serva subsidiary. For the year ending December 31, 2003, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate $50 million. We are offering for sale certain facilities in Frederick, Maryland and Huntsville, Alabama which became idle or excess as we have consolidated our operations. At December 31, 2002, we have $15.1 million recorded as assets held for sale for these facilities, which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In February 2003, we sold one of the Huntsville facilities for $2.7 million, which approximated the carrying value of the facility at December 31, 2002. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $92.9 million, and includes $94.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and $2.8 million used to reduce our outstanding line of credit balance in Japan to zero, offset by $5.0 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. In July 2002, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over the next three years. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost, in cash and accruals, of $100.0 million through December 31, 2002, which has been reported as a reduction in stockholders equity as Treasury Stock. The timing and price of future repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. Funds for the repurchase are expected to come primarily from cash generated from operations, or funds on hand. In December 2002, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of InforMax, Inc. (Nasdaq: INMX), for cash of $42.8 million. Direct costs incurred as a result of the acquisition were $5.5 million and $0.1 million was incurred as merger related business integration costs. We expect to incur an additional $0.9 million during the first six to nine months of 2003 for retention and relocation of employees. On February 4, 2003, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq:VRTX) to acquire the biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents, probes and proteins of PanVera LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertex, for $95.0 million in cash, subject to normal purchase conditions and adjustments. We also expect to assume debt and incur closing costs of approximately $10 million in connection with this transaction. The transaction is anticipated to close, subject to regulatory review, in the first or early second quarter of 2003. We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our molecular biology and cell culture platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a reduction in our current tax liability of $1.2 million representing the tax benefit for non qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of our common stock by employees during the year. This benefit is reflected as additional paid in capital in the December 31, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. During this same time period we also recognized a $4.5 million reduction in additional paid in capital and an offsetting increase in our taxes payable resulting from amendments to 2001 taxable income subsequent to 2001 for some employees as they provided changes to their taxable transaction survey letters. We have $500 million principal amount of 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 2 1/4% Convertible Notes, due 2006, outstanding at December 31, 2002. Interest on the 2 1/4% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 2 1/4% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of any holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 2 1/4% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount. 34 Table of Contents We also have $172.5 million principal amount of 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 5 1/2% Convertible Notes, due 2007, outstanding at December 31, 2002. Interest on the 5 1/2% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on March 1st and September 1st. The 5 1/2% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 2.0 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $85.20 per share. The 5 1/2% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after March 1, 2003, at an initial premium of 103.143% of the principal amount. The premium declines annually to 100% of the principal amount of the notes at March 1, 2007. In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the 2 1/4% Convertible Notes and the 5 1/2% Convertible Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of $537.8 million, short term investments of $184.2 million, long term investments of $338.5 million and working capital of $818.1 million, excluding restricted cash and investments. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, corporate notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2002, foreign subsidiaries in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $6.3 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2002. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2002, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period Less than Years Years More than Total 1 Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt $ 674,575 $ 2,075 $ $ 672,500 $ Capital lease obligations 323 216 107 Operating lease obligations 62,346 13,026 19,130 13,415 16,775 Licensing and purchase obligations 44,875 16,615 18,503 8,798 959 Deferred compensation 1,487 165 1,322 Total $ 783,606 $ 32,097 $ 39,062 $ 694,713 $ 17,734 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. We recognize software license revenues in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 02, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended and interpreted. Our software sales generally consist of software license fees and maintenance fees. Software license fees are recognized as revenue when shipped, 35 Table of Contents under the residual method. We customarily include the maintenance renewal rate in the license arrangements. We recorded these maintenance fees as deferred revenue when the software is shipped and amortize the revenue on a straight line basis over the maintenance period which is typically one year. We recognize royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Where we receive a one time up front license fee, even though it may be non refundable, we generally record the payment as deferred revenue and amortize it into revenue over the life of the licensing contract. The portion of the up front fee that we defer or recognize is dependant on the terms of the agreement and the facts and circumstances specific to the contract, which include: our ongoing involvement and provision of services or product, milestones, the current market rate for royalties, our historical royalty rates imposed on similar licensing contracts, specific facts involved in the negotiation of the contract, and buy downs on annual royalty rates. Deferred revenue totaled $11.5 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $99.5 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.4 million at December 31, 2002. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Inventories were stated at $85.5 million at December 31, 2002. Valuation of goodwill. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became effective and as a result, we ceased amortization of goodwill. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an annual review for impairment. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required 36 Table of Contents if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we performed a transitional review for impairment of our goodwill as of January 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. SFAS No. 142 also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances. We also completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill on October 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. We cannot assure you that when we complete our annual or other periodic review for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $768.5 million at December 31, 2002. Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2002, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $336.7 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $136.2 million. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain 37 Table of Contents Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), and EITF Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $3.5 million at December 31, 2002, the majority of which we expect to pay during the first six to nine months of 2003. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon managements commitment to an exit plan, which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will impact the timing of exit or disposal costs reported by us after adoption. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $10.6 million at December 31, 2002. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Valuation of deferred income taxes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by 38 Table of Contents the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our assets to our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments. We also do not report product line information as it would be impracticable to do so. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, which is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2003. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 145 will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon managements commitment to an exit plan, which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will impact the timing of exit or disposal costs reported by us after adoption. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 is an amendment to SFAS No. 123 providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. Amendments are effective for financial statements for the Company beginning January 1, 2003. The Company has currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. If the Company should choose to adopt such a method its implementation pursuant to SFAS No. 148 could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $648.6 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the prior year ended December 31, 2001 to our non U.S. revenues for 2002 results in revenues of $644.1 million. Therefore, as a result of the change in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, our 2002 revenues reported in U.S. dollars were positively affected by $4.5 million. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. To assist investors with the comparisons of our underlying business between currently reported periods, we have provided our revenue and growth rate results on a foreign currency comparable basis. 39 Table of Contents MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses in the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange losses recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $1.1 million, $1.5 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the Euro, British Pound sterling and Japanese Yen. We currently use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on non functional currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2002, we had $20.4 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which all settle on various dates through January 2003, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. We currently do not enter into financial contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk on transactions forecasted to arise beyond 30 days. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002, our cash equivalents and short term investments were invested primarily in securities with maturities of less than three months and, as a result, the fair value of these securities approximated carrying value due to their short term nature. The fair value of our long term investments, however, is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of our long term investments did not differ materially from carrying value. It is currently our intent to hold all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities until maturity, and, accordingly, their carrying values are not adjusted for changes in fair value. Thus, any potential changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates would not affect our financial position or results of operations. We would, however, be at risk for lower earnings should interest rates decline. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See discussion under Market Risk in Item 7.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We develop, manufacture, and market products for the life sciences markets. Our products are principally research tools in reagent and kit form, biochemicals, sera, media and other products and services that we sell to corporate, government, and academic entities. We focus our business on two principal segments: Molecular Biology. We are a leading supplier of research kits that simplify and improve gene cloning, gene expression, and gene analysis techniques. We also supply a full range of related molecular biology products including enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents, and informatics software. Cell Culture. We are also a leading supplier of sera, cell and tissue culture media and reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce pharmaceuticals and other materials made by cultured cells. Our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture products are used for research purposes, and their use by our customers is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our Cell Culture products and manufacturing sites are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations, which was formerly known as current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, and is described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Carlsbad, California; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; and Inchinnan, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We sell our products throughout the world via subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries. The majority of our sales activities are conducted through a dedicated direct sales organization located in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We also conduct marketing and distribution activities through our subsidiaries. Additionally, we sell through international distributors who resell Invitrogen kits and products. These distributors are located primarily in selected territories in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia. We may choose in the future to establish a direct sales organization in these and additional territories. We conduct research activities in the United States and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Our revenues have increased significantly since our inception. The increase in our revenues has been due to several factors: acquisitions; the continued growth of the market for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis kits, cell culture products and other products and related services; increasing market acceptance of these kits and products; our introduction of new research kits and products for gene identification, cloning, expression, and analysis; our ability to increase prices; and the expansion of our direct sales and marketing efforts. We plan to continue to introduce new research kits, as we believe continued new product development and rapid product introduction is a critical competitive factor in the market for molecular biology research kits. We may also continue to grow our business through acquisitions. To support increased levels of sales and to augment our long term competitive position, we may increase expenditures in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development. Except for our oligonucleotide, genomics services and cell culture production businesses, which are made to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We have acquired a significant number of licenses to use patented technologies from third parties as part of our business activities. We use these licenses as a basis for the development of many of our 24 Table of Contents research kits and other products. We pay royalties to third parties on sales of these research kits, other products and selected services. We recognize royalty expense as a cost of revenue as we incur the related royalties. On December 6, 2002, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of InforMax, Inc., a provider of a multi application suite of data access, analysis and presentation software for life science applications. The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase, and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. On September 14, 2000, we completed our mergers with Life Technologies and Dexter. Substantially all of the businesses and operations of Dexter, other than Life Technologies, were sold prior to the closing of the mergers. Both transactions have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which significantly affects the comparability of the financial information presented. On June 21, 2000, and February 2, 2000, we completed our acquisitions of Ethrog and Research Genetics, respectively. These transactions have been accounted for as pooling of interests, and the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined financial and operating results of Invitrogen, Ethrog and Research Genetics. In 2001, as a result of our acquisition of Life Technologies, we reorganized into two lines of business, a Molecular Biology segment and a Cell Culture segment and are reporting results by segment for 2002 and 2001. Other than the pro forma revenue information as set forth on pages 30 and 31, segment financial information for Molecular Biology and Cell Culture prior to 2001 has not been provided, as it would be impracticable to do so. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and may continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors that may Affect Future Results. In addition, our results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors, the mix of sales among distributors and our direct sales force. Although we have experienced growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that our growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts. 25 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Business Segment Highlights for the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

(2) 2002 presentation of 2001 revenues and gross margin by segment reflects reclassifications of revenues and gross margin between segments due to changes in segment categorization of certain products. (3) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the same period in the prior year affected dollar denominated revenues. These adjustments are to arrive at dollar denominated revenues 26 Table of Contents assuming foreign currency exchange rates that are constant with those during the comparable period of last year. (4) Subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Revenues. In addition to our analysis of changes in reported revenues, we have also provided revenue comparisons on a foreign currency constant basis, to clarify the changes in our revenues that are unrelated to foreign currency translation effects. We have also reclassified revenues by segment reported for 2001 to conform to the segment classifications used in 2002. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $19.3 million, or 3%, from $629.3 million in 2001 to $648.6 million for 2002. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2002, with 2001, increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $4.5 million of the $19.3 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates also increased our revenue growth rate by 1%. Subsequent to the merger with Life Technologies that occurred in September 2000, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Sales of these products were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, down from $42.0 million for 2001. Revenues from continuing products for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 9% from 2001, when holding foreign currency exchange rates constant. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the British Pound sterling and the Euro, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to foreign currency rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price changes, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. Molecular Biology Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $19.5 million, or 5%, from $409.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $428.9 million in 2002. The $428.9 million of Molecular Biology revenues in 2002 includes $3.2 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $12.1 million sold in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased dollar denominated Molecular Biology revenues by $2.7 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2002 with the same period in 2001. The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of Molecular Biology products during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 6% from 2001 revenues. Sales of our cloning and gene expression, separation and analysis, and amplification products lines, increased 15% during the year ended December 31, 2002 from 2001. Revenues from our other molecular biology product lines, including oligonucleotides, custom services, licensing and royalties, for the year ended December 31, 2002 were 28% lower than such revenues in 2001. Sales growth for our cloning and gene expression, separations and analysis, and amplification product lines, slowed during this year to a 15% revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, the sales growth rate for these products slowed to 11% in the fourth quarter of 2002. Currently, we expect our revenue growth rate for this portion of our business for 2003 to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in other molecular biology product lines mainly resulted from lower sales of products and services previously produced at our Huntsville, Alabama location and to lower sales in our custom oligonucleotides business. If revenue growth for our core molecular biology products slows further, or if revenues for oligonucleotides and custom services continue to decline, this could result in a material negative impact on our revenue for 2003 and beyond. Cell Culture Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Cell Culture segment for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $0.2 million, or 0%, from $219.9 million in 2001 to $219.7 million in 2002. The $219.7 million of Cell Culture revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes $0.7 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $29.9 million of these products sold in 2001, which included revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues by $1.8 million. 27 Table of Contents The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of continuing Cell Culture products during the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 14% from 2001. This increase reflects sales of Cell Culture products for both research applications and large scale production applications that increased 15% and 13%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2002. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. Gross Margin. Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2002, was 58% compared with 55% for 2001. We have instituted various programs to improve gross margin since the Life Technologies merger in 2000, including cost reductions, price adjustments and the discontinuation or sale of lower margin product lines. Gross margin for the Molecular Biology segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, was 62% and 61%, and for the Cell Culture segment was 51% and 44%, respectively. The significant increase in the Cell Culture gross margin in 2002 from 2001 was attributable to lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued products, a favorable change in the mix of higher margin, proprietary media sales in 2002, and higher selling prices in 2002, especially for fetal bovine serum. While these items combined had a favorable impact in 2002, we expect margins for our Cell Culture segment to be lower during 2003 as higher serum costs will reduce gross margins. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, and foreign currency rates. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $12.0 million from $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $124.9 million for 2002. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased from 18% for 2001 to 19% for 2002. The absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to increased headcount and promotional spending, partially offset by reductions from the closure of our Alabama location in April 2002, the sale of our BioSepra entity in July 2001 and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 for the Molecular Biology segment were $94.9 million, or 22% of segment revenues compared to $84.0 million, or 21% for 2001. Sales and marketing expenses for Cell Culture were $29.9 million, or 14% of segment revenues for 2002 compared to $28.4 million, or 13% for 2001. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $5.4 million from $65.7 million in 2001 to $71.1 million in 2002. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased from 10% in 2001 to 11% in 2002. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses is due to costs associated with the retirement of our chief executive officer, increased headcount in Carlsbad and related increased spending, and costs to purchase the rights to change in control agreements from four key management members, partially offset by cost reductions from the closure of our operations in Alabama and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 for the Molecular Biology segment were $36.0 million, or 8% of segment revenues compared to $39.2 million, or 10% for 2001. General and administrative expenses for Cell Culture for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $13.5 million, or 6% of segment revenues compared to $11.9 million, or 5% for 2001. Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased $4.4 million from $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $33.7 million for 2002. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 6% in 2001 to 5% in 2002. The decrease in research and development expenses reflects the transition of research and development positions from our Maryland facilities to California during 2001 and the closure of our Alabama facility in 2002. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 6% of revenues in 2003, driven by spending for our newly acquired software business and increased headcount for molecular biology research and development. 28 Table of Contents Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002, for the Molecular Biology segment were $27.8 million, or 6% of segment revenues compared to $32.9 million, or 8% for 2001. Research and development expenses for Cell Culture for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $5.9 million, or 3% of segment revenues compared to $5.0 million, or 2% for 2001. Goodwill Amortization. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. The adoption of these statements also resulted in the reclassification of the net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, to goodwill. Amortization expense for goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, totaled $180.5 million and $53.9 million, respectively. SFAS No. 142 requires a transitional evaluation for impairment of goodwill balances upon adoption of the new accounting pronouncement. We completed our transitional review for potential impairment of goodwill that existed at January 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed at January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances. We completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date. A significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; and unanticipated competition or loss of key personnel are among many factors that could result in an impairment charge that could have a material negative impact on our operating results. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $85.7 million for 2001. The reduction in expense from 2001 to 2002 resulted from the reclassification of the assembled workforce intangible to goodwill and the assignment of an indefinite life to the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks allocated to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, both of these intangibles are no longer amortized beginning January 1, 2002. The reduction in expense also resulted from the sale of our BioSepra business in July 2001 and the related disposition of purchased intangibles assigned to that business in addition to one intangible asset that became fully amortized in September 2001. Business Integration Costs. In April 2002, we announced our plan to integrate our operations in Alabama with the rest of the company. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $13.9 million which includes $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Future restructuring costs associated with the Huntsville closure are expected to be minimal, unless actual proceeds from the sale of real estate in Huntsville are significantly different than our current estimates. Merger related business integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2002, totaled $2.3 million, respectively, and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. We have now completed our planned restructuring activities associated with the Life Technologies merger. Future restructuring costs associated with the InforMax integration are expected to be approximately $0.9 million for retention and relocation of employees during the first six to nine months in 2003. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $7.1 million from $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $27.4 million for 2002. The increase during 2002 was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during 2002, partially offset by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2002. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances which could be materially reduced by acquisitions and our stock buyback program. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $12.8 million from $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $24.1 million for 2002. The increase in 2002 was due mainly to interest on the 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. 29 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2002 and 2001 includes net periodic pension income from an overfunded defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000, as well as gains and losses on the sale of assets and businesses, and foreign currency transactions. The net periodic pension income is recognized as other non operating income since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2002, other expense, net, of $0.6 million includes $1.3 million of net periodic pension income, a loss of $0.5 million on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, a loss of $0.3 million on the sale of our Indian subsidiary and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, other income, net, includes $2.5 million of net periodic pension income, a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a product line, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a facility in Europe, a $0.4 million gain on the sale of our BioSepra business and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.5 million. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 31.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a negative 6.8% in 2001. The change from 2001 was primarily attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Such amortization was non deductible for tax purposes. For 2001, a $9.3 million tax provision was provided on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in pre tax income are certain business integration costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that provide financial reporting tax benefits at rates higher than our effective tax rate for all other pre tax income. Excluding the impact of these costs and expense, our effective tax rate was 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 35.4% for the 2001. Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Revenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $383.1 million, or 156%, from $246.2 million in 2000 to $629.3 million for 2001. The acquisition of Life Technologies accounted for a significant portion of the increase in revenues. Due to the integration of our operations that began during the fourth quarter of 2000, the precise amount of the increase in revenues due to Life Technologies is not determinable. Additionally, subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. We have also reclassified revenues by segment reported for 2001 and 2000 to conform to the segment classifications used in 2002. Pro Forma and Segment Revenues. Given the significant impact of the Life Technologies acquisition on our overall financial results, we believe that it would be helpful for our investors to compare our revenues for 2001 and 2000 as if our revenues included those of Life Technologies for the full year of 2000. Therefore, we have provided pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. The pro forma revenues reported for 2001 and 2000 by segment have been reallocated to conform to the segment classifications used in 2002. We have also provided revenue comparisons below on a foreign currency constant basis, in order to clarify for investors the changes in our revenues that are unrelated to foreign currency exchange effects. 30 Table of Contents Molecular Cell Biology Culture Total (dollars in thousands)(unaudited) Pro forma Revenue Growth for the Year Ended December 31, 2001(1) Revenues for the year 2001 $ 409,396 $ 219,894 $ 629,290 Adjust for effect of foreign currency exchange rates(2) 9,764 6,469 16,233 Currency adjusted revenues $ 419,160 $ 226,363 $ 645,523 Revenues for the year 2001 $ 409,396 $ 219,894 $ 629,290 Less revenues from discontinued products(3) (12,091 ) (29,859 ) (41,950 ) Revenues from continuing products 397,305 190,035 587,340 Adjust for effect of foreign currency exchange rates on continuing products(2) 9,269 5,268 14,537 Currency adjusted revenues from continuing products $ 406,574 $ 195,303 $ 601,877 Pro forma Revenues for the year 2000(1)(4) $ 361,241 $ 205,736 $ 566,977 Less revenues from discontinued products(3) (28,565 ) (36,345 ) (64,910 ) Pro forma Revenues from continuing products $ 332,676 $ 169,391 $ 502,067 Revenue growth for the year 2001 13% 7% 11% Currency adjusted revenue growth 16% 10% 14% Revenue growth for continuing products 19% 12% 17% Currency adjusted revenue growth for continuing products 22% 15% 20% (1) 2002 presentation of 2001 and 2000 revenues by segment reflects reclassifications of revenues between segments due to changes in segment categorization of certain products. (2) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the same period in the prior year affected dollar denominated revenues. These adjustments are to arrive at dollar denominated revenues assuming foreign currency exchange rates that are constant with those during the comparable period of last year. (3) Subsequent to the date of the merger with Life Technologies, we discontinued the sale of products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. (4) Pro forma and segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, are provided on an unaudited, pro forma basis, assuming that the merger with Life Technologies occurred on January 1, 2000. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased $62.3 million, or 11%, from pro forma revenues of $567.0 million in 2000 to $629.3 million in 2001. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates when comparing the year ended December 31, 2001, with the pro forma year of 2000 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $16.2 million. Holding foreign currency exchange rates constant with those during the year ended December 31, 2000 revenues during 2001 would have been $645.5 million, an increase of 14% from pro forma 2000 revenues. Molecular Biology Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Molecular Biology segment increased $48.2 million, or 13%, from pro forma segment revenues of $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $409.4 million in 2001. The $409.4 million of Molecular Biology revenues in 2001 is comprised of $397.3 million of continuing products and $12.1 million of discontinued products. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced dollar denominated Molecular Biology revenues by $9.8 million when comparing 2001 with pro forma revenues of 2000. The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of Molecular Biology products increased 22% from pro forma 2000 revenues. The 22% increase reflects primarily the continued growth of the cloning & gene expression, separations & analysis and amplification product lines, which increased 25% in 2001. Other product lines, including oligonucleotides, custom services, licensing and royalties, increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Cell Culture Segment Revenues. Revenues for the Cell Culture segment for the year ended December 31 increased $14.2 million, or 7%, from pro forma segment revenues of $205.7 million in 2000 to $219.9 million in 2001. The $219.9 million of Cell Culture revenues in 2001 is comprised of 31 Table of Contents $190.0 million of continuing products and $29.9 million of discontinued products, which includes revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001. On a pro forma basis, changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2001 reduced dollar denominated revenues by $6.5 million. The following revenue discussion is based on continuing products and is on a currency comparable basis so as to exclude the effect of discontinued products and currency rate changes. Sales of Cell Culture products increased 15% from pro forma 2000 revenues. This increase reflects sales of Cell Culture products for large scale production applications that increased 34% in 2001. These unaudited pro forma results for our two business segments have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the combinations been in effect on January 1, 2000, or of future results of operations. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 55% compared with 49% for the same period in 2000. Cost of sales in 2000 included $16.6 million of merger related inventory valuation charges from the Life Technologies merger. Under the purchase method of accounting, inventories acquired in the merger are recorded at their fair value, which generally requires a non cash write up to estimated selling prices less the cost to sell or dispose of the inventory. Subsequent sales of this inventory result in costs of sales that are generally higher than our manufactured inventory, which is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Excluding this non cash incremental cost, gross margin was 56% in 2000. Consolidated gross margin for the periods after the merger with Life Technologies were lower than Invitrogens consolidated gross margin before the merger principally because of the inclusion of lower margin products from the Life Technologies business. The Company instituted various programs to improve gross margins since the Life Technologies merger, including cost reductions, price adjustments and the discontinuation or sale of lower margin product lines. Gross margin for the Molecular Biology segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, was 61% and for the Cell Culture segment was 44%. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $66.5 million from $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $112.8 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 19% in 2000 to 18% in 2001. The reduction as a percentage of revenues resulted from the addition of the Cell Culture segment from the Life Technologies merger which has a lower ratio of sales and marketing costs to revenues and to the closure of a distribution facility in the Netherlands. Additionally, 2000 included costs incurred for a new brand recognition program. The addition of Life Technologies accounted for the majority of the absolute increase for 2001. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $84.0 million, or 21% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $28.4 million, or 13% of segment revenues. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 increased $38.9 million from $26.8 million in 2000 to $65.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 11% in 2000 to 10% in 2001. The absolute increase during 2001 resulted from the addition of Life Technologies, higher legal costs for ongoing litigation to protect our patents, duplicate staffing at our Rockville and Carlsbad sites as we transitioned employees and functions to Carlsbad and continued expansion of administrative resources to support our growth. The decrease as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, occurred primarily because a fixed portion of our general and administrative expense was spread over a larger revenue base. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the Molecular Biology segment were $39.2 million, or 10% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $11.9 million, or 5% of segment revenues. Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $14.5 million from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $38.1 million for 2001. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses decreased from 10% in 2000 to 6% in 2001. The absolute increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the addition of Life Technologies in addition to new collaborative research and development projects and a $0.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 to write off software developed to operate high through put processing equipment that did not perform as expected. The software has no alternative future use. The decline as a percentage of 32 Table of Contents revenues also reflects the impact of Life Technologies, whose historical percentage averaged 5% to 6% of revenues. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, for the Molecular Biology segment were $32.9 million, or 8% of segment revenues, and for Cell Culture were $5.0 million, or 2% of segment revenues. Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. The increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets from $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $266.2 million for 2001 is due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Life Technologies and Dexter, which are amortized using the straight line method primarily over periods ranging from five to thirteen years. Merger Costs. Merger costs for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $11.3 million and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $7.0 million in retention, severance and relocation costs as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California, $1.8 million in costs to exit distributor contracts, $1.6 million in business reorganization consulting fees and $0.7 million in product catalogue obsolescence. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $1.6 million from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $20.3 million for 2001 and was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during the year ended December 31, 2001, reduced by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $2.4 million from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $11.3 million in 2001, due mainly to interest on the 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 that were issued in March 2000 and the 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. Other Income, Net. Other income, net, increased $1.4 million to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2.9 million for 2000. The $4.3 million in 2001 is comprised mainly of $2.5 million in net periodic pension income from the Dexter Postretirement Health Benefit Program, a $1.2 million gain on the sale of an electrophoresis product line acquired in the merger with Life Technologies, a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in the Netherlands, a $0.4 million gain on the sale of our BioSepra business, reduced by $1.5 million in net foreign currency exchange losses. Income Tax Benefit (Provision). The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $9.3 million on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in the pre tax loss are certain merger related costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of these costs and expense, our effective tax rate was 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 35.3% for 2000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities provided net cash of $123.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Business integration costs incurred to integrate our operations in Alabama with the rest of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $13.9 million and includes $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Future restructuring costs associated with the Huntsville closure are expected to be minimal, unless actual proceeds from the sale of real estate in Huntsville are significantly different than our current estimates. Merger related business integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2002, totaled $2.3 million and were attributed to the restructuring and integration of the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen that are not part of the purchase price of the acquisition since the costs incurred benefit future operations of the combined companies. These costs are mainly comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. As of December 31, 2002, we had $3.5 million in accrued merger and restructuring related costs that are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the majority of which we expect to pay during the first six to nine months in 2003. 33 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $386.9 million, and reflects a net $329.7 million that was invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months. It also includes payments for capital expenditures and intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties) during the year ended December 31, 2002, which totaled $51.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities also includes a net $6.4 million paid for our acquisitions of InforMax and Serum Technologies Pty Limited, which reflects gross cash payments of $50.3 million less cash and cash equivalents acquired of $43.9 million. These net uses were offset by $1.1 million in cash received, net of cash sold, from the sale of our Serva subsidiary. For the year ending December 31, 2003, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate $50 million. We are offering for sale certain facilities in Frederick, Maryland and Huntsville, Alabama which became idle or excess as we have consolidated our operations. At December 31, 2002, we have $15.1 million recorded as assets held for sale for these facilities, which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In February 2003, we sold one of the Huntsville facilities for $2.7 million, which approximated the carrying value of the facility at December 31, 2002. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $92.9 million, and includes $94.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and $2.8 million used to reduce our outstanding line of credit balance in Japan to zero, offset by $5.0 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. In July 2002, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over the next three years. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost, in cash and accruals, of $100.0 million through December 31, 2002, which has been reported as a reduction in stockholders equity as Treasury Stock. The timing and price of future repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. Funds for the repurchase are expected to come primarily from cash generated from operations, or funds on hand. In December 2002, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of InforMax, Inc. (Nasdaq: INMX), for cash of $42.8 million. Direct costs incurred as a result of the acquisition were $5.5 million and $0.1 million was incurred as merger related business integration costs. We expect to incur an additional $0.9 million during the first six to nine months of 2003 for retention and relocation of employees. On February 4, 2003, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq:VRTX) to acquire the biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents, probes and proteins of PanVera LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertex, for $95.0 million in cash, subject to normal purchase conditions and adjustments. We also expect to assume debt and incur closing costs of approximately $10 million in connection with this transaction. The transaction is anticipated to close, subject to regulatory review, in the first or early second quarter of 2003. We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our molecular biology and cell culture platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a reduction in our current tax liability of $1.2 million representing the tax benefit for non qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of our common stock by employees during the year. This benefit is reflected as additional paid in capital in the December 31, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. During this same time period we also recognized a $4.5 million reduction in additional paid in capital and an offsetting increase in our taxes payable resulting from amendments to 2001 taxable income subsequent to 2001 for some employees as they provided changes to their taxable transaction survey letters. We have $500 million principal amount of 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 2 1/4% Convertible Notes, due 2006, outstanding at December 31, 2002. Interest on the 2 1/4% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 2 1/4% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of any holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 2 1/4% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount. 34 Table of Contents We also have $172.5 million principal amount of 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 5 1/2% Convertible Notes, due 2007, outstanding at December 31, 2002. Interest on the 5 1/2% Convertible Notes is payable semi annually on March 1st and September 1st. The 5 1/2% Convertible Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 2.0 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $85.20 per share. The 5 1/2% Convertible Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after March 1, 2003, at an initial premium of 103.143% of the principal amount. The premium declines annually to 100% of the principal amount of the notes at March 1, 2007. In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the 2 1/4% Convertible Notes and the 5 1/2% Convertible Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of $537.8 million, short term investments of $184.2 million, long term investments of $338.5 million and working capital of $818.1 million, excluding restricted cash and investments. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, corporate notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2002, foreign subsidiaries in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $6.3 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2002. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2002, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period Less than Years Years More than Total 1 Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt $ 674,575 $ 2,075 $ $ 672,500 $ Capital lease obligations 323 216 107 Operating lease obligations 62,346 13,026 19,130 13,415 16,775 Licensing and purchase obligations 44,875 16,615 18,503 8,798 959 Deferred compensation 1,487 165 1,322 Total $ 783,606 $ 32,097 $ 39,062 $ 694,713 $ 17,734 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. We recognize software license revenues in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 02, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended and interpreted. Our software sales generally consist of software license fees and maintenance fees. Software license fees are recognized as revenue when shipped, 35 Table of Contents under the residual method. We customarily include the maintenance renewal rate in the license arrangements. We recorded these maintenance fees as deferred revenue when the software is shipped and amortize the revenue on a straight line basis over the maintenance period which is typically one year. We recognize royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Where we receive a one time up front license fee, even though it may be non refundable, we generally record the payment as deferred revenue and amortize it into revenue over the life of the licensing contract. The portion of the up front fee that we defer or recognize is dependant on the terms of the agreement and the facts and circumstances specific to the contract, which include: our ongoing involvement and provision of services or product, milestones, the current market rate for royalties, our historical royalty rates imposed on similar licensing contracts, specific facts involved in the negotiation of the contract, and buy downs on annual royalty rates. Deferred revenue totaled $11.5 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $99.5 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.4 million at December 31, 2002. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Inventories were stated at $85.5 million at December 31, 2002. Valuation of goodwill. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became effective and as a result, we ceased amortization of goodwill. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an annual review for impairment. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required 36 Table of Contents if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we performed a transitional review for impairment of our goodwill as of January 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. SFAS No. 142 also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances. We also completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill on October 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. We cannot assure you that when we complete our annual or other periodic review for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $768.5 million at December 31, 2002. Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2002, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $336.7 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $136.2 million. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain 37 Table of Contents Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), and EITF Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $3.5 million at December 31, 2002, the majority of which we expect to pay during the first six to nine months of 2003. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon managements commitment to an exit plan, which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will impact the timing of exit or disposal costs reported by us after adoption. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $10.6 million at December 31, 2002. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Valuation of deferred income taxes. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by 38 Table of Contents the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our assets to our Molecular Biology and Cell Culture segments. We also do not report product line information as it would be impracticable to do so. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, which is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2003. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 145 will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon managements commitment to an exit plan, which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will impact the timing of exit or disposal costs reported by us after adoption. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 is an amendment to SFAS No. 123 providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. Amendments are effective for financial statements for the Company beginning January 1, 2003. The Company has currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. If the Company should choose to adopt such a method its implementation pursuant to SFAS No. 148 could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $648.6 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the prior year ended December 31, 2001 to our non U.S. revenues for 2002 results in revenues of $644.1 million. Therefore, as a result of the change in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, our 2002 revenues reported in U.S. dollars were positively affected by $4.5 million. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. To assist investors with the comparisons of our underlying business between currently reported periods, we have provided our revenue and growth rate results on a foreign currency comparable basis. 39 Table of Contents MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses in the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange losses recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $1.1 million, $1.5 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the Euro, British Pound sterling and Japanese Yen. We currently use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on non functional currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2002, we had $20.4 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which all settle on various dates through January 2003, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. We currently do not enter into financial contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk on transactions forecasted to arise beyond 30 days. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002, our cash equivalents and short term investments were invested primarily in securities with maturities of less than three months and, as a result, the fair value of these securities approximated carrying value due to their short term nature. The fair value of our long term investments, however, is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of our long term investments did not differ materially from carrying value. It is currently our intent to hold all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities until maturity, and, accordingly, their carrying values are not adjusted for changes in fair value. Thus, any potential changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates would not affect our financial position or results of operations. We would, however, be at risk for lower earnings should interest rates decline. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See discussion under Market Risk in Item 7.
