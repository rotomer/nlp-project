Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a leading supplier of kits, reagents, sera and cell media, and informatics software for life sciences research, drug discovery, and the production of biopharmaceuticals with sales of $778 million in 2003. We offer a full range of products that enable researchers to understand the molecular basis of life and potential mechanisms of disease, as well as identify attractive targets for drug development. Our products are also used to support the clinical development and commercial production of biopharmaceuticals. We focus our business on two principal segments: BioDiscovery, formerly named Molecular Biology. Our BioDiscovery product segment supplies a full range of reagents, kits and informatics to enable scientists to isolate, amplify, purify, identify, and characterize genes and their related proteins. Our kits comprise all the reagents necessary to perform a specific experiment and are optimized to simplify and improve the reliability and yield of such experiment. Scientists use our reagents and kits to elucidate the molecular basis of disease, identify disease targets for drug discovery, and understand the therapeutic mechanism of a drug. BioProduction, formerly named Cell Culture. Our BioProduction segment supplies a full range of mammalian sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents biologics testing and specialized manufacturing. These products provide the physiological conditions and nutrients necessary for cells to grow outside their native environment. The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions, and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, energy, agricultural and chemical companies. Life sciences researchers use our reagents and informatics to perform a broad range of experiments in the laboratory. The biopharmaceutical production market consists of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that use sera and media for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals include interferons, interleukins, t PA and monoclonal antibodies. The selection of sera and media generally occurs early in the clinical process and continues through commercialization. Other industries consume sera and media for the commercial production of genetically engineered products including food processing and agricultural industries. Our Strategy Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery and commercial bioproduction. Our strategies to achieve this objective include: New Product Innovation and Development. Developing innovative new products. We place a great emphasis on internally developing new technologies for the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical production markets. A significant portion of our growth and current revenue base has been created by the application of technology to accelerate the drug discovery process of our customers. We expect to increase research and development spending as a percentage of sales over the next several quarters, and to focus new product development on three critical technology areas: Protein production, purification and characterization; Biochemical and cell based assays; and Labeling and detection, particularly in proteomics. In licensing technologies. We actively and selectively in license new technologies, which we modify to create high value kits, many of which address bottlenecks in the research or drug discovery laboratories. We have a dedicated group of individuals that is focused on in licensing technologies from academic and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 26 Acquisitions. We actively and selectively seek to acquire and integrate companies with complementary products and technologies, trusted brand names, strong market positions, and strong intellectual property positions. We have acquired twelve companies since we became a public company in 1999. Our most significant acquisitions include Life Technologies, BioReliance, Molecular Probes, PanVera, NOVEX, Research Genetics and InforMax. Our significant acquisitions during the last year include: Our February 6, 2004, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of BioReliance Corporation. BioReliance is a leading contract service organization providing testing, development and manufacturing services for biologic based drugs to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The results of operations of BioReliance will be included in our consolidated financial statements in the BioProduction segment from the date of acquisition. Our August 20, 2003, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., a privately held corporation based in Eugene, Oregon. Molecular Probes is a provider of fluorescence based technologies for use in labeling molecules for biological research and drug discovery. The results of operations of Molecular Probes have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Our March 28, 2003, acquisition of products and technology rights from PanVera LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Based in Madison, Wisconsin, our PanVera business provides products and services that are designed to accelerate the discovery of new medicines by the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Through this transaction, we have acquired PanVeras biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and its commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents, probes and proteins. As part of the transaction, we have also acquired PanVeras research, development and manufacturing facility in Madison. We plan to expand the sale of PanVera products to target a broader market, including academic and government researchers. The results of operations of PanVera have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Our December 6, 2002, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of InforMax, Inc., a provider of a multi application suite of data access, analysis and presentation software for life science applications. The results of operations of InforMax have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Leverage of Existing Sales and Distribution Infrastructure Multi national sales footprint. We have developed what we consider to be a world class sales and distribution network with sales in approximately seventy countries throughout the world. Our sales force is highly trained, with many of our sales people possessing degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry or related fields. We believe our sales force has a proven track record for selling and distributing our products, and we expect to leverage this capacity to increase sales of our existing, newly developed and acquired products. We sell most of our products through our own sales force, and the remaining products are sold through agents or distributors. We currently market our products directly in over 24 countries throughout the world and sell through distributors or agents in approximately 45 additional countries. These independent distributors may also market research products for other companies, including some products that are competitive with our offerings. High customer satisfaction. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical support staffs work well together to provide our customers exceptional service for our products, and we have been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys. We expect to take advantage of this strength to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. Rapid product delivery. We have the ability to ship typical orders on a same day or next day basis. We intend to use this ability to provide convenient service to our customers to generate additional sales. Our BioDiscovery and BioProduction products are used for research purposes, and their use by our customers generally is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our BioProduction products and manufacturing sites, including some sites of our BioReliance subsidiary, are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations, which was formerly 27 known as current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, and is described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Carlsbad, California; Eugene, Oregon; Frederick and Rockville, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Auckland, New Zealand; Newcastle, Australia and Inchinnan, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in Japan, Brazil, and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We conduct research activities in the United States and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Except for our oligonucleotide, genomics services, biologics testing, specialized manufacturing, and cell culture production businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors that may Affect Future Results. In addition, our results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors and the mix of sales between distributors and our direct sales force. Although we have experienced growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that our growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Revenues. For the Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 Increase % Increase BioDiscovery segment revenues $ 500.5 $ 428.9 $ 71.6 17 % BioProduction segment revenues 277.2 219.7 57.5 26 % Total revenues $ 777.7 $ 648.6 $ 129.1 20 % BioDiscovery gross margin 68 % 62 % BioProduction gross margin 52 % 51 % Total gross margin 60 % 58 % When comparing 2003 revenues with 2002, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $40.6 million of the $129.1 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue growth rate by 6%. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 7%, from our recent acquisitions: InforMax, which we acquired in December 2002; the PanVera business which we acquired at the end of March 2003; and Molecular Probes which we acquired in August 2003. Higher volume accounted for an additional 3% increase, while higher prices contributed another 4%. 28 Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $24.1 million when comparing 2003 with 2002 and accounted for 6% of the 17% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 11%, from our recent acquisitions. We currently expect our BioDiscovery growth rate to range from 15% to 19% for 2004. BioProduction Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioProduction revenues by $16.5 million when comparing the year ended December 30, 2003, with 2002 and accounted for 8% of the 26% increase in revenues. The remainder of the increase reflects volume growth of 9% driven by our large scale production applications, as well as price increases, particularly for sera products, which accounted for 9%. We currently expect our BioProduction growth rate to range from 51% to 55% for 2004, with our acquisition of BioReliance in February 2004 contributing 43% of this growth. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. We also believe that it is unlikely for price increases for sera products to continue, and, therefore, do not anticipate that price increases will contribute to our growth rates or gross margin as much as they have in the past two years. Gross Margin. The increase in gross margin during 2003 when compared to 2002 reflects the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses during 2003, which accounted for improved margins of 2%, favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which accounted for improved margins of 1%, and higher prices which accounted for improved margins 1%. These margin improvements were offset by costs of $15.1 million, or 2%, associated with the sale during 2003 of products acquired in our business combinations that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2003 is due to favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which improved margins by 3%, the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses which accounted for improved margins of 2% and favorable changes in foreign currency rates which improved margins by 1%. Higher average selling prices increasing at a faster rate than costs in both our sera and non sera product lines accounted for a 3% improvement in BioProduction gross margin during 2003. Favorable changes in foreign currency rates improved margins by 1% and unfavorable changes in mix reduced gross margins by 2%. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements, and foreign currency rates. 29 Operating Expenses. For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues Increase BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 116.1 23 % $ 94.9 22 % $ 21.2 General and administrative 47.0 9 % 36.0 8 % 11.0 Research and development 46.6 9 % 27.8 6 % 18.8 BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 38.3 14 % $ 29.9 14 % $ 8.4 General and administrative 14.2 5 % 13.5 6 % 0.7 Research and development 7.7 3 % 5.9 3 % 1.8 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ General and administrative 27.5 21.6 5.9 Research and development 0.3 0.3 Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 154.5 20 % $ 124.9 19 % $ 29.6 General and administrative 88.7 11 % 71.1 11 % 17.6 Research and development 54.6 7 % 33.7 5 % 20.9 Sales and Marketing. The absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2003 is due to: expenses of our acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera, and Molecular Probes, which accounted for $10.6 million of the increase; increased headcount, compensation and selling activities which accounted for $12.8 million of the increase, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expense by $5.2 million. Sales and marketing expenses for 2003 also include accelerated depreciation expense of $1.1 million for a portion of our e commerce software that will be rendered obsolete by a new system in 2004. In the future we expect to reduce our sales and marketing expenditures as a percent of revenues. In addition, we plan to use product specialists to support our existing customer account managers allowing us to maintain the effectiveness of our direct selling organization while offering an ever increasing portfolio of products. General and Administrative. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses during 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase; higher legal costs of $4.4 million; costs associated with the transition in the chief executive officer position which accounted for $1.5 million; increased headcount and related spending and business insurance of $5.3 million, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $2.2 million. These costs are partially offset by cost reductions during 2003 of $2.8 million from the closure of our operations in Alabama in April 2002 and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. In the future, we plan on implementing programs and actions to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs will focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Research and Development. The increase in research and development expenses during 2003 reflects: software development costs for the InforMax business, research and development costs associated with Molecular Probes acquisition and the PanVera business acquired which in total accounted for $13.0 million of the increase; increased headcount and related spending as we continued to fill research and development positions in Carlsbad which accounted for $6.1 million of the increase and deferred compensation expense of $0.3 million from stock options assumed in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Research and development expenses for 2003 also include accelerated amortization of purchased technology of $1.5 million for which management has determined that there is limited opportunity to develop commercial applications. Additional catch up depreciation expense of $0.9 million was recognized in 2003 for a building that was removed from service in April 2002 and held for sale until November 2003 30 when our strategy changed to reactivate the facility for research and development activities. Higher expense for grants accounted for another $0.5 million increase for 2003. These increases were partially offset by the closure of our Alabama facility and the sale of our Serva entity which reduced research and development costs by $1.5 million in 2003. We expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues will continue to increase as we expand our capabilities to accelerate innovation. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $79.4 million for 2003, and $64.3 million for 2002. The increase in 2003 is due primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes acquisitions. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. Purchased in process research and development costs of $1.4 million for 2003 resulted from the Molecular Probes acquisition and represent acquired current research and development projects in process. Business Integration Costs. Merger related business integration costs for 2003 were $1.3 million and represent an additional impairment loss of $0.9 million on assets held for sale in Huntsville, Alabama, related to the closure of our facilities located there in addition to $0.4 million in costs incurred for the integration of InforMax, acquired in December 2002. These costs were for the relocation of property, closure of facilities and retention of employees. Business integration costs for 2002 were $16.2 million and include $13.9 million from the integration of our Alabama operations with the rest of the company. The integration costs include $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Business integration costs for 2002 also include costs for restructuring and integrating the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen which are comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. We do not expect any future restructuring costs associated with InforMax or the Huntsville closure, unless actual proceeds from the sale of real estate in Huntsville are significantly different than our current estimates. Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $3.4 million from $27.4 million for 2002, to $24.0 million for 2003. The reduction in interest income is due mainly to lower interest rates. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances which could be materially reduced by acquisitions and other financing activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.5 million from $24.1 million for 2002 to $28.6 million for 2003. Our issuance of $350 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes in August 2003 increased interest expense by $3.1 million for 2003. The remainder of the increase in 2003 was due mainly to $0.7 million of imputed interest on unfavorable lease obligations acquired in the InforMax acquisition and interest expense of $0.4 million on our capital lease obligation acquired in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Our interest expense will increase during 2004 for interest incurred on the 1.5% convertible notes issued in February 2004, the 2% convertible notes issued in August 2003, and the Molecular Probes capital lease obligation. These increases will be partially offset by our redemption of our 5% convertible notes in March 2004. 31 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2003 and 2002, is comprised of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Net periodic pension income (expense)(1) $ (0.5 ) $ 1.3 Gain (loss) on the sale of our Serva subsidiary(2) 0.9 (0.5 ) Gain on sale of an investment 0.3 Impairment loss on vacant land (0.6 ) Loss on the sale of our Indian subsidiary (0.3 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 0.1 (1.1 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 0.2 $ (0.6 ) (1) The net periodic pension income and expense is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of Invitrogen. (2) The gain was recognized in June 2003 on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, which was sold in 2002, resulting from the collection of cash on a note receivable from the sale that was fully reserved for at the time of the sale. The anticipated redemption in March 2004, of our $172.5 million principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, due 2007, at a premium of 102.357% is expected to result in a charge to other income and expense at the time of redemption of $6.7 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized deferred debt costs. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 28.6% for 2003 compared with 31.2% for 2002. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to additional tax credits for research expenditures incurred in 2003 and an increase in the proportion of income earned in tax jurisdictions having lower tax rates. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Revenues. For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase(Decrease) % Increase (dollars in millions) 2002 2001 BioDiscovery segment revenues $ 428.9 $ 409.4 $ 19.5 5 % BioProduction segment revenues 219.7 219.9 (0.2 ) Total revenues $ 648.6 $ 629.3 $ 19.3 3 % BioDiscovery gross margin 62 % 61 % BioProduction gross margin 51 % 44 % Total gross margin 58 % 55 % Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, when comparing 2002 with 2001, increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $4.5 million of the $19.3 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates also increased our revenue growth rate by 1%. Subsequent to the merger with Life Technologies that occurred in September 2000, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Sales of these products were $3.9 million in 2002, down from $42.0 million for 2001, and reduced our revenue growth rate by 6%. Higher prices accounted for an additional 7% increase, while higher volume contributed another 2%. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. The $428.9 million of BioDiscovery revenues in 2002 includes $3.2 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $12.1 million sold in the same period last year, reducing the BioDiscovery segment revenue growth rate by 2%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $2.7 million when comparing 2002 with the same period in 2001, and increased the BioDiscovery revenue growth rate by 1%. Higher prices accounted for the rest of the 6% net increase in revenue growth during 2002, while the overall net contribution to sales from volume was essentially flat. BioProduction Segment Revenues. The $219.7 million of BioProduction revenues for 2002 includes $0.7 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $29.9 million of these products sold in 2001, which included revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001, and, overall, reduced the BioProduction revenue growth rate by 13%. 32 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2002 increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues by $1.8 million, and increased the BioProduction revenue growth rate by 1%. Higher prices, mainly for our sera products, and higher volume accounted for an additional 8% and 4% increase, respectively, in revenue growth. Gross Margin. Higher selling prices in 2002 and lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued BioProduction products, accounted for increases in margin in 2002 of 3% and 2%, respectively. Unfavorable changes in product mix during 2002 reduced gross margin by 1%. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2002 is due to higher selling prices and lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued products which improved margin by 2% and 1%, respectively. Unfavorable changes in product mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates offset these improvements by 1%. Higher average selling prices for our BioProduction products, particularly our sera products, accounted for a 4% improvement in gross margin during 2002. Lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued products improved margin by another 2%. Operating Expenses. For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues Increase(Decrease) BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 94.9 22 % $ 83.9 20 % $ 11.0 General and administrative 36.0 8 % 39.2 10 % (3.2 ) Research and development 27.8 6 % 32.9 8 % (5.1 ) BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 29.9 14 % $ 28.4 13 % $ 1.5 General and administrative 13.5 6 % 11.9 5 % 1.6 Research and development 5.9 3 % 5.0 2 % 0.9 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.1 $ 0.5 $ (0.4 ) General and administrative 21.6 14.6 7.0 Research and development 0.2 (0.2 ) Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 124.9 19 % $ 112.8 18 % $ 12.1 General and administrative 71.1 11 % 65.7 10 % 5.4 Research and development 33.7 5 % 38.1 6 % (4.4 ) Sales and Marketing. Increased headcount, benefit costs and promotional spending, including our InforMax acquisition in December 2002, accounted for $13.5 million of the $12.1 million increase. This increase was partially offset by $1.0 million from expense reductions resulting from the closure of our Alabama location in April 2002 and the sales of our BioSepra and Serva entities in July 2001 and June 2002, respectively. Lower deferred compensation accounted for the remaining $0.4 million reduction in expense during 2002. General and Administrative. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses is due to: $7.3 million from increased headcount, benefit costs, and related spending, including our InforMax acquisition; $2.4 million in costs associated with the retirement of our chief executive officer, and $1.1 million in costs to purchase the rights to change in control agreements from four key management members. These higher expenses were partially offset by $4.1 million in cost reductions from the closure of our operations in Alabama and the sales of our BioSepra and Serva entities, and lower deferred compensation expense of $1.3 million. Research and Development. The decrease in research and development expenses reflects unfilled research and development positions as we transitioned these positions from our Maryland facilities to California during 2001, which accounted for $2.7 million in lower costs, the closure of our operations in Alabama and the sales of our BioSepra and Serva entities, which accounted for another 33 $3.1 million in cost reductions. The lower costs were partially offset by higher spending on a genome project in 2002 of approximately $1.3 million. Goodwill Amortization. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. The adoption of these statements also resulted in the reclassification of the net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, to goodwill. Amortization expense for goodwill for 2001 totaled $175.7 million. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $64.3 million for 2002 and $90.5 million for 2001. The reduction in expense from 2001 to 2002 is due to; one intangible asset that became fully amortized in September 2001 which accounted for a $19.7 million reduction in 2002; the reclassification of the assembled workforce intangible to goodwill in 2002 which accounted for a $4.8 million reduction; the assignment of an indefinite life under SFAS No. 142 to the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks allocated to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001, and accounted for an additional $1.0 million reduction in amortization expense as this intangible is no longer amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Business Integration Costs. Business integration costs for 2002, were $16.2 million and include $13.9 million from the integration of our Alabama operations with the rest of the company. The integration costs include $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Business integration costs for 2002 also include costs for restructuring and integrating the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen which are comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. Business integrations costs for 2001, totaled $11.3 million and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen. These costs are mainly comprised of $7.0 million in retention, severance and relocation costs as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California, $1.8 million in costs to exit distributor contracts, $1.6 million in business reorganization consulting fees and $0.7 million in product catalogue obsolescence. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $7.1 million from $20.3 million for 2001, to $27.4 million for 2002. The increase during 2002 was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during 2002, partially offset by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2002. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $12.8 million from $11.3 million for 2001, to $24.1 million for 2002. The increase in 2002 was due mainly to interest on the 2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 2002 and 2001, is comprised of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2002 2001 Net periodic pension income(1) $ 1.3 $ 2.5 Loss on the sale of our Serva subsidiary (0.5 ) Loss on the sale of our Indian subsidiary (0.3 ) Gain on sale of a product line 1.2 Gain on sale of a European facility 1.0 Gain on sale of our BioSepra subsidiary 0.4 Net foreign currency exchange losses (1.1 ) (1.5 ) Other 0.7 Total other income (expense), net $ (0.6 ) $ 4.3 (1) The net periodic pension income is from an defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of Invitrogen. 34 Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 31.2% for 2002 and a negative 6.8% in 2001. The change from 2001 was primarily attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Such amortization was non deductible for tax purposes. For 2001, a $9.3 million tax provision was provided on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in pre tax income are certain business integration costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that provide financial reporting tax benefits at rates higher than our effective tax rate for all other pre tax income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash of $168.1 million during 2003 primarily from our net income of $60.1 million plus net non cash charges of $107.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net $0.2 million of cash during the period, driven primarily by a decrease in inventories, which excludes the initial purchase of inventories from business combinations, and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities for compensation related accruals, interest and legal accruals. These sources of cash were reduced by $13.6 million that was paid to settle a claim with the Veterans Administration that was acquired in connection with our acquisition of Life Technologies in 2000. As a result of the examination by the IRS concluded in 2003, Invitrogen adjusted deferred tax liabilities from $6.0 million to $27.7 million related to the undistributed earnings on a group of foreign subsidiaries that arose prior to their acquisition by Invitrogen. Such pre acquisition earnings are not considered to be permanently invested in those operations. The effect of the adjustment was to increase goodwill by $21.7 million. This deferred tax liability is included in long term deferred income tax liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003, and will be payable at the time we choose to distribute these earnings. As a result of working capital improvement programs currently being developed we expect to utilize more efficiently our working capital in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal, and, on an interim basis during the year, may require short term working capital needs. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2003, was $508.4 million, and reflects a net $422.8 million paid for our business acquisitions, a net $55.5 million invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months and payments for capital expenditures and intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties), which totaled $32.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. These uses were offset by $2.7 million in cash received from the sale of one of our Huntsville facilities. For 2004, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate $35 million. On August 20, 2003, we completed our acquisition of the common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., for cash of $307.3 million. We also paid $2.4 million in closing costs, $3.3 million in severance costs and acquired cash totaling $7.3 million. On March 28, 2003, we completed our acquisition of products and technology rights of PanVera for $94.9 million in cash and the assumption of $6.3 million in debt, which we subsequently paid off in May 2003. As part of the transaction, we have also acquired PanVeras research and development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Other cash costs in connection with this transaction include $1.3 million paid to buy out operating leases to acquire equipment and $1.5 million in closing costs. In 2003, we entered into three small business combinations, one of which included the acquisition of the remaining 60% ownership in a consolidated subsidiary. The purchases totaled $9.8 million in addition to the return of the selling partners capital account for the 60% interest described above. Beginning in July 2003 we no longer report a minority interest adjustment in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Pursuant to the purchase agreement for one of these acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on certain operating results of the acquired company. Over the next four years, payments aggregating a maximum of $4.0 million and certain other payments based upon percentages of future gross sales of the acquired company could be required. We will account for any such contingent payments as an addition to the purchase price With the acquisition of the InforMax business in December 2002, we acquired certain leased properties which we are no longer using in our operations. We have included the full value of these lease obligations, net of sublease income, discounted at 8%, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2003, $1.1 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $5.5 million is included in long term obligations, deferred credits and reserves. Our current annual obligation under these leases, before sublease income, is approximately $2.0 million. We are continuing our efforts to sublease these properties or otherwise reduce these lease obligations. During 2003 we paid $3.1 million to terminate some of these lease obligations. 35 We are offering for sale certain facilities in Huntsville, Alabama which became idle or excess as we have consolidated our operations. At December 31, 2003, we have $1.5 million recorded as assets held for sale for these facilities, which we expect to sell within the next twelve months and have included this amount in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On February 6, 2004, we acquired all of the common stock and outstanding debt of BioReliance Corporation for an estimated total cash purchase price of $433 million, plus the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $70 million. The purchase price was paid from existing cash and investments. Effective December 31, 2003, based upon a reevaluation of funding for our acquisition strategies, we changed our intent from holding our marketable securities to maturity, to holding our securities as available for sale. The change resulted in a reclassification of $579.3 million from securities classified as held to maturity to securities held available for sale and the recognition of net unrealized gains of $1.2 million in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $364.2 million for 2003, and includes $340.7 million in net proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes in August 2003 and $35.3 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. This net cash provided was offset by $5.4 million used to pay off remaining accruals as trades settled on our common stock shares that were repurchased at the end of 2002, $4.1 million used to return a selling partners capital account and $2.1 million used to pay off our bonds payable to the State Industrial Development Authority of Alabama. On February 19, 2004, we issued $450 million principal amount of 1% Convertible Senior Notes, or 1% Notes, due 2024, to certain qualified institutional buyers. In March 2004, we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this debt to redeem our 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 5% Notes, due 2007, in the aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million at a premium of 102.357%, plus accrued interest. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including potential redemption or repayment of other outstanding debt. After expenses, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $440.7 million. Interest on the 1% Notes is payable semi annually on February 15th and August 15th. In addition to the coupon interest of 1%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The 1% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 4.4 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $102.03 per share. The 1% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after February 15, 2012, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the 1% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the 1% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on February 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022. Invitrogen has also granted an option to the initial purchasers of the notes to purchase by March 3, 2004, up to an additional $67.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The anticipated redemption in March 2004, of our $172.5 million principal amount of 5% Notes, due 2007, outstanding at December 31, 2003, at a premium of 102.357% is expected to result in a charge to other income and expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations of $6.7 million for the call premium and the write of unamortized deferred debt costs. Interest on the 5% Notes is currently payable semi annually on March 1st and September 1st. The 5% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 2.0 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $85.20 per share. The 5% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and, through February 28, 2005, at an initial premium of 102.357% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The premium declines annually each March 1st thereafter to 100% of the principal amount of the notes at March 1, 2007. In August 2003, we issued $350 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes, or 2% Notes, due August 1, 2023, to certain qualified institutional buyers. The issuance of this debt was used to finance our acquisition of Molecular Probes in August 2003. After expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $340.9 million. Interest on the 2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 1st and August 1st. In addition to the coupon interest of 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning August 1, 2010, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.1 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $68.24 per share. The 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after August 1, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the 2% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the 2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2013, and August 1, 2018. 36 We have $500 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 2% Notes, due 2006, outstanding at December 31, 2003. Interest on the 2% Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of any holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the 2% Notes, the 2% Notes and the 5% Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over a three year period ending in 2005. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost, in cash and accruals, of $100.0 million during 2002, which has been reported as a reduction in stockholders equity as Treasury Stock. During 2003 no shares were repurchased. The timing and price of future repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. Funds for any future repurchases are expected to come primarily from cash generated from operations, or funds on hand. We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery and BioProduction platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of $588.7 million, short term investments of $403.4 million and long term investments of $177.1 million. Our working capital totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2003, and includes restricted cash and investments of $6.6 million. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, corporate notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2003, foreign subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $5.9 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2003. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2003, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 Years Long term debt(1) $ 1,024,362 $ 862 $ 500,000 $ 173,500 $ 350,000 Capital lease obligations 24,006 1,606 2,883 2,838 16,679 Operating lease obligations 57,659 10,870 16,978 10,621 19,190 Licensing and purchase obligations 32,014 14,804 12,751 3,750 709 Deferred compensation 2,141 415 768 227 731 Total $ 1,140,182 $ 28,557 $ 533,380 $ 190,936 $ 387,309 (1) In February 2004 we issued $450 million principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, due 2024. In March 2004, we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this debt to redeem our Notes due 2007 in the aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million at a premium of 102.357%, plus accrued interest. 37 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $11.7 million at December 31, 2003. We recognize royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and or remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $10.7 million, $5.7 million and $5.2 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the financial condition of that customer or in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $121.2 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.1 million at December 31, 2003. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Gross inventories were stated at $153.4 million at December 31, 2003, and include $17.6 million in purchase accounting adjustments to write up acquired inventory to fair value. Reserves for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory were $26.7 million at December 31, 2003. Valuation of goodwill. We are required to perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; 38 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. We completed our recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2003, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Our evaluation included management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review from July 2003. Key assumptions from this strategic review included revenue growth, with higher net income growth. This growth was based on increased sales of new products as we expect to increase our investment in research and development, the full year effect and growth from business acquisitions already consummated, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Additional value creators assumed included increased efficiencies in working capital as well as increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 12%. Operating mechanisms to ensure that these growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized were also proposed as part of the internal strategic review and considered in our evaluation. Our market capitalization at October 1, 2003, was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis. We cannot assure you that when we complete our future annual or other periodic reviews for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $983.4 million at December 31, 2003. Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2003, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $457.2 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $186.2 million. 39 Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $0.8 million at December 31, 2003, the majority of which we expect to pay during the first three months of 2004. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter, which was acquired in 2000. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $10.3 million at December 31, 2003. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. See discussion under Recent Accounting Pronouncements below. Income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we 40 do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our assets to our BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments. We also do not report product line information as it would be impracticable to do so. Pro forma Stock Based Compensation. We provide pro forma net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share amounts in accordance with the disclosure only provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The stock based compensation expense used in these pro forma amounts is based on the fair value of the option at the grant date which uses the present value pricing method described in SFAS No. 123. This method requires us to use several assumptions to estimate the fair value, including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected life. Should any of these assumptions change or differ from the actual life or actual stock price volatility, our pro forma results could differ substantially. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88 and 106, and a revision of SFAS No. 132. The statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after December 15, 2003. This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS No. 87, 88 and 106. The new rules require additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The required information has been provided separately for Invitrogens pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans (see note 10). The adoption of this Statement did not have an impact on Invitrogens consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 1 (FSP 106 1), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The guidance is effective for initial interim or annual fiscal periods ending after December 7, 2003. FSP 106 1 permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans (plan sponsors) that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Without FSP 106 1, plan sponsors would be required under SFAS No. 106 to account for the effects of the Act in the fiscal period that includes December 8, 2003, the date the President signed the Act into law. Invitrogen has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. As a result of this, measurement of the accumulated plan benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in note 10 does not reflect the effects of the Act on Invitrogens postretirement benefit plan. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance, when issued, could require Invitrogen to change previously reported information on the disclosure of its Dexter Postretirement Health and Benefit Program in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $777.7 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2002 to our non U.S. revenues for 2003 would result in $40.6 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. To assist investors with the comparisons of our underlying business between currently reported periods, we have provided our revenue and growth rate results on a foreign currency comparable basis. 41 MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $0.1 million, ($1.1) million and ($1.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2003, we had $43.8 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which all settled on various dates through January 2004, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. In January 2004 we expanded our foreign currency hedging program to include hedging of forecasted foreign currency cash flows and executed forward contracts having a gross U.S. dollar value at the time of execution of $198.5 million. The contracts mature on various dates through 2004. The contracts increase or decrease in value prior to their maturity will be accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent any portion of the forward contracts is determined to not be an effective hedge, the increase or decrease in value prior to the maturity will be recorded in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2003, we had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $720.2 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2003, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would, however, decrease or increase, respectively, the remaining $446.9 million of our investments by approximately $5.1 million. While changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a leading supplier of kits, reagents, sera and cell media, and informatics software for life sciences research, drug discovery, and the production of biopharmaceuticals with sales of $778 million in 2003. We offer a full range of products that enable researchers to understand the molecular basis of life and potential mechanisms of disease, as well as identify attractive targets for drug development. Our products are also used to support the clinical development and commercial production of biopharmaceuticals. We focus our business on two principal segments: BioDiscovery, formerly named Molecular Biology. Our BioDiscovery product segment supplies a full range of reagents, kits and informatics to enable scientists to isolate, amplify, purify, identify, and characterize genes and their related proteins. Our kits comprise all the reagents necessary to perform a specific experiment and are optimized to simplify and improve the reliability and yield of such experiment. Scientists use our reagents and kits to elucidate the molecular basis of disease, identify disease targets for drug discovery, and understand the therapeutic mechanism of a drug. BioProduction, formerly named Cell Culture. Our BioProduction segment supplies a full range of mammalian sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents biologics testing and specialized manufacturing. These products provide the physiological conditions and nutrients necessary for cells to grow outside their native environment. The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions, and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, energy, agricultural and chemical companies. Life sciences researchers use our reagents and informatics to perform a broad range of experiments in the laboratory. The biopharmaceutical production market consists of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that use sera and media for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals include interferons, interleukins, t PA and monoclonal antibodies. The selection of sera and media generally occurs early in the clinical process and continues through commercialization. Other industries consume sera and media for the commercial production of genetically engineered products including food processing and agricultural industries. Our Strategy Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery and commercial bioproduction. Our strategies to achieve this objective include: New Product Innovation and Development. Developing innovative new products. We place a great emphasis on internally developing new technologies for the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical production markets. A significant portion of our growth and current revenue base has been created by the application of technology to accelerate the drug discovery process of our customers. We expect to increase research and development spending as a percentage of sales over the next several quarters, and to focus new product development on three critical technology areas: Protein production, purification and characterization; Biochemical and cell based assays; and Labeling and detection, particularly in proteomics. In licensing technologies. We actively and selectively in license new technologies, which we modify to create high value kits, many of which address bottlenecks in the research or drug discovery laboratories. We have a dedicated group of individuals that is focused on in licensing technologies from academic and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 26 Acquisitions. We actively and selectively seek to acquire and integrate companies with complementary products and technologies, trusted brand names, strong market positions, and strong intellectual property positions. We have acquired twelve companies since we became a public company in 1999. Our most significant acquisitions include Life Technologies, BioReliance, Molecular Probes, PanVera, NOVEX, Research Genetics and InforMax. Our significant acquisitions during the last year include: Our February 6, 2004, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of BioReliance Corporation. BioReliance is a leading contract service organization providing testing, development and manufacturing services for biologic based drugs to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The results of operations of BioReliance will be included in our consolidated financial statements in the BioProduction segment from the date of acquisition. Our August 20, 2003, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., a privately held corporation based in Eugene, Oregon. Molecular Probes is a provider of fluorescence based technologies for use in labeling molecules for biological research and drug discovery. The results of operations of Molecular Probes have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Our March 28, 2003, acquisition of products and technology rights from PanVera LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Based in Madison, Wisconsin, our PanVera business provides products and services that are designed to accelerate the discovery of new medicines by the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Through this transaction, we have acquired PanVeras biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and its commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents, probes and proteins. As part of the transaction, we have also acquired PanVeras research, development and manufacturing facility in Madison. We plan to expand the sale of PanVera products to target a broader market, including academic and government researchers. The results of operations of PanVera have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Our December 6, 2002, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of InforMax, Inc., a provider of a multi application suite of data access, analysis and presentation software for life science applications. The results of operations of InforMax have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Leverage of Existing Sales and Distribution Infrastructure Multi national sales footprint. We have developed what we consider to be a world class sales and distribution network with sales in approximately seventy countries throughout the world. Our sales force is highly trained, with many of our sales people possessing degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry or related fields. We believe our sales force has a proven track record for selling and distributing our products, and we expect to leverage this capacity to increase sales of our existing, newly developed and acquired products. We sell most of our products through our own sales force, and the remaining products are sold through agents or distributors. We currently market our products directly in over 24 countries throughout the world and sell through distributors or agents in approximately 45 additional countries. These independent distributors may also market research products for other companies, including some products that are competitive with our offerings. High customer satisfaction. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical support staffs work well together to provide our customers exceptional service for our products, and we have been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys. We expect to take advantage of this strength to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. Rapid product delivery. We have the ability to ship typical orders on a same day or next day basis. We intend to use this ability to provide convenient service to our customers to generate additional sales. Our BioDiscovery and BioProduction products are used for research purposes, and their use by our customers generally is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our BioProduction products and manufacturing sites, including some sites of our BioReliance subsidiary, are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations, which was formerly 27 known as current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, and is described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Carlsbad, California; Eugene, Oregon; Frederick and Rockville, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Auckland, New Zealand; Newcastle, Australia and Inchinnan, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in Japan, Brazil, and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We conduct research activities in the United States and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Except for our oligonucleotide, genomics services, biologics testing, specialized manufacturing, and cell culture production businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors that may Affect Future Results. In addition, our results of operations could be affected by the timing of orders from distributors and the mix of sales between distributors and our direct sales force. Although we have experienced growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or that our growth will be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Revenues. For the Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 Increase % Increase BioDiscovery segment revenues $ 500.5 $ 428.9 $ 71.6 17 % BioProduction segment revenues 277.2 219.7 57.5 26 % Total revenues $ 777.7 $ 648.6 $ 129.1 20 % BioDiscovery gross margin 68 % 62 % BioProduction gross margin 52 % 51 % Total gross margin 60 % 58 % When comparing 2003 revenues with 2002, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $40.6 million of the $129.1 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue growth rate by 6%. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 7%, from our recent acquisitions: InforMax, which we acquired in December 2002; the PanVera business which we acquired at the end of March 2003; and Molecular Probes which we acquired in August 2003. Higher volume accounted for an additional 3% increase, while higher prices contributed another 4%. 28 Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $24.1 million when comparing 2003 with 2002 and accounted for 6% of the 17% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 11%, from our recent acquisitions. We currently expect our BioDiscovery growth rate to range from 15% to 19% for 2004. BioProduction Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioProduction revenues by $16.5 million when comparing the year ended December 30, 2003, with 2002 and accounted for 8% of the 26% increase in revenues. The remainder of the increase reflects volume growth of 9% driven by our large scale production applications, as well as price increases, particularly for sera products, which accounted for 9%. We currently expect our BioProduction growth rate to range from 51% to 55% for 2004, with our acquisition of BioReliance in February 2004 contributing 43% of this growth. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. We also believe that it is unlikely for price increases for sera products to continue, and, therefore, do not anticipate that price increases will contribute to our growth rates or gross margin as much as they have in the past two years. Gross Margin. The increase in gross margin during 2003 when compared to 2002 reflects the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses during 2003, which accounted for improved margins of 2%, favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which accounted for improved margins of 1%, and higher prices which accounted for improved margins 1%. These margin improvements were offset by costs of $15.1 million, or 2%, associated with the sale during 2003 of products acquired in our business combinations that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2003 is due to favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which improved margins by 3%, the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses which accounted for improved margins of 2% and favorable changes in foreign currency rates which improved margins by 1%. Higher average selling prices increasing at a faster rate than costs in both our sera and non sera product lines accounted for a 3% improvement in BioProduction gross margin during 2003. Favorable changes in foreign currency rates improved margins by 1% and unfavorable changes in mix reduced gross margins by 2%. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements, and foreign currency rates. 29 Operating Expenses. For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues Increase BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 116.1 23 % $ 94.9 22 % $ 21.2 General and administrative 47.0 9 % 36.0 8 % 11.0 Research and development 46.6 9 % 27.8 6 % 18.8 BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 38.3 14 % $ 29.9 14 % $ 8.4 General and administrative 14.2 5 % 13.5 6 % 0.7 Research and development 7.7 3 % 5.9 3 % 1.8 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ General and administrative 27.5 21.6 5.9 Research and development 0.3 0.3 Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 154.5 20 % $ 124.9 19 % $ 29.6 General and administrative 88.7 11 % 71.1 11 % 17.6 Research and development 54.6 7 % 33.7 5 % 20.9 Sales and Marketing. The absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2003 is due to: expenses of our acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera, and Molecular Probes, which accounted for $10.6 million of the increase; increased headcount, compensation and selling activities which accounted for $12.8 million of the increase, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expense by $5.2 million. Sales and marketing expenses for 2003 also include accelerated depreciation expense of $1.1 million for a portion of our e commerce software that will be rendered obsolete by a new system in 2004. In the future we expect to reduce our sales and marketing expenditures as a percent of revenues. In addition, we plan to use product specialists to support our existing customer account managers allowing us to maintain the effectiveness of our direct selling organization while offering an ever increasing portfolio of products. General and Administrative. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses during 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase; higher legal costs of $4.4 million; costs associated with the transition in the chief executive officer position which accounted for $1.5 million; increased headcount and related spending and business insurance of $5.3 million, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $2.2 million. These costs are partially offset by cost reductions during 2003 of $2.8 million from the closure of our operations in Alabama in April 2002 and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. In the future, we plan on implementing programs and actions to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs will focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Research and Development. The increase in research and development expenses during 2003 reflects: software development costs for the InforMax business, research and development costs associated with Molecular Probes acquisition and the PanVera business acquired which in total accounted for $13.0 million of the increase; increased headcount and related spending as we continued to fill research and development positions in Carlsbad which accounted for $6.1 million of the increase and deferred compensation expense of $0.3 million from stock options assumed in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Research and development expenses for 2003 also include accelerated amortization of purchased technology of $1.5 million for which management has determined that there is limited opportunity to develop commercial applications. Additional catch up depreciation expense of $0.9 million was recognized in 2003 for a building that was removed from service in April 2002 and held for sale until November 2003 30 when our strategy changed to reactivate the facility for research and development activities. Higher expense for grants accounted for another $0.5 million increase for 2003. These increases were partially offset by the closure of our Alabama facility and the sale of our Serva entity which reduced research and development costs by $1.5 million in 2003. We expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues will continue to increase as we expand our capabilities to accelerate innovation. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $79.4 million for 2003, and $64.3 million for 2002. The increase in 2003 is due primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes acquisitions. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. Purchased in process research and development costs of $1.4 million for 2003 resulted from the Molecular Probes acquisition and represent acquired current research and development projects in process. Business Integration Costs. Merger related business integration costs for 2003 were $1.3 million and represent an additional impairment loss of $0.9 million on assets held for sale in Huntsville, Alabama, related to the closure of our facilities located there in addition to $0.4 million in costs incurred for the integration of InforMax, acquired in December 2002. These costs were for the relocation of property, closure of facilities and retention of employees. Business integration costs for 2002 were $16.2 million and include $13.9 million from the integration of our Alabama operations with the rest of the company. The integration costs include $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Business integration costs for 2002 also include costs for restructuring and integrating the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen which are comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. We do not expect any future restructuring costs associated with InforMax or the Huntsville closure, unless actual proceeds from the sale of real estate in Huntsville are significantly different than our current estimates. Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $3.4 million from $27.4 million for 2002, to $24.0 million for 2003. The reduction in interest income is due mainly to lower interest rates. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances which could be materially reduced by acquisitions and other financing activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.5 million from $24.1 million for 2002 to $28.6 million for 2003. Our issuance of $350 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes in August 2003 increased interest expense by $3.1 million for 2003. The remainder of the increase in 2003 was due mainly to $0.7 million of imputed interest on unfavorable lease obligations acquired in the InforMax acquisition and interest expense of $0.4 million on our capital lease obligation acquired in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Our interest expense will increase during 2004 for interest incurred on the 1.5% convertible notes issued in February 2004, the 2% convertible notes issued in August 2003, and the Molecular Probes capital lease obligation. These increases will be partially offset by our redemption of our 5% convertible notes in March 2004. 31 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2003 and 2002, is comprised of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Net periodic pension income (expense)(1) $ (0.5 ) $ 1.3 Gain (loss) on the sale of our Serva subsidiary(2) 0.9 (0.5 ) Gain on sale of an investment 0.3 Impairment loss on vacant land (0.6 ) Loss on the sale of our Indian subsidiary (0.3 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 0.1 (1.1 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 0.2 $ (0.6 ) (1) The net periodic pension income and expense is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of Invitrogen. (2) The gain was recognized in June 2003 on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, which was sold in 2002, resulting from the collection of cash on a note receivable from the sale that was fully reserved for at the time of the sale. The anticipated redemption in March 2004, of our $172.5 million principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, due 2007, at a premium of 102.357% is expected to result in a charge to other income and expense at the time of redemption of $6.7 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized deferred debt costs. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 28.6% for 2003 compared with 31.2% for 2002. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to additional tax credits for research expenditures incurred in 2003 and an increase in the proportion of income earned in tax jurisdictions having lower tax rates. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Revenues. For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase(Decrease) % Increase (dollars in millions) 2002 2001 BioDiscovery segment revenues $ 428.9 $ 409.4 $ 19.5 5 % BioProduction segment revenues 219.7 219.9 (0.2 ) Total revenues $ 648.6 $ 629.3 $ 19.3 3 % BioDiscovery gross margin 62 % 61 % BioProduction gross margin 51 % 44 % Total gross margin 58 % 55 % Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, when comparing 2002 with 2001, increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $4.5 million of the $19.3 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates also increased our revenue growth rate by 1%. Subsequent to the merger with Life Technologies that occurred in September 2000, we discontinued the sale of some products that were low growth, low volume and or low gross margin. Sales of these products were $3.9 million in 2002, down from $42.0 million for 2001, and reduced our revenue growth rate by 6%. Higher prices accounted for an additional 7% increase, while higher volume contributed another 2%. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. The $428.9 million of BioDiscovery revenues in 2002 includes $3.2 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $12.1 million sold in the same period last year, reducing the BioDiscovery segment revenue growth rate by 2%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $2.7 million when comparing 2002 with the same period in 2001, and increased the BioDiscovery revenue growth rate by 1%. Higher prices accounted for the rest of the 6% net increase in revenue growth during 2002, while the overall net contribution to sales from volume was essentially flat. BioProduction Segment Revenues. The $219.7 million of BioProduction revenues for 2002 includes $0.7 million of revenues from the sale of products that were divested or discontinued, down from $29.9 million of these products sold in 2001, which included revenues from our BioSepra business that was sold in July 2001, and, overall, reduced the BioProduction revenue growth rate by 13%. 32 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2002 increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues by $1.8 million, and increased the BioProduction revenue growth rate by 1%. Higher prices, mainly for our sera products, and higher volume accounted for an additional 8% and 4% increase, respectively, in revenue growth. Gross Margin. Higher selling prices in 2002 and lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued BioProduction products, accounted for increases in margin in 2002 of 3% and 2%, respectively. Unfavorable changes in product mix during 2002 reduced gross margin by 1%. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2002 is due to higher selling prices and lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued products which improved margin by 2% and 1%, respectively. Unfavorable changes in product mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates offset these improvements by 1%. Higher average selling prices for our BioProduction products, particularly our sera products, accounted for a 4% improvement in gross margin during 2002. Lower sales in 2002 of low margin, discontinued products improved margin by another 2%. Operating Expenses. For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues Increase(Decrease) BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 94.9 22 % $ 83.9 20 % $ 11.0 General and administrative 36.0 8 % 39.2 10 % (3.2 ) Research and development 27.8 6 % 32.9 8 % (5.1 ) BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 29.9 14 % $ 28.4 13 % $ 1.5 General and administrative 13.5 6 % 11.9 5 % 1.6 Research and development 5.9 3 % 5.0 2 % 0.9 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.1 $ 0.5 $ (0.4 ) General and administrative 21.6 14.6 7.0 Research and development 0.2 (0.2 ) Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 124.9 19 % $ 112.8 18 % $ 12.1 General and administrative 71.1 11 % 65.7 10 % 5.4 Research and development 33.7 5 % 38.1 6 % (4.4 ) Sales and Marketing. Increased headcount, benefit costs and promotional spending, including our InforMax acquisition in December 2002, accounted for $13.5 million of the $12.1 million increase. This increase was partially offset by $1.0 million from expense reductions resulting from the closure of our Alabama location in April 2002 and the sales of our BioSepra and Serva entities in July 2001 and June 2002, respectively. Lower deferred compensation accounted for the remaining $0.4 million reduction in expense during 2002. General and Administrative. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses is due to: $7.3 million from increased headcount, benefit costs, and related spending, including our InforMax acquisition; $2.4 million in costs associated with the retirement of our chief executive officer, and $1.1 million in costs to purchase the rights to change in control agreements from four key management members. These higher expenses were partially offset by $4.1 million in cost reductions from the closure of our operations in Alabama and the sales of our BioSepra and Serva entities, and lower deferred compensation expense of $1.3 million. Research and Development. The decrease in research and development expenses reflects unfilled research and development positions as we transitioned these positions from our Maryland facilities to California during 2001, which accounted for $2.7 million in lower costs, the closure of our operations in Alabama and the sales of our BioSepra and Serva entities, which accounted for another 33 $3.1 million in cost reductions. The lower costs were partially offset by higher spending on a genome project in 2002 of approximately $1.3 million. Goodwill Amortization. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. The adoption of these statements also resulted in the reclassification of the net book value assigned to the assembled workforce intangible at December 31, 2001, which totaled $33.4 million, to goodwill. Amortization expense for goodwill for 2001 totaled $175.7 million. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $64.3 million for 2002 and $90.5 million for 2001. The reduction in expense from 2001 to 2002 is due to; one intangible asset that became fully amortized in September 2001 which accounted for a $19.7 million reduction in 2002; the reclassification of the assembled workforce intangible to goodwill in 2002 which accounted for a $4.8 million reduction; the assignment of an indefinite life under SFAS No. 142 to the portion of the purchased tradenames and trademarks allocated to the GIBCO tradename, which totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2001, and accounted for an additional $1.0 million reduction in amortization expense as this intangible is no longer amortized beginning January 1, 2002. Business Integration Costs. Business integration costs for 2002, were $16.2 million and include $13.9 million from the integration of our Alabama operations with the rest of the company. The integration costs include $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Business integration costs for 2002 also include costs for restructuring and integrating the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen which are comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. Business integrations costs for 2001, totaled $11.3 million and are for the restructuring and integration of the operations of Life Technologies and Invitrogen. These costs are mainly comprised of $7.0 million in retention, severance and relocation costs as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California, $1.8 million in costs to exit distributor contracts, $1.6 million in business reorganization consulting fees and $0.7 million in product catalogue obsolescence. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $7.1 million from $20.3 million for 2001, to $27.4 million for 2002. The increase during 2002 was mainly attributable to larger balances of cash and investments during 2002, partially offset by lower rates of interest earned on investments during 2002. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $12.8 million from $11.3 million for 2001, to $24.1 million for 2002. The increase in 2002 was due mainly to interest on the 2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 that were issued in December 2001. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 2002 and 2001, is comprised of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2002 2001 Net periodic pension income(1) $ 1.3 $ 2.5 Loss on the sale of our Serva subsidiary (0.5 ) Loss on the sale of our Indian subsidiary (0.3 ) Gain on sale of a product line 1.2 Gain on sale of a European facility 1.0 Gain on sale of our BioSepra subsidiary 0.4 Net foreign currency exchange losses (1.1 ) (1.5 ) Other 0.7 Total other income (expense), net $ (0.6 ) $ 4.3 (1) The net periodic pension income is from an defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income since the plan provides benefits to participants who are not employees of Invitrogen. 34 Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 31.2% for 2002 and a negative 6.8% in 2001. The change from 2001 was primarily attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Such amortization was non deductible for tax purposes. For 2001, a $9.3 million tax provision was provided on a pre tax loss of $137.3 million. Included in pre tax income are certain business integration costs and amortization expense of certain purchased intangibles that provide financial reporting tax benefits at rates higher than our effective tax rate for all other pre tax income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash of $168.1 million during 2003 primarily from our net income of $60.1 million plus net non cash charges of $107.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net $0.2 million of cash during the period, driven primarily by a decrease in inventories, which excludes the initial purchase of inventories from business combinations, and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities for compensation related accruals, interest and legal accruals. These sources of cash were reduced by $13.6 million that was paid to settle a claim with the Veterans Administration that was acquired in connection with our acquisition of Life Technologies in 2000. As a result of the examination by the IRS concluded in 2003, Invitrogen adjusted deferred tax liabilities from $6.0 million to $27.7 million related to the undistributed earnings on a group of foreign subsidiaries that arose prior to their acquisition by Invitrogen. Such pre acquisition earnings are not considered to be permanently invested in those operations. The effect of the adjustment was to increase goodwill by $21.7 million. This deferred tax liability is included in long term deferred income tax liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003, and will be payable at the time we choose to distribute these earnings. As a result of working capital improvement programs currently being developed we expect to utilize more efficiently our working capital in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal, and, on an interim basis during the year, may require short term working capital needs. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2003, was $508.4 million, and reflects a net $422.8 million paid for our business acquisitions, a net $55.5 million invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months and payments for capital expenditures and intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties), which totaled $32.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. These uses were offset by $2.7 million in cash received from the sale of one of our Huntsville facilities. For 2004, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate $35 million. On August 20, 2003, we completed our acquisition of the common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., for cash of $307.3 million. We also paid $2.4 million in closing costs, $3.3 million in severance costs and acquired cash totaling $7.3 million. On March 28, 2003, we completed our acquisition of products and technology rights of PanVera for $94.9 million in cash and the assumption of $6.3 million in debt, which we subsequently paid off in May 2003. As part of the transaction, we have also acquired PanVeras research and development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Other cash costs in connection with this transaction include $1.3 million paid to buy out operating leases to acquire equipment and $1.5 million in closing costs. In 2003, we entered into three small business combinations, one of which included the acquisition of the remaining 60% ownership in a consolidated subsidiary. The purchases totaled $9.8 million in addition to the return of the selling partners capital account for the 60% interest described above. Beginning in July 2003 we no longer report a minority interest adjustment in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Pursuant to the purchase agreement for one of these acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on certain operating results of the acquired company. Over the next four years, payments aggregating a maximum of $4.0 million and certain other payments based upon percentages of future gross sales of the acquired company could be required. We will account for any such contingent payments as an addition to the purchase price With the acquisition of the InforMax business in December 2002, we acquired certain leased properties which we are no longer using in our operations. We have included the full value of these lease obligations, net of sublease income, discounted at 8%, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2003, $1.1 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $5.5 million is included in long term obligations, deferred credits and reserves. Our current annual obligation under these leases, before sublease income, is approximately $2.0 million. We are continuing our efforts to sublease these properties or otherwise reduce these lease obligations. During 2003 we paid $3.1 million to terminate some of these lease obligations. 35 We are offering for sale certain facilities in Huntsville, Alabama which became idle or excess as we have consolidated our operations. At December 31, 2003, we have $1.5 million recorded as assets held for sale for these facilities, which we expect to sell within the next twelve months and have included this amount in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On February 6, 2004, we acquired all of the common stock and outstanding debt of BioReliance Corporation for an estimated total cash purchase price of $433 million, plus the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $70 million. The purchase price was paid from existing cash and investments. Effective December 31, 2003, based upon a reevaluation of funding for our acquisition strategies, we changed our intent from holding our marketable securities to maturity, to holding our securities as available for sale. The change resulted in a reclassification of $579.3 million from securities classified as held to maturity to securities held available for sale and the recognition of net unrealized gains of $1.2 million in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $364.2 million for 2003, and includes $340.7 million in net proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes in August 2003 and $35.3 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. This net cash provided was offset by $5.4 million used to pay off remaining accruals as trades settled on our common stock shares that were repurchased at the end of 2002, $4.1 million used to return a selling partners capital account and $2.1 million used to pay off our bonds payable to the State Industrial Development Authority of Alabama. On February 19, 2004, we issued $450 million principal amount of 1% Convertible Senior Notes, or 1% Notes, due 2024, to certain qualified institutional buyers. In March 2004, we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this debt to redeem our 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 5% Notes, due 2007, in the aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million at a premium of 102.357%, plus accrued interest. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including potential redemption or repayment of other outstanding debt. After expenses, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $440.7 million. Interest on the 1% Notes is payable semi annually on February 15th and August 15th. In addition to the coupon interest of 1%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The 1% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 4.4 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $102.03 per share. The 1% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after February 15, 2012, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the 1% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the 1% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on February 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022. Invitrogen has also granted an option to the initial purchasers of the notes to purchase by March 3, 2004, up to an additional $67.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The anticipated redemption in March 2004, of our $172.5 million principal amount of 5% Notes, due 2007, outstanding at December 31, 2003, at a premium of 102.357% is expected to result in a charge to other income and expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations of $6.7 million for the call premium and the write of unamortized deferred debt costs. Interest on the 5% Notes is currently payable semi annually on March 1st and September 1st. The 5% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 2.0 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder at any time at a price of $85.20 per share. The 5% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and, through February 28, 2005, at an initial premium of 102.357% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The premium declines annually each March 1st thereafter to 100% of the principal amount of the notes at March 1, 2007. In August 2003, we issued $350 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes, or 2% Notes, due August 1, 2023, to certain qualified institutional buyers. The issuance of this debt was used to finance our acquisition of Molecular Probes in August 2003. After expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $340.9 million. Interest on the 2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 1st and August 1st. In addition to the coupon interest of 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning August 1, 2010, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.1 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $68.24 per share. The 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after August 1, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the 2% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the 2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2013, and August 1, 2018. 36 We have $500 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 2% Notes, due 2006, outstanding at December 31, 2003. Interest on the 2% Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of any holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the 2% Notes, the 2% Notes and the 5% Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over a three year period ending in 2005. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost, in cash and accruals, of $100.0 million during 2002, which has been reported as a reduction in stockholders equity as Treasury Stock. During 2003 no shares were repurchased. The timing and price of future repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. Funds for any future repurchases are expected to come primarily from cash generated from operations, or funds on hand. We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery and BioProduction platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of $588.7 million, short term investments of $403.4 million and long term investments of $177.1 million. Our working capital totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2003, and includes restricted cash and investments of $6.6 million. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, corporate notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2003, foreign subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $5.9 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2003. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2003, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 Years Long term debt(1) $ 1,024,362 $ 862 $ 500,000 $ 173,500 $ 350,000 Capital lease obligations 24,006 1,606 2,883 2,838 16,679 Operating lease obligations 57,659 10,870 16,978 10,621 19,190 Licensing and purchase obligations 32,014 14,804 12,751 3,750 709 Deferred compensation 2,141 415 768 227 731 Total $ 1,140,182 $ 28,557 $ 533,380 $ 190,936 $ 387,309 (1) In February 2004 we issued $450 million principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, due 2024. In March 2004, we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this debt to redeem our Notes due 2007 in the aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million at a premium of 102.357%, plus accrued interest. 37 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $11.7 million at December 31, 2003. We recognize royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and or remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $10.7 million, $5.7 million and $5.2 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the financial condition of that customer or in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $121.2 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.1 million at December 31, 2003. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Gross inventories were stated at $153.4 million at December 31, 2003, and include $17.6 million in purchase accounting adjustments to write up acquired inventory to fair value. Reserves for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory were $26.7 million at December 31, 2003. Valuation of goodwill. We are required to perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; 38 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. We completed our recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2003, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Our evaluation included management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review from July 2003. Key assumptions from this strategic review included revenue growth, with higher net income growth. This growth was based on increased sales of new products as we expect to increase our investment in research and development, the full year effect and growth from business acquisitions already consummated, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Additional value creators assumed included increased efficiencies in working capital as well as increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 12%. Operating mechanisms to ensure that these growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized were also proposed as part of the internal strategic review and considered in our evaluation. Our market capitalization at October 1, 2003, was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis. We cannot assure you that when we complete our future annual or other periodic reviews for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $983.4 million at December 31, 2003. Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2003, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $457.2 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $186.2 million. 39 Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $0.8 million at December 31, 2003, the majority of which we expect to pay during the first three months of 2004. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter, which was acquired in 2000. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $10.3 million at December 31, 2003. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. See discussion under Recent Accounting Pronouncements below. Income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we 40 do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our assets to our BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments. We also do not report product line information as it would be impracticable to do so. Pro forma Stock Based Compensation. We provide pro forma net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share amounts in accordance with the disclosure only provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The stock based compensation expense used in these pro forma amounts is based on the fair value of the option at the grant date which uses the present value pricing method described in SFAS No. 123. This method requires us to use several assumptions to estimate the fair value, including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected life. Should any of these assumptions change or differ from the actual life or actual stock price volatility, our pro forma results could differ substantially. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88 and 106, and a revision of SFAS No. 132. The statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after December 15, 2003. This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS No. 87, 88 and 106. The new rules require additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The required information has been provided separately for Invitrogens pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans (see note 10). The adoption of this Statement did not have an impact on Invitrogens consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 1 (FSP 106 1), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The guidance is effective for initial interim or annual fiscal periods ending after December 7, 2003. FSP 106 1 permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans (plan sponsors) that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Without FSP 106 1, plan sponsors would be required under SFAS No. 106 to account for the effects of the Act in the fiscal period that includes December 8, 2003, the date the President signed the Act into law. Invitrogen has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. As a result of this, measurement of the accumulated plan benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in note 10 does not reflect the effects of the Act on Invitrogens postretirement benefit plan. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance, when issued, could require Invitrogen to change previously reported information on the disclosure of its Dexter Postretirement Health and Benefit Program in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $777.7 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2002 to our non U.S. revenues for 2003 would result in $40.6 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. To assist investors with the comparisons of our underlying business between currently reported periods, we have provided our revenue and growth rate results on a foreign currency comparable basis. 41 MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these receivables and payables are also included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $0.1 million, ($1.1) million and ($1.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2003, we had $43.8 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which all settled on various dates through January 2004, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. In January 2004 we expanded our foreign currency hedging program to include hedging of forecasted foreign currency cash flows and executed forward contracts having a gross U.S. dollar value at the time of execution of $198.5 million. The contracts mature on various dates through 2004. The contracts increase or decrease in value prior to their maturity will be accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent any portion of the forward contracts is determined to not be an effective hedge, the increase or decrease in value prior to the maturity will be recorded in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2003, we had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $720.2 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2003, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would, however, decrease or increase, respectively, the remaining $446.9 million of our investments by approximately $5.1 million. While changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment.
