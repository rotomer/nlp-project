Contingently convertible debt instruments are financial instruments that add a contingent feature to a convertible debt instrument. The conversion feature is triggered when one or more specified contingencies occur and at least one of these contingencies is based on market price. Invitrogen has two series of contingently convertible debt instruments, which contained certain contingent conversion features, including certain market value triggers; therefore, EITF 04 8 has been applied to Invitrogens diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a leading supplier of kits, reagents, sera and cell media, and informatics software for life sciences research, drug discovery, and the production of biopharmaceuticals with sales over $1.0 billion in 2004. We offer a full range of products that enable researchers to understand the molecular basis of life and potential mechanisms of disease, as well as identify attractive targets for drug development. Our products are also used to support the clinical development and commercial production of biopharmaceuticals. We focus our business on two principal segments: BioDiscovery. Our BioDiscovery product segment includes our functional genomics, cell biology and drug discovery product lines. Functional genomics encompasses products from the initial cloning and manipulation of DNA, to examining RNA levels and regulating gene expression in cells, to capturing, separating and analyzing proteins. These include research tools used in reagent and kit form that simplify and improve gene acquisition, gene cloning, gene expression, and gene analysis techniques. This segment includes a full range of enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents. These biologics are manufactured to the highest research standards and are matched in a gene specific, validated manner (gene, orf, rnai, protein, antibodies, etc.) to ensure researchers the highest purity and scientific relevance for their experimentation. We also offer software through this segment that enables more efficient and accelerated analysis and interpretation of genomic, proteomic and other biomolecular data for application in pharmaceutical, therapeutic and diagnostic development. The recent acquisition of Zymed and proposed acquisition of Dynal have introduced and will continue to enable us to offer new technology and products, such as antibodies and proteins (Zymed) and magnetic beads used for biological separation (Dynal), which is the first step in almost every biologic investigative or diagnostic process. BioProduction. Our BioProduction product segment includes all of our cell culture products and biological testing services business. Products include sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce pharmaceuticals and other materials made through cultured cells. BioProduction services include testing to ensure that biologics are free of disease causing agents or do not cause adverse effects; characterization of products chemical structures; development of formulations for long term stability; and validation of purification processes under regulatory guidelines. We also manufacture biologics on behalf of clients both for use in clinical trials and for the worldwide commercial market. The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions, and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, energy, agricultural and chemical companies. Life sciences researchers use our reagents and informatics to perform a broad range of experiments in the laboratory. The biopharmaceutical production market consists of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that use sera and media for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of biopharmaceuticals. The selection of sera and media generally occurs early in the clinical process and continues through commercialization. Other industries consume sera and media for the commercial production of genetically engineered products including food processing and agricultural industries. Our Strategy Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery and commercial bioproduction. 21 Table of Contents Our strategies to achieve this objective include: New Product Innovation and Development Developing innovative new products. We place a great emphasis on internally developing new technologies for the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical production markets. A significant portion of our growth and current revenue base has been created by the application of technology to accelerate the drug discovery process of our customers. We expect to increase research and development spending as a percentage of sales over the next several quarters, and to focus new product development on three critical technology areas: Protein production, purification and characterization; Biochemical and cell based assays; and Labeling and detection, particularly in proteomics. In licensing technologies. We actively and selectively in license new technologies, which we modify to create high value kits, many of which address bottlenecks in the research or drug discovery laboratories. We have a dedicated group of individuals that is focused on in licensing technologies from academic and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Acquisitions. We actively and selectively seek to acquire and integrate companies with complementary products and technologies, trusted brand names, strong market positions, and strong intellectual property positions. We have acquired numerous companies since we became a public company in 1999. Our most significant acquisitions to date include Life Technologies, BioReliance, Molecular Probes, PanVera, and NOVEX. Recent significant acquisitions include: Our February 6, 2004, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of BioReliance Corporation. BioReliance is a leading contract service organization providing testing, development and manufacturing services for biologic based drugs to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The results of operations of BioReliance have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioProduction segment from the date of acquisition. Our August 20, 2003, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., a privately held corporation based in Eugene, Oregon. Molecular Probes is a provider of fluorescence based technologies for use in labeling molecules for biological research and drug discovery. The results of operations of Molecular Probes have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Our March 28, 2003, acquisition of products and technology rights from PanVera LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Based in Madison, Wisconsin, our PanVera business provides products and services that are designed to accelerate the discovery of new medicines by the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Through this transaction, we acquired PanVeras biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and its commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents, probes and proteins. In addition, we also acquired PanVeras research, development and manufacturing facility in Madison. The results of operations of PanVera have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. 22 Table of Contents Leverage of Existing Sales and Distribution Infrastructure Multi national sales footprint. We have developed a sales and distribution network with sales in approximately 70 countries throughout the world. Our sales force is highly trained, with many of our sales people possessing degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry or related fields. We believe our sales force has a proven track record for selling and distributing our products, and we expect to leverage this capacity to increase sales of our existing, newly developed and acquired products. We sell most of our products through our own sales force, and the remaining products are sold through agents or distributors. We currently market our products directly in over 24 countries throughout the world and sell through distributors or agents in approximately 45 additional countries. These independent distributors may also market research products for other companies, including some products that are competitive with our offerings. High customer satisfaction. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical support staffs work well together to provide our customers exceptional service for our products, and we have been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys. We use this strength to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. Rapid product delivery. We have the ability to ship typical orders on a same day or next day basis. We use this ability to provide convenient service to our customers to generate additional sales. Our BioDiscovery and BioProduction products are used for research purposes, and their use by our customers generally is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our BioProduction products and manufacturing sites, including some sites of our BioReliance subsidiary, are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities located in Carlsbad, California; Eugene, Oregon; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Auckland, New Zealand; and Paisley, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in Japan, Brazil, and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We conduct research activities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Except for our oligonucleotide (custom primers), genomic services, biologics testing, specialized manufacturing, and cell culture production businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys 23 Table of Contents functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors that may Affect Future Results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase % Increase (dollars in millions) 2004 2003 BioDiscovery revenues $ 591.4 $ 500.5 $ 90.9 18 % BioProduction revenues 432.5 277.2 155.3 56 % Total revenues $ 1,023.9 $ 777.7 $ 246.2 32 % BioDiscovery gross margin 70 % 68 % BioProduction gross margin 49 % 52 % Total gross margin 59 % 60 % When comparing 2004 revenues with 2003, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $34.8 million of the $246.2 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue growth rate by 5%. The increase in revenues also includes $173.5 million, or 22%, from our recent acquisitions: BioReliance, which we acquired in February 2004; Molecular Probes, which we acquired in August 2003; and the PanVera business, which we acquired at the end of March 2003. Higher volume and royalty revenue accounted for an additional $31.3 million or 4% increase, while higher average selling prices contributed another $6.6 million or 1%. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the euro, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $22.2 million when comparing 2004 with 2003 and accounted for 4% of the 18% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $59.9 million, or 12%, from our recent acquisitions, $11.9 million or 2% from higher volume growth and $3.2 million or 1% from higher royalty revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices of $6.3 million or 1.0%. We currently expect our BioDiscovery growth rate to be approximately 4% to 5% for 2005. BioProduction Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioProduction revenues by $12.6 million when comparing 2004 with 2003 and accounted for 4% of the 56% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $113.6 million, or 41%, primarily from our 24 Table of Contents recent acquisition of BioReliance. The remainder of the increase reflects volume growth of $16.1 million or 6%, as well as average selling price increases, particularly for sera products, which accounted for $12.9 million or 5%. We currently expect our BioProduction growth rate to be approximately 11% to 12% for 2005. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. We also believe that it is unlikely for price increases for sera products to continue, and, therefore, do not anticipate that price increases will contribute to our growth rates or gross margin as much as they have in the past three years. Gross Margin. The decrease in gross margin during 2004 when compared to 2003 reflects costs of $17.6 million, or 1% of revenues, associated with the sale during 2004 of products acquired with Molecular Probes that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. In addition, higher costs for sera products accounted for a 1% decrease in gross margin and the acquisition of BioReliance, a lower gross margin business, accounted for a 1% decrease. These decreases in gross margin are offset by a 1% increase in gross margin resulting from lower variable costs associated with productivity improvements and favorable changes in foreign currency rates, which improved margins by 1%. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements, and foreign currency rates. BioDiscovery Segment Gross Margin. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2004 when compared to 2003 is due to the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses which accounted for improved margins of 1%, a 1% increase in gross margin resulting from lower variable costs associated with productivity improvements and favorable changes in foreign currency rates which improved margins by 1%. These increases are partially offset by a 1% decrease in gross margin resulting from unfavorable changes in average selling prices. BioProduction Segment Gross Margin. The decrease in BioProduction gross margin during 2004 when compared to 2003 reflects the lower gross margin BioReliance service business, which reduced margins by 2%, and higher unit costs net of higher average selling prices for sera products, which reduced margins by 3%. These decreases are partially offset by a 2% increase in gross margin resulting from lower variable costs associated with productivity improvements. 25 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense(1) As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 126.3 21 % $ 116.1 23 % $ 10.2 General and administrative 70.7 12 % 65.6 13 % 5.1 Research and development 62.5 11 % 46.6 9 % 15.9 BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 54.2 13 % $ 38.3 14 % $ 15.9 General and administrative 39.9 9 % 22.9 8 % 17.0 Research and development 9.7 2 % 7.7 3 % 2.0 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 General and administrative 0.1 0.2 (0.1 ) Research and development 0.9 0.3 0.6 Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 180.7 18 % $ 154.5 20 % $ 26.2 General and administrative 110.7 11 % 88.7 11 % 22.0 Research and development 73.1 7 % 54.6 7 % 18.5 (1) 2004 presentation of 2003 general and administrative expenses by segment reflects reclassifications of general and administrative costs from the Corporate and Unallocated segment to the BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments to conform to our corporate expense allocation methodology applied in 2004. Sales and Marketing. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2004 as compared to 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera, which accounted for $15.6 million of the increase, changes in foreign currency rates that increased expense by $5.5 million, an increase in commissions of $2.8 million, increased headcount, and relocation and recruiting fees, which accounted for $4.8 million of the increase and $0.9 million for the impairment of an asset determined by management to be obsolete. These increases were partially offset by $2.3 million in lower advertising fees. Sales and marketing expenses for 2003 also include accelerated depreciation expense of $1.1 million for a portion of our e commerce software that was rendered obsolete by a new system in 2004. We expect to see continued productivity gains in our sales and marketing expenditures as we use product specialists to support our existing customer account managers allowing us to maintain the effectiveness of our direct selling organization while offering an ever increasing portfolio of products. General and Administrative. The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2004 as compared to 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera, which accounted for $20.3 million of the increase, costs associated with increased headcount, relocation and recruiting of $5.0 million, changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $1.8 million, and $2.0 million of costs related to the implementation of Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 internal control evaluations. These increases were partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease resulting primarily from lower legal/professional and other fees. 26 Table of Contents We continue to pursue programs and initiatives to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Research and Development. The increase in research and development expenses during 2004 as compared to 2003 reflects research and development costs associated with acquired businesses, primarily BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera, which in total accounted for $14.3 million of the increase, changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $0.5 million, and $5.2 million of increased costs associated with increased headcount, and related relocation and recruiting costs. Research and development expenses for 2003 also include accelerated amortization of purchased technology of $1.5 million. We expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues will continue to increase as we expand our capabilities to accelerate innovation and ramp up research and development of recently acquired businesses. Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for intangible assets purchased in our business acquisitions was $106.8 million for 2004 and $79.4 million for 2003. The increase in 2004 is due primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera acquisitions. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. Purchased in process research and development costs of $0.7 million for 2004 resulted from a 2004 acquisition that was not material to the overall consolidated financial statements and represents acquired current research and development projects in process. Purchased in process research and development costs of $1.4 million for 2003 resulted from the Molecular Probes acquisition and represents acquired research and development projects. Business Integration Costs. Business integration costs for 2003 were $1.3 million and represent an impairment loss of $0.9 million on assets held for sale in Huntsville, Alabama, related to the closure of our facilities located there, in addition to $0.4 million in costs incurred for the integration of InforMax, acquired in December 2002. These costs were for the relocation of property, closure of facilities and retention of employees. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $1.3 million from $24.0 million for 2003 to $25.3 million for 2004. The increase in interest income is due mainly to interest rates generally trending higher in 2004. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances, which could be materially reduced by acquisitions and other financing activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.6 million from $28.6 million for 2003 to $32.2 million for 2004. Our issuance of $450 million in principal amount of 1 1/2% convertible senior notes in February 2004 and $350 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes in August 2003 accounted for $10.7 million of the increase for 2004, offset by the redemption in March 2004 of $172.5 million of our 5 1/2% convertible notes, which reduced interest expense by $8.2 million. The remainder of the increase in 2004 was due mainly to interest expense of $1.1 million on our capital lease and debt obligations acquired in the BioReliance acquisition and former capital lease obligations in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt. A loss of $6.8 million was recognized during 2004 on the early retirement of our $172.5 million in principal amount of 5 1/2% convertible notes and includes $4.1 million for the call premium and $2.7 million for the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 27 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2004 and 2003, is comprised of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 Net periodic pension income (expense)(1) $ 0.4 $ (0.5 ) Gain (loss) on asset disposals (0.8 ) Gain (loss) on the sale of our Serva subsidiary(2) 0.9 Gain on sale of an investment 0.3 Impairment loss on vacant land (0.6 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) (0.4 ) 0.1 Total other income (expense), net $ (0.8 ) $ 0.2 (1) The net periodic pension income and expense is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who were not continuing employees of Invitrogen following the merger. (2) The gain was recognized in June 2003 on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, which was sold in 2002, resulting from the collection of cash on a note receivable from the sale that was fully reserved for at the time of the sale. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 26.8% for 2004 compared with 28.6% for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a reduction of income tax on foreign income that resulted from restructuring the ownership of certain foreign businesses to achieve better alignment with our operational and management structure, offset in part by an increase in the proportion of income earned in tax jurisdictions having higher tax rates. In October 2004, the President signed the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004, which retroactively reinstated the research credit for qualifying activities arising after June 30, 2004. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, the effect of the change in tax law is recognized in the period that the new legislation was enacted, which is the fourth quarter of 2004. The additional research credit reduced income tax expense $0.9 million or 0.7%. In October 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which, among other things, prospectively phases out the extraterritorial income deduction, provides for certain domestic manufacturing tax relief, reforms the foreign tax credit regime, and allows for tax favored repatriation of international earnings. Many of the new tax provisions have an effective date beginning in 2005. The impact of this law change to our 2004 income tax expense is not significant. 28 Table of Contents Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Revenues For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase % Increase (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 BioDiscovery revenues $ 500.5 $ 428.9 $ 71.6 17% BioProduction revenues 277.2 219.7 57.5 26% Total revenues $ 777.7 $ 648.6 $ 129.1 20% BioDiscovery gross margin 68% 62% BioProduction gross margin 52% 51% Total gross margin 60% 58% When comparing 2003 revenues with 2002, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $40.6 million of the $129.1 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue growth rate by 6%. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 7%, from our recent acquisitions: InforMax, which we acquired in December 2002; the PanVera business which we acquired at the end of March 2003; and Molecular Probes which we acquired in August 2003. Higher volume accounted for an additional 3% increase, while higher prices contributed another 4%. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $24.1 million when comparing 2003 with 2002 and accounted for 6% of the 17% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 11%, from our recent acquisitions. BioProduction Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioProduction revenues by $16.5 million when comparing the year ended December 30, 2003, with 2002 and accounted for 8% of the 26% increase in revenues. The remainder of the increase reflects volume growth of 9% driven by our large scale production applications, as well as price increases, particularly for sera products, which accounted for 9%. Gross Margin. The increase in gross margin during 2003 when compared to 2002 reflects the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses during 2003, which accounted for improved margins of 2%, favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which accounted for improved margins of 1%, and higher prices which accounted for improved margins 1%. These margin improvements were offset by costs of $15.1 million, or 2%, associated with the sale during 2003 of products acquired in our business combinations that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. BioDiscovery Segment Gross Margin. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2003 is due to favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which improved margins by 3%, the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses which accounted for improved margins of 2% and favorable changes in foreign currency rates which improved margins by 1%. BioProduction Segment Gross Margin. Higher average selling prices increasing at a faster rate than costs in both our sera and non sera product lines accounted for a 3% improvement in BioProduction gross margin during 2003. Favorable changes in foreign currency rates improved margins by 1% and unfavorable changes in mix reduced gross margins by 2%. 29 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense(1) As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense(1) As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 116.1 23 % $ 94.9 22 % $ 21.2 General and administrative 65.6 13 % 50.6 12 % 15.0 Research and development 46.6 9 % 27.8 6 % 18.8 BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 38.3 14 % $ 29.9 14 % $ 8.4 General and administrative 22.9 8 % 20.4 9 % 2.5 Research and development 7.7 3 % 5.9 3 % 1.8 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ General and administrative 0.2 0.1 0.1 Research and development 0.3 0.3 Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 154.5 20 % $ 124.9 19 % $ 29.6 General and administrative 88.7 11 % 71.1 11 % 17.6 Research and development 54.6 7 % 33.7 5 % 20.9 (1) 2004 presentation of 2003 and 2002 general and administrative expenses by segment reflects reclassifications of general and administrative costs from the Corporate and Unallocated segment to the BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments to conform to our corporate expense allocation methodology applied in 2004. Sales and Marketing. The absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2003 is due to: expenses of our acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera, and Molecular Probes, which accounted for $10.6 million of the increase; increased headcount, compensation and selling activities which accounted for $12.8 million of the increase, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expense by $5.2 million. Sales and marketing expenses for 2003 also include accelerated depreciation expense of $1.1 million for a portion of our e commerce software that will be rendered obsolete by a new system in 2004. General and Administrative. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses during 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase; higher legal costs of $4.4 million; costs associated with the transition in the chief executive officer position which accounted for $1.5 million; increased headcount and related spending and business insurance of $5.3 million, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $2.2 million. These costs are partially offset by cost reductions during 2003 of $2.8 million from the closure of our operations in Alabama in April 2002 and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. Research and Development. The increase in research and development expenses during 2003 reflects: software development costs for the InforMax business, research and development costs associated with Molecular Probes acquisition and the PanVera business acquired which in total accounted for $13.0 million of the increase; increased headcount and related spending as we continued to fill research and development positions in Carlsbad which accounted for $6.1 million of the increase and deferred compensation expense of $0.3 million from stock options assumed in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Research and development 30 Table of Contents expenses for 2003 also include accelerated amortization of purchased technology of $1.5 million for which management has determined that there is limited opportunity to develop commercial applications. Additional catch up depreciation expense of $0.9 million was recognized in 2003 for a building that was removed from service in April 2002 and held for sale until November 2003 when our strategy changed to reactivate the facility for research and development activities. Higher expense for grants accounted for another $0.5 million increase for 2003. These increases were partially offset by the closure of our Alabama facility and the sale of our Serva entity that reduced research and development costs by $1.5 million in 2003. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other intangible assets purchased in our business acquisitions was $79.4 million for 2003, and $64.3 million for 2002. The increase in 2003 is due primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes acquisitions. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. Purchased in process research and development costs of $1.4 million for 2003 resulted from the Molecular Probes acquisition and represent acquired current research and development projects in process. Business Integration Costs. Merger related business integration costs for 2003 were $1.3 million and represent an additional impairment loss of $0.9 million on assets held for sale in Huntsville, Alabama, related to the closure of our facilities located there in addition to $0.4 million in costs incurred for the integration of InforMax, acquired in December 2002. These costs were for the relocation of property, closure of facilities and retention of employees. Business integration costs for 2002 were $16.2 million and include $13.9 million from the integration of our Alabama operations with the rest of the company. The integration costs include $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Business integration costs for 2002 also include costs for restructuring and integrating the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen which are comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $3.4 million from $27.4 million for 2002, to $24.0 million for 2003. The reduction in interest income is due mainly to lower interest rates. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.5 million from $24.1 million for 2002 to $28.6 million for 2003. Our issuance of $350 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes in August 2003 increased interest expense by $3.1 million for 2003. The remainder of the increase in 2003 was due mainly to $0.7 million of imputed interest on unfavorable lease obligations acquired in the InforMax acquisition and interest expense of $0.4 million on our capital lease obligation acquired in the Molecular Probes acquisition. 31 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2003 and 2002, is comprised of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Net periodic pension income (expense)(1) $ (0.5 ) $ 1.3 Gain (loss) on the sale of our Serva subsidiary(2) 0.9 (0.5 ) Gain on sale of an investment 0.3 Impairment loss on vacant land (0.6 ) Loss on the sale of our Indian subsidiary (0.3 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 0.1 (1.1 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 0.2 $ (0.6 ) (1) The net periodic pension income and expense is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who were not continuing employees of Invitrogen following the merger. (2) The gain was recognized in June 2003 on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, which was sold in 2002, resulting from the collection of cash on a note receivable from the sale that was fully reserved for at the time of the sale. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 28.6% for 2003 compared with 31.2% for 2002. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to additional tax credits for research expenditures incurred in 2003 and an increase in the proportion of income earned in tax jurisdictions having lower tax rates. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash of $252.7 million during 2004 primarily from our net income of $88.8 million plus net non cash charges of $147.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net $16.7 million of cash during the period, driven primarily by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $17.8 million, a decrease in inventories of $11.3 million, and an increase of income taxes payable of $11.5 million offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $19.8 million. The growth of accounts receivable resulted from an increase in revenues as well as from a higher proportion of 2004 fourth quarter sales recognized at the end of the quarter compared with a lower proportion of 2003 fourth quarter sales recognized at the end of the quarter. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulted from higher compensation related accruals, interest and legal accruals, as well as an increase in cash flow hedging activities. The decrease in inventories reflects the amortization of costs of $17.6 million, associated with the sale during 2004 of products acquired in our business combinations that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. As a result of working capital improvement programs we expect to utilize more efficiently our working capital in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal, and, on an interim basis during the year, may require short term working capital needs. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2004, was $689.5 million, and reflects a net $520.8 million paid for our business acquisitions, a net $121.8 million invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months and payments for capital expenditures and intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties), which totaled $39.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. These uses were partially offset by $1.3 million in cash received from the sale of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility. For 2005, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate $55 million. 32 Table of Contents In 2005, we completed two acquisitions that were not material to our overall consolidated financial statements. The aggregate cash purchase price of these acquisitions is expected to be approximately $68 million. The results of operations will be included in our future consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. In addition, on February 8, 2005, Invitrogen entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding securities of Dynal Biotechnologies Holding ASA for approximately NOK 2.5 Billion (approximately $390 million). The transaction is subject to the completion of certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval in Germany, and is expected to close during March 2005. In 2004, we completed three acquisitions that were not material to the overall consolidated financial statements. The total aggregate cash purchase price was $58.3 million and cash of $3.3 million was acquired. The results of operations were included from the respective dates of acquisition. In February 2004, we acquired all of the common stock of BioReliance Corporation for a total cash purchase price of $433.3 million, plus the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $70.4 million and transaction costs of $3.3 million. The purchase price was paid from existing cash and investments. In February 2004, we paid down $49.6 million of the acquired debt. In August 2003, we completed our acquisition of the common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., for cash of $307.4 million. We also paid $2.4 million in closing costs, $3.3 million in severance costs and acquired cash totaling $7.3 million. In March 2003, we completed our acquisition of products and technology rights of PanVera for $94.9 million in cash and the assumption of $6.3 million in debt, which we subsequently paid off in May 2003. As part of the transaction, we have also acquired PanVeras research and development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Other cash costs in connection with this transaction include $1.3 million paid to buy out operating leases to acquire equipment and $1.8 million in closing costs. In 2003, we entered into three acquisitions that were not material to the overall consolidated financial statements, one of which included the acquisition of the remaining 60% ownership in a consolidated subsidiary. The purchases totaled $9.9 million in addition to the return of the selling partners capital account for the 60% interest described above. Beginning in July 2003 we no longer report a minority interest adjustment in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Pursuant to the purchase agreements for certain 2004 and 2003 acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on certain operating results of the acquired companies. Payments aggregating a maximum of $118.5 and certain other payments based upon percentages of future gross sales of the acquired companies could be required through 2008. We will account for any such contingent payments as an addition to the respective purchase price. Effective December 31, 2003, based upon a reevaluation of funding for our acquisition strategies, we changed our intent from holding our marketable securities to maturity, to holding our securities as available for sale. The change resulted in a reclassification of $579.3 million from securities classified as held to maturity to securities held available for sale and the recognition of net unrealized gains of $1.2 million in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $232.9 million for 2004, and includes $438.9 million in net proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes in February 2004 and $61.3 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. This net cash in flow was offset by $81.3 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and $186.0 million used to retire debt including $176.6 million used in March 2004 to retire our 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 5 1/2% Notes, due 2007, and pay the call premium as well as $5.6 million in cash was paid towards the purchase of the Molecular Probes campus in Eugene, Oregon. 33 Table of Contents On February 19, 2004, we issued $450.0 million principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 1 1/2% Notes) due 2024, to certain qualified institutional buyers. Interest on the Old 1 1/2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 15th and August 15th. In addition to the coupon interest of 1 1/2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 1 1/2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 4.4 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $102.03 per share. The Old 1 1/2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after February 15, 2012, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 1 1/2% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 1 1/2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on February 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022. We have $350.0 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 2% Notes) due August 1, 2023. Interest on the Old 2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 1st and August 1st. In addition to the coupon interest of 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning August 1, 2010, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.1 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $68.24 per share. The Old 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after August 1, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 2% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2013, and August 1, 2018. In December 2004, we offered up to $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the New 2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 83% of the Old 2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 2% Notes. Additionally, Invitrogen offered up to $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the New 1 1/2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 1 1/2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 91% of the Old 1 1/2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 1 1/2% Notes. The New 2% Notes and New 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the New Notes) carry the same rights and attributes as the Old 2% Notes and Old 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the Old Notes) except for the following; the terms of the New Notes required Invitrogen to settle the par value of such notes in cash and deliver shares only for the differential between the stock price on the date of conversion and the base conversion price (initially approximately $68.24 for New 2% Notes and $102.03 for the New 1 1/2% Notes). We have $500.0 million principal amount of 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 2 1/4% Notes, due 2006, outstanding at December 31, 2004. Interest on the 2 1/4% Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 2 1/4% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of any holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 2 1/4% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the Old Notes, New Notes, and the 2 1/4% Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over a three year period ending in 2005. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $100.0 million during 2002. During 2004, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $81.3 million. All repurchases have been reported as a reduction in stockholders equity as treasury stock. The timing and price of any repurchase will depend on market conditions and other factors. Funds for any future repurchases are expected to come primarily from cash generated from operations, or funds on hand. 34 Table of Contents We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery and BioProduction platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $198.4 million, short term investments of $779.3 million and long term investments of $109.1 million. Our working capital totaled over $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2004, and includes restricted cash and investments of $5.7 million. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, corporate notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2004, foreign subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $8.9 million, of which $1.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2004. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months and the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period(1) (in thousands) Total Less than1 Year Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than5 Years Long term debt $ 1,325,281 $ 11,429 $ 512,976 $ 876 $ 800,000 Capital lease obligations 8,858 1,077 1,579 3,702 2,500 Operating lease obligations 94,502 15,675 23,904 19,040 35,883 Licensing and purchase obligations 34,883 13,517 19,321 1,780 265 Deferred compensation 1,678 282 568 255 573 Total $ 1,465,202 $ 41,980 $ 558,348 $ 25,653 $ 839,221 (1) Pursuant to certain acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on certain operating results of the acquired companies. Payments aggregating a maximum of $117.3 million and certain other payments based upon percentages of future gross sales and milestones of the acquired companies could be required through 2008. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $19.1 million at December 31, 2004. 35 Table of Contents We recognize royalty revenue (including upfront licensing fees) when the amounts are earned and determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis, as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and or remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $17.8 million, $10.7 million and $5.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We recognize revenue from commercial contracts, which are principally fixed price or fixed rate, using the proportional performance method, except for services that are generally completed within three days, which are accounted for using the completed contract method. Proportional performance is determined using expected output milestones. The proportional performance may be affected by future events, including delays caused by laboratory interruptions, client mandated changes and the unpredictability of biological processes. Accordingly, we undertake a review process to determine that recorded revenue represents the actual proportional performance in all material respects. Revenue recorded under proportional performance for projects in process is not intended to, and does not necessarily, represent the amount of revenue that we could recover from the client if any project failed or was cancelled. We undertake a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects. We recognize revenue from government contracts, which are principally cost plus fixed fee, in amounts equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro rata portion of the earned fee. We provide for losses when they become known. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the financial condition of that customer or in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $171.0 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.2 million at December 31, 2004. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Generally stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions 36 Table of Contents or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Gross inventories were stated at $149.5 million at December 31, 2004, and reserves for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory were $26.7 million at December 31, 2004. Valuation of goodwill. We are required to perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. We completed our most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2004, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Our evaluation included management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review from July 2004. Key assumptions from this strategic review included revenue growth, with higher net income growth. This growth was based on increased sales of new products as we expect to increase our investment in research and development, the full year effect and growth from business acquisitions already consummated, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Additional value creators assumed included increased efficiencies in working capital as well as increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 10%. Operating mechanisms to ensure that these growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized were also proposed as part of the internal strategic review and considered in our evaluation. Our market capitalization at October 1, 2004, was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis. We cannot assure you that when we complete our future annual or other periodic reviews for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2004. 37 Table of Contents Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets, which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2004, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $432.7 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $222.2 million. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $3.0 million at December 31, 2004, the majority of which we expect to pay during 2005. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter, which was acquired in 2000. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in 38 Table of Contents the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves, which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $10.0 million at December 31, 2004. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors, among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, reversing deferred tax liabilities, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our shared assets to the individual segments. Pro forma Stock Based Compensation. We provide pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts in accordance with the disclosure only provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The stock based compensation expense used in these pro forma amounts is based on the fair value of the option at the grant date which uses the present value pricing method described in SFAS No. 123. This method requires us to use several assumptions to estimate the fair value, including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected life. Should any of these assumptions change or differ from the actual life or actual stock price volatility, our pro forma results could differ substantially. 39 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, were over $1.0 billion using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2003 to our non U.S. revenues for 2004 would result in $34.8 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $(0.4) million, $0.1 million and ($1.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2004, we had $13.8 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which all settled on various dates through January 2005, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific 40 Table of Contents receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. At December 31, the notional principal and fair value of Invitrogens outstanding foreign currency derivatives to hedge the value of its foreign currency receivables and payables were as follows: 2004 2003 (in millions) Notional Principal Fair Value Notional Principal Fair Value Forward exchange contracts $ 13.8 $ (0.05 ) $ 44.01 $ (0.20 ) The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end, and does not represent the amount of Invitrogens exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. In addition to hedging the value of our foreign currency receivables and payables, our foreign currency hedging program includes hedging of forecasted foreign currency cash flows. At December 31, 2004, the value of our executed forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign currency cash flows totaled $164.9 million. The contracts mature on various dates through 2005. The contracts increase or decrease in value prior to their maturity will be accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent any portion of the forward contracts is determined to not be an effective hedge, the increase or decrease in value prior to the maturity will be recorded in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the cash flow hedge contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2004, a 10% decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies under contract would result in an approximate $16.5 million unrealized loss. Conversely, a 10% increase in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies under contract would result in a $16.5 million unrealized gain. Consistent with the nature of the economic hedge provided by these foreign exchange contracts, such unrealized gains or losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases, respectively, in the dollar value of the future foreign currency cash flows. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $198.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would, however, decrease or increase, respectively, the remaining $888.4 million of our investments by approximately $6.8 million. While changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment. 41 Table of Contents In February 2004, we acquired BioReliance Corporation, which did utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2004, there is one outstanding interest rate swap that was entered into by BioReliance. This instrument swapped floating rate LIBOR payments to fixed rate payments. The current notional amount of this swap is $4.1 million. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See discussion under Market Risk in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 42 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a leading supplier of kits, reagents, sera and cell media, and informatics software for life sciences research, drug discovery, and the production of biopharmaceuticals with sales over $1.0 billion in 2004. We offer a full range of products that enable researchers to understand the molecular basis of life and potential mechanisms of disease, as well as identify attractive targets for drug development. Our products are also used to support the clinical development and commercial production of biopharmaceuticals. We focus our business on two principal segments: BioDiscovery. Our BioDiscovery product segment includes our functional genomics, cell biology and drug discovery product lines. Functional genomics encompasses products from the initial cloning and manipulation of DNA, to examining RNA levels and regulating gene expression in cells, to capturing, separating and analyzing proteins. These include research tools used in reagent and kit form that simplify and improve gene acquisition, gene cloning, gene expression, and gene analysis techniques. This segment includes a full range of enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents. These biologics are manufactured to the highest research standards and are matched in a gene specific, validated manner (gene, orf, rnai, protein, antibodies, etc.) to ensure researchers the highest purity and scientific relevance for their experimentation. We also offer software through this segment that enables more efficient and accelerated analysis and interpretation of genomic, proteomic and other biomolecular data for application in pharmaceutical, therapeutic and diagnostic development. The recent acquisition of Zymed and proposed acquisition of Dynal have introduced and will continue to enable us to offer new technology and products, such as antibodies and proteins (Zymed) and magnetic beads used for biological separation (Dynal), which is the first step in almost every biologic investigative or diagnostic process. BioProduction. Our BioProduction product segment includes all of our cell culture products and biological testing services business. Products include sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce pharmaceuticals and other materials made through cultured cells. BioProduction services include testing to ensure that biologics are free of disease causing agents or do not cause adverse effects; characterization of products chemical structures; development of formulations for long term stability; and validation of purification processes under regulatory guidelines. We also manufacture biologics on behalf of clients both for use in clinical trials and for the worldwide commercial market. The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions, and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, energy, agricultural and chemical companies. Life sciences researchers use our reagents and informatics to perform a broad range of experiments in the laboratory. The biopharmaceutical production market consists of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that use sera and media for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of biopharmaceuticals. The selection of sera and media generally occurs early in the clinical process and continues through commercialization. Other industries consume sera and media for the commercial production of genetically engineered products including food processing and agricultural industries. Our Strategy Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery and commercial bioproduction. 21 Table of Contents Our strategies to achieve this objective include: New Product Innovation and Development Developing innovative new products. We place a great emphasis on internally developing new technologies for the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical production markets. A significant portion of our growth and current revenue base has been created by the application of technology to accelerate the drug discovery process of our customers. We expect to increase research and development spending as a percentage of sales over the next several quarters, and to focus new product development on three critical technology areas: Protein production, purification and characterization; Biochemical and cell based assays; and Labeling and detection, particularly in proteomics. In licensing technologies. We actively and selectively in license new technologies, which we modify to create high value kits, many of which address bottlenecks in the research or drug discovery laboratories. We have a dedicated group of individuals that is focused on in licensing technologies from academic and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Acquisitions. We actively and selectively seek to acquire and integrate companies with complementary products and technologies, trusted brand names, strong market positions, and strong intellectual property positions. We have acquired numerous companies since we became a public company in 1999. Our most significant acquisitions to date include Life Technologies, BioReliance, Molecular Probes, PanVera, and NOVEX. Recent significant acquisitions include: Our February 6, 2004, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of BioReliance Corporation. BioReliance is a leading contract service organization providing testing, development and manufacturing services for biologic based drugs to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The results of operations of BioReliance have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioProduction segment from the date of acquisition. Our August 20, 2003, acquisition of all outstanding shares of common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., a privately held corporation based in Eugene, Oregon. Molecular Probes is a provider of fluorescence based technologies for use in labeling molecules for biological research and drug discovery. The results of operations of Molecular Probes have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Our March 28, 2003, acquisition of products and technology rights from PanVera LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Based in Madison, Wisconsin, our PanVera business provides products and services that are designed to accelerate the discovery of new medicines by the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Through this transaction, we acquired PanVeras biochemical and cellular assay capabilities and its commercial portfolio of proprietary reagents, probes and proteins. In addition, we also acquired PanVeras research, development and manufacturing facility in Madison. The results of operations of PanVera have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. 22 Table of Contents Leverage of Existing Sales and Distribution Infrastructure Multi national sales footprint. We have developed a sales and distribution network with sales in approximately 70 countries throughout the world. Our sales force is highly trained, with many of our sales people possessing degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry or related fields. We believe our sales force has a proven track record for selling and distributing our products, and we expect to leverage this capacity to increase sales of our existing, newly developed and acquired products. We sell most of our products through our own sales force, and the remaining products are sold through agents or distributors. We currently market our products directly in over 24 countries throughout the world and sell through distributors or agents in approximately 45 additional countries. These independent distributors may also market research products for other companies, including some products that are competitive with our offerings. High customer satisfaction. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical support staffs work well together to provide our customers exceptional service for our products, and we have been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys. We use this strength to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. Rapid product delivery. We have the ability to ship typical orders on a same day or next day basis. We use this ability to provide convenient service to our customers to generate additional sales. Our BioDiscovery and BioProduction products are used for research purposes, and their use by our customers generally is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our BioProduction products and manufacturing sites, including some sites of our BioReliance subsidiary, are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities located in Carlsbad, California; Eugene, Oregon; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Auckland, New Zealand; and Paisley, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in Japan, Brazil, and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. We conduct research activities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government, and commercial institutions. Except for our oligonucleotide (custom primers), genomic services, biologics testing, specialized manufacturing, and cell culture production businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders, and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components, and in some cases, entire products. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys 23 Table of Contents functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors that may Affect Future Results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase % Increase (dollars in millions) 2004 2003 BioDiscovery revenues $ 591.4 $ 500.5 $ 90.9 18 % BioProduction revenues 432.5 277.2 155.3 56 % Total revenues $ 1,023.9 $ 777.7 $ 246.2 32 % BioDiscovery gross margin 70 % 68 % BioProduction gross margin 49 % 52 % Total gross margin 59 % 60 % When comparing 2004 revenues with 2003, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $34.8 million of the $246.2 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue growth rate by 5%. The increase in revenues also includes $173.5 million, or 22%, from our recent acquisitions: BioReliance, which we acquired in February 2004; Molecular Probes, which we acquired in August 2003; and the PanVera business, which we acquired at the end of March 2003. Higher volume and royalty revenue accounted for an additional $31.3 million or 4% increase, while higher average selling prices contributed another $6.6 million or 1%. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the euro, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $22.2 million when comparing 2004 with 2003 and accounted for 4% of the 18% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $59.9 million, or 12%, from our recent acquisitions, $11.9 million or 2% from higher volume growth and $3.2 million or 1% from higher royalty revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices of $6.3 million or 1.0%. We currently expect our BioDiscovery growth rate to be approximately 4% to 5% for 2005. BioProduction Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioProduction revenues by $12.6 million when comparing 2004 with 2003 and accounted for 4% of the 56% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $113.6 million, or 41%, primarily from our 24 Table of Contents recent acquisition of BioReliance. The remainder of the increase reflects volume growth of $16.1 million or 6%, as well as average selling price increases, particularly for sera products, which accounted for $12.9 million or 5%. We currently expect our BioProduction growth rate to be approximately 11% to 12% for 2005. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. We also believe that it is unlikely for price increases for sera products to continue, and, therefore, do not anticipate that price increases will contribute to our growth rates or gross margin as much as they have in the past three years. Gross Margin. The decrease in gross margin during 2004 when compared to 2003 reflects costs of $17.6 million, or 1% of revenues, associated with the sale during 2004 of products acquired with Molecular Probes that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. In addition, higher costs for sera products accounted for a 1% decrease in gross margin and the acquisition of BioReliance, a lower gross margin business, accounted for a 1% decrease. These decreases in gross margin are offset by a 1% increase in gross margin resulting from lower variable costs associated with productivity improvements and favorable changes in foreign currency rates, which improved margins by 1%. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements, and foreign currency rates. BioDiscovery Segment Gross Margin. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2004 when compared to 2003 is due to the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses which accounted for improved margins of 1%, a 1% increase in gross margin resulting from lower variable costs associated with productivity improvements and favorable changes in foreign currency rates which improved margins by 1%. These increases are partially offset by a 1% decrease in gross margin resulting from unfavorable changes in average selling prices. BioProduction Segment Gross Margin. The decrease in BioProduction gross margin during 2004 when compared to 2003 reflects the lower gross margin BioReliance service business, which reduced margins by 2%, and higher unit costs net of higher average selling prices for sera products, which reduced margins by 3%. These decreases are partially offset by a 2% increase in gross margin resulting from lower variable costs associated with productivity improvements. 25 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense(1) As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 126.3 21 % $ 116.1 23 % $ 10.2 General and administrative 70.7 12 % 65.6 13 % 5.1 Research and development 62.5 11 % 46.6 9 % 15.9 BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 54.2 13 % $ 38.3 14 % $ 15.9 General and administrative 39.9 9 % 22.9 8 % 17.0 Research and development 9.7 2 % 7.7 3 % 2.0 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 General and administrative 0.1 0.2 (0.1 ) Research and development 0.9 0.3 0.6 Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 180.7 18 % $ 154.5 20 % $ 26.2 General and administrative 110.7 11 % 88.7 11 % 22.0 Research and development 73.1 7 % 54.6 7 % 18.5 (1) 2004 presentation of 2003 general and administrative expenses by segment reflects reclassifications of general and administrative costs from the Corporate and Unallocated segment to the BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments to conform to our corporate expense allocation methodology applied in 2004. Sales and Marketing. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2004 as compared to 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera, which accounted for $15.6 million of the increase, changes in foreign currency rates that increased expense by $5.5 million, an increase in commissions of $2.8 million, increased headcount, and relocation and recruiting fees, which accounted for $4.8 million of the increase and $0.9 million for the impairment of an asset determined by management to be obsolete. These increases were partially offset by $2.3 million in lower advertising fees. Sales and marketing expenses for 2003 also include accelerated depreciation expense of $1.1 million for a portion of our e commerce software that was rendered obsolete by a new system in 2004. We expect to see continued productivity gains in our sales and marketing expenditures as we use product specialists to support our existing customer account managers allowing us to maintain the effectiveness of our direct selling organization while offering an ever increasing portfolio of products. General and Administrative. The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2004 as compared to 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera, which accounted for $20.3 million of the increase, costs associated with increased headcount, relocation and recruiting of $5.0 million, changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $1.8 million, and $2.0 million of costs related to the implementation of Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 internal control evaluations. These increases were partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease resulting primarily from lower legal/professional and other fees. 26 Table of Contents We continue to pursue programs and initiatives to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Research and Development. The increase in research and development expenses during 2004 as compared to 2003 reflects research and development costs associated with acquired businesses, primarily BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera, which in total accounted for $14.3 million of the increase, changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $0.5 million, and $5.2 million of increased costs associated with increased headcount, and related relocation and recruiting costs. Research and development expenses for 2003 also include accelerated amortization of purchased technology of $1.5 million. We expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues will continue to increase as we expand our capabilities to accelerate innovation and ramp up research and development of recently acquired businesses. Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for intangible assets purchased in our business acquisitions was $106.8 million for 2004 and $79.4 million for 2003. The increase in 2004 is due primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the BioReliance, Molecular Probes and PanVera acquisitions. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. Purchased in process research and development costs of $0.7 million for 2004 resulted from a 2004 acquisition that was not material to the overall consolidated financial statements and represents acquired current research and development projects in process. Purchased in process research and development costs of $1.4 million for 2003 resulted from the Molecular Probes acquisition and represents acquired research and development projects. Business Integration Costs. Business integration costs for 2003 were $1.3 million and represent an impairment loss of $0.9 million on assets held for sale in Huntsville, Alabama, related to the closure of our facilities located there, in addition to $0.4 million in costs incurred for the integration of InforMax, acquired in December 2002. These costs were for the relocation of property, closure of facilities and retention of employees. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $1.3 million from $24.0 million for 2003 to $25.3 million for 2004. The increase in interest income is due mainly to interest rates generally trending higher in 2004. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances, which could be materially reduced by acquisitions and other financing activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.6 million from $28.6 million for 2003 to $32.2 million for 2004. Our issuance of $450 million in principal amount of 1 1/2% convertible senior notes in February 2004 and $350 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes in August 2003 accounted for $10.7 million of the increase for 2004, offset by the redemption in March 2004 of $172.5 million of our 5 1/2% convertible notes, which reduced interest expense by $8.2 million. The remainder of the increase in 2004 was due mainly to interest expense of $1.1 million on our capital lease and debt obligations acquired in the BioReliance acquisition and former capital lease obligations in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt. A loss of $6.8 million was recognized during 2004 on the early retirement of our $172.5 million in principal amount of 5 1/2% convertible notes and includes $4.1 million for the call premium and $2.7 million for the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 27 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2004 and 2003, is comprised of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 Net periodic pension income (expense)(1) $ 0.4 $ (0.5 ) Gain (loss) on asset disposals (0.8 ) Gain (loss) on the sale of our Serva subsidiary(2) 0.9 Gain on sale of an investment 0.3 Impairment loss on vacant land (0.6 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) (0.4 ) 0.1 Total other income (expense), net $ (0.8 ) $ 0.2 (1) The net periodic pension income and expense is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who were not continuing employees of Invitrogen following the merger. (2) The gain was recognized in June 2003 on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, which was sold in 2002, resulting from the collection of cash on a note receivable from the sale that was fully reserved for at the time of the sale. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 26.8% for 2004 compared with 28.6% for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a reduction of income tax on foreign income that resulted from restructuring the ownership of certain foreign businesses to achieve better alignment with our operational and management structure, offset in part by an increase in the proportion of income earned in tax jurisdictions having higher tax rates. In October 2004, the President signed the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004, which retroactively reinstated the research credit for qualifying activities arising after June 30, 2004. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, the effect of the change in tax law is recognized in the period that the new legislation was enacted, which is the fourth quarter of 2004. The additional research credit reduced income tax expense $0.9 million or 0.7%. In October 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which, among other things, prospectively phases out the extraterritorial income deduction, provides for certain domestic manufacturing tax relief, reforms the foreign tax credit regime, and allows for tax favored repatriation of international earnings. Many of the new tax provisions have an effective date beginning in 2005. The impact of this law change to our 2004 income tax expense is not significant. 28 Table of Contents Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Revenues For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase % Increase (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 BioDiscovery revenues $ 500.5 $ 428.9 $ 71.6 17% BioProduction revenues 277.2 219.7 57.5 26% Total revenues $ 777.7 $ 648.6 $ 129.1 20% BioDiscovery gross margin 68% 62% BioProduction gross margin 52% 51% Total gross margin 60% 58% When comparing 2003 revenues with 2002, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues, accounting for $40.6 million of the $129.1 million increase. This increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue growth rate by 6%. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 7%, from our recent acquisitions: InforMax, which we acquired in December 2002; the PanVera business which we acquired at the end of March 2003; and Molecular Probes which we acquired in August 2003. Higher volume accounted for an additional 3% increase, while higher prices contributed another 4%. BioDiscovery Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioDiscovery revenues by $24.1 million when comparing 2003 with 2002 and accounted for 6% of the 17% increase in revenues. The increase in revenues also includes $46.4 million, or 11%, from our recent acquisitions. BioProduction Segment Revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar denominated BioProduction revenues by $16.5 million when comparing the year ended December 30, 2003, with 2002 and accounted for 8% of the 26% increase in revenues. The remainder of the increase reflects volume growth of 9% driven by our large scale production applications, as well as price increases, particularly for sera products, which accounted for 9%. Gross Margin. The increase in gross margin during 2003 when compared to 2002 reflects the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses during 2003, which accounted for improved margins of 2%, favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which accounted for improved margins of 1%, and higher prices which accounted for improved margins 1%. These margin improvements were offset by costs of $15.1 million, or 2%, associated with the sale during 2003 of products acquired in our business combinations that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. BioDiscovery Segment Gross Margin. The increase in BioDiscovery gross margin during 2003 is due to favorable changes in product mix and net cost improvements which improved margins by 3%, the addition of higher margin products from acquired businesses which accounted for improved margins of 2% and favorable changes in foreign currency rates which improved margins by 1%. BioProduction Segment Gross Margin. Higher average selling prices increasing at a faster rate than costs in both our sera and non sera product lines accounted for a 3% improvement in BioProduction gross margin during 2003. Favorable changes in foreign currency rates improved margins by 1% and unfavorable changes in mix reduced gross margins by 2%. 29 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) OperatingExpense(1) As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense(1) As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 116.1 23 % $ 94.9 22 % $ 21.2 General and administrative 65.6 13 % 50.6 12 % 15.0 Research and development 46.6 9 % 27.8 6 % 18.8 BioProduction Segment: Sales and marketing $ 38.3 14 % $ 29.9 14 % $ 8.4 General and administrative 22.9 8 % 20.4 9 % 2.5 Research and development 7.7 3 % 5.9 3 % 1.8 Corporate: Sales and marketing $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ General and administrative 0.2 0.1 0.1 Research and development 0.3 0.3 Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 154.5 20 % $ 124.9 19 % $ 29.6 General and administrative 88.7 11 % 71.1 11 % 17.6 Research and development 54.6 7 % 33.7 5 % 20.9 (1) 2004 presentation of 2003 and 2002 general and administrative expenses by segment reflects reclassifications of general and administrative costs from the Corporate and Unallocated segment to the BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments to conform to our corporate expense allocation methodology applied in 2004. Sales and Marketing. The absolute increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2003 is due to: expenses of our acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera, and Molecular Probes, which accounted for $10.6 million of the increase; increased headcount, compensation and selling activities which accounted for $12.8 million of the increase, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expense by $5.2 million. Sales and marketing expenses for 2003 also include accelerated depreciation expense of $1.1 million for a portion of our e commerce software that will be rendered obsolete by a new system in 2004. General and Administrative. The absolute increase in general and administrative expenses during 2003 is due to costs associated with the acquired businesses of InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase; higher legal costs of $4.4 million; costs associated with the transition in the chief executive officer position which accounted for $1.5 million; increased headcount and related spending and business insurance of $5.3 million, and changes in foreign currency rates that increased expenses by $2.2 million. These costs are partially offset by cost reductions during 2003 of $2.8 million from the closure of our operations in Alabama in April 2002 and the sale of our Serva entity in June 2002. Research and Development. The increase in research and development expenses during 2003 reflects: software development costs for the InforMax business, research and development costs associated with Molecular Probes acquisition and the PanVera business acquired which in total accounted for $13.0 million of the increase; increased headcount and related spending as we continued to fill research and development positions in Carlsbad which accounted for $6.1 million of the increase and deferred compensation expense of $0.3 million from stock options assumed in the Molecular Probes acquisition. Research and development 30 Table of Contents expenses for 2003 also include accelerated amortization of purchased technology of $1.5 million for which management has determined that there is limited opportunity to develop commercial applications. Additional catch up depreciation expense of $0.9 million was recognized in 2003 for a building that was removed from service in April 2002 and held for sale until November 2003 when our strategy changed to reactivate the facility for research and development activities. Higher expense for grants accounted for another $0.5 million increase for 2003. These increases were partially offset by the closure of our Alabama facility and the sale of our Serva entity that reduced research and development costs by $1.5 million in 2003. Other Purchased Intangibles Amortization. Amortization expense for other intangible assets purchased in our business acquisitions was $79.4 million for 2003, and $64.3 million for 2002. The increase in 2003 is due primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in the InforMax, PanVera and Molecular Probes acquisitions. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. Purchased in process research and development costs of $1.4 million for 2003 resulted from the Molecular Probes acquisition and represent acquired current research and development projects in process. Business Integration Costs. Merger related business integration costs for 2003 were $1.3 million and represent an additional impairment loss of $0.9 million on assets held for sale in Huntsville, Alabama, related to the closure of our facilities located there in addition to $0.4 million in costs incurred for the integration of InforMax, acquired in December 2002. These costs were for the relocation of property, closure of facilities and retention of employees. Business integration costs for 2002 were $16.2 million and include $13.9 million from the integration of our Alabama operations with the rest of the company. The integration costs include $9.2 million in impairment losses on facilities, equipment and notes receivable, $3.9 million in severance and relocation costs and $0.8 million in other costs to close the facilities and relocate equipment. Business integration costs for 2002 also include costs for restructuring and integrating the operations of InforMax and Life Technologies into Invitrogen which are comprised of $1.6 million for the retention of former Life Technologies employees in Maryland, $0.6 million to relocate property as we transitioned employees, functions and property from Maryland to California during the first half of 2002 and $0.1 million in restructuring consultants. Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $3.4 million from $27.4 million for 2002, to $24.0 million for 2003. The reduction in interest income is due mainly to lower interest rates. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $4.5 million from $24.1 million for 2002 to $28.6 million for 2003. Our issuance of $350 million in principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes in August 2003 increased interest expense by $3.1 million for 2003. The remainder of the increase in 2003 was due mainly to $0.7 million of imputed interest on unfavorable lease obligations acquired in the InforMax acquisition and interest expense of $0.4 million on our capital lease obligation acquired in the Molecular Probes acquisition. 31 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2003 and 2002, is comprised of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Net periodic pension income (expense)(1) $ (0.5 ) $ 1.3 Gain (loss) on the sale of our Serva subsidiary(2) 0.9 (0.5 ) Gain on sale of an investment 0.3 Impairment loss on vacant land (0.6 ) Loss on the sale of our Indian subsidiary (0.3 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 0.1 (1.1 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 0.2 $ (0.6 ) (1) The net periodic pension income and expense is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who were not continuing employees of Invitrogen following the merger. (2) The gain was recognized in June 2003 on the sale of our Serva subsidiary, which was sold in 2002, resulting from the collection of cash on a note receivable from the sale that was fully reserved for at the time of the sale. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was 28.6% for 2003 compared with 31.2% for 2002. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to additional tax credits for research expenditures incurred in 2003 and an increase in the proportion of income earned in tax jurisdictions having lower tax rates. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash of $252.7 million during 2004 primarily from our net income of $88.8 million plus net non cash charges of $147.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net $16.7 million of cash during the period, driven primarily by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $17.8 million, a decrease in inventories of $11.3 million, and an increase of income taxes payable of $11.5 million offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $19.8 million. The growth of accounts receivable resulted from an increase in revenues as well as from a higher proportion of 2004 fourth quarter sales recognized at the end of the quarter compared with a lower proportion of 2003 fourth quarter sales recognized at the end of the quarter. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulted from higher compensation related accruals, interest and legal accruals, as well as an increase in cash flow hedging activities. The decrease in inventories reflects the amortization of costs of $17.6 million, associated with the sale during 2004 of products acquired in our business combinations that were previously written up under purchase accounting rules. As a result of working capital improvement programs we expect to utilize more efficiently our working capital in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal, and, on an interim basis during the year, may require short term working capital needs. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2004, was $689.5 million, and reflects a net $520.8 million paid for our business acquisitions, a net $121.8 million invested in marketable securities with maturities greater than three months and payments for capital expenditures and intangible assets (primarily intellectual properties), which totaled $39.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. These uses were partially offset by $1.3 million in cash received from the sale of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility. For 2005, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate $55 million. 32 Table of Contents In 2005, we completed two acquisitions that were not material to our overall consolidated financial statements. The aggregate cash purchase price of these acquisitions is expected to be approximately $68 million. The results of operations will be included in our future consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. In addition, on February 8, 2005, Invitrogen entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding securities of Dynal Biotechnologies Holding ASA for approximately NOK 2.5 Billion (approximately $390 million). The transaction is subject to the completion of certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval in Germany, and is expected to close during March 2005. In 2004, we completed three acquisitions that were not material to the overall consolidated financial statements. The total aggregate cash purchase price was $58.3 million and cash of $3.3 million was acquired. The results of operations were included from the respective dates of acquisition. In February 2004, we acquired all of the common stock of BioReliance Corporation for a total cash purchase price of $433.3 million, plus the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $70.4 million and transaction costs of $3.3 million. The purchase price was paid from existing cash and investments. In February 2004, we paid down $49.6 million of the acquired debt. In August 2003, we completed our acquisition of the common stock of Molecular Probes, Inc., for cash of $307.4 million. We also paid $2.4 million in closing costs, $3.3 million in severance costs and acquired cash totaling $7.3 million. In March 2003, we completed our acquisition of products and technology rights of PanVera for $94.9 million in cash and the assumption of $6.3 million in debt, which we subsequently paid off in May 2003. As part of the transaction, we have also acquired PanVeras research and development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Other cash costs in connection with this transaction include $1.3 million paid to buy out operating leases to acquire equipment and $1.8 million in closing costs. In 2003, we entered into three acquisitions that were not material to the overall consolidated financial statements, one of which included the acquisition of the remaining 60% ownership in a consolidated subsidiary. The purchases totaled $9.9 million in addition to the return of the selling partners capital account for the 60% interest described above. Beginning in July 2003 we no longer report a minority interest adjustment in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Pursuant to the purchase agreements for certain 2004 and 2003 acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on certain operating results of the acquired companies. Payments aggregating a maximum of $118.5 and certain other payments based upon percentages of future gross sales of the acquired companies could be required through 2008. We will account for any such contingent payments as an addition to the respective purchase price. Effective December 31, 2003, based upon a reevaluation of funding for our acquisition strategies, we changed our intent from holding our marketable securities to maturity, to holding our securities as available for sale. The change resulted in a reclassification of $579.3 million from securities classified as held to maturity to securities held available for sale and the recognition of net unrealized gains of $1.2 million in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $232.9 million for 2004, and includes $438.9 million in net proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes in February 2004 and $61.3 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans. This net cash in flow was offset by $81.3 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and $186.0 million used to retire debt including $176.6 million used in March 2004 to retire our 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 5 1/2% Notes, due 2007, and pay the call premium as well as $5.6 million in cash was paid towards the purchase of the Molecular Probes campus in Eugene, Oregon. 33 Table of Contents On February 19, 2004, we issued $450.0 million principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 1 1/2% Notes) due 2024, to certain qualified institutional buyers. Interest on the Old 1 1/2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 15th and August 15th. In addition to the coupon interest of 1 1/2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 1 1/2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 4.4 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $102.03 per share. The Old 1 1/2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after February 15, 2012, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 1 1/2% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 1 1/2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on February 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022. We have $350.0 million principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 2% Notes) due August 1, 2023. Interest on the Old 2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 1st and August 1st. In addition to the coupon interest of 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the notes may be required to be paid beginning August 1, 2010, if the market value of the notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.1 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $68.24 per share. The Old 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after August 1, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 2% Notes may require Invitrogen to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2013, and August 1, 2018. In December 2004, we offered up to $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the New 2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 83% of the Old 2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 2% Notes. Additionally, Invitrogen offered up to $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the New 1 1/2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 1 1/2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 91% of the Old 1 1/2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 1 1/2% Notes. The New 2% Notes and New 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the New Notes) carry the same rights and attributes as the Old 2% Notes and Old 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the Old Notes) except for the following; the terms of the New Notes required Invitrogen to settle the par value of such notes in cash and deliver shares only for the differential between the stock price on the date of conversion and the base conversion price (initially approximately $68.24 for New 2% Notes and $102.03 for the New 1 1/2% Notes). We have $500.0 million principal amount of 2 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or 2 1/4% Notes, due 2006, outstanding at December 31, 2004. Interest on the 2 1/4% Notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th. The 2 1/4% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value, and are convertible into 5.8 million shares of common stock at the option of any holder at any time at a price of $86.10 per share. The 2 1/4% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after December 20, 2005 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the Old Notes, New Notes, and the 2 1/4% Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over a three year period ending in 2005. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $100.0 million during 2002. During 2004, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $81.3 million. All repurchases have been reported as a reduction in stockholders equity as treasury stock. The timing and price of any repurchase will depend on market conditions and other factors. Funds for any future repurchases are expected to come primarily from cash generated from operations, or funds on hand. 34 Table of Contents We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery and BioProduction platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $198.4 million, short term investments of $779.3 million and long term investments of $109.1 million. Our working capital totaled over $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2004, and includes restricted cash and investments of $5.7 million. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, corporate notes, municipal notes and bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and government agency notes. As of December 31, 2004, foreign subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Japan and New Zealand had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $8.9 million, of which $1.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2004. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least 12 months and the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period(1) (in thousands) Total Less than1 Year Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than5 Years Long term debt $ 1,325,281 $ 11,429 $ 512,976 $ 876 $ 800,000 Capital lease obligations 8,858 1,077 1,579 3,702 2,500 Operating lease obligations 94,502 15,675 23,904 19,040 35,883 Licensing and purchase obligations 34,883 13,517 19,321 1,780 265 Deferred compensation 1,678 282 568 255 573 Total $ 1,465,202 $ 41,980 $ 558,348 $ 25,653 $ 839,221 (1) Pursuant to certain acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on certain operating results of the acquired companies. Payments aggregating a maximum of $117.3 million and certain other payments based upon percentages of future gross sales and milestones of the acquired companies could be required through 2008. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title to the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $19.1 million at December 31, 2004. 35 Table of Contents We recognize royalty revenue (including upfront licensing fees) when the amounts are earned and determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis, as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and or remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $17.8 million, $10.7 million and $5.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We recognize revenue from commercial contracts, which are principally fixed price or fixed rate, using the proportional performance method, except for services that are generally completed within three days, which are accounted for using the completed contract method. Proportional performance is determined using expected output milestones. The proportional performance may be affected by future events, including delays caused by laboratory interruptions, client mandated changes and the unpredictability of biological processes. Accordingly, we undertake a review process to determine that recorded revenue represents the actual proportional performance in all material respects. Revenue recorded under proportional performance for projects in process is not intended to, and does not necessarily, represent the amount of revenue that we could recover from the client if any project failed or was cancelled. We undertake a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects. We recognize revenue from government contracts, which are principally cost plus fixed fee, in amounts equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro rata portion of the earned fee. We provide for losses when they become known. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the financial condition of that customer or in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $171.0 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.2 million at December 31, 2004. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. Generally stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions 36 Table of Contents or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Gross inventories were stated at $149.5 million at December 31, 2004, and reserves for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory were $26.7 million at December 31, 2004. Valuation of goodwill. We are required to perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. We completed our most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2004, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Our evaluation included management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review from July 2004. Key assumptions from this strategic review included revenue growth, with higher net income growth. This growth was based on increased sales of new products as we expect to increase our investment in research and development, the full year effect and growth from business acquisitions already consummated, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Additional value creators assumed included increased efficiencies in working capital as well as increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 10%. Operating mechanisms to ensure that these growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized were also proposed as part of the internal strategic review and considered in our evaluation. Our market capitalization at October 1, 2004, was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis. We cannot assure you that when we complete our future annual or other periodic reviews for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2004. 37 Table of Contents Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets, which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2004, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $432.7 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $222.2 million. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, or SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $3.0 million at December 31, 2004, the majority of which we expect to pay during 2005. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from certain former business operations of Dexter, which was acquired in 2000. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in 38 Table of Contents the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves, which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $10.0 million at December 31, 2004. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors, among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, reversing deferred tax liabilities, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our BioDiscovery and BioProduction segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our shared assets to the individual segments. Pro forma Stock Based Compensation. We provide pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts in accordance with the disclosure only provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The stock based compensation expense used in these pro forma amounts is based on the fair value of the option at the grant date which uses the present value pricing method described in SFAS No. 123. This method requires us to use several assumptions to estimate the fair value, including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected life. Should any of these assumptions change or differ from the actual life or actual stock price volatility, our pro forma results could differ substantially. 39 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature, and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations, and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, were over $1.0 billion using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2003 to our non U.S. revenues for 2004 would result in $34.8 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected, and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $(0.4) million, $0.1 million and ($1.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2004, we had $13.8 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific receivables and payables. These contracts, which all settled on various dates through January 2005, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific 40 Table of Contents receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. At December 31, the notional principal and fair value of Invitrogens outstanding foreign currency derivatives to hedge the value of its foreign currency receivables and payables were as follows: 2004 2003 (in millions) Notional Principal Fair Value Notional Principal Fair Value Forward exchange contracts $ 13.8 $ (0.05 ) $ 44.01 $ (0.20 ) The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end, and does not represent the amount of Invitrogens exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. In addition to hedging the value of our foreign currency receivables and payables, our foreign currency hedging program includes hedging of forecasted foreign currency cash flows. At December 31, 2004, the value of our executed forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign currency cash flows totaled $164.9 million. The contracts mature on various dates through 2005. The contracts increase or decrease in value prior to their maturity will be accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent any portion of the forward contracts is determined to not be an effective hedge, the increase or decrease in value prior to the maturity will be recorded in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the cash flow hedge contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2004, a 10% decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies under contract would result in an approximate $16.5 million unrealized loss. Conversely, a 10% increase in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies under contract would result in a $16.5 million unrealized gain. Consistent with the nature of the economic hedge provided by these foreign exchange contracts, such unrealized gains or losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases, respectively, in the dollar value of the future foreign currency cash flows. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $198.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would, however, decrease or increase, respectively, the remaining $888.4 million of our investments by approximately $6.8 million. While changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment. 41 Table of Contents In February 2004, we acquired BioReliance Corporation, which did utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2004, there is one outstanding interest rate swap that was entered into by BioReliance. This instrument swapped floating rate LIBOR payments to fixed rate payments. The current notional amount of this swap is $4.1 million. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See discussion under Market Risk in Item 7.
