Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of research tools in reagent, kit and high throughput application forms to customers engaged in life sciences research, drug discovery, diagnostics and the commercial manufacture of biological products. Additionally we are a leading supplier of sera, cell and tissue culture media and reagents used in life sciences research, as well as in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and produce pharmaceuticals and other high valued proteins. We conduct our business through two principal segments: BioDiscovery. Our BioDiscovery segment includes molecular biology, cell biology and drug discovery product lines. Molecular biology encompasses products from the initial cloning and manipulation of DNA, to examining RNA levels and regulating gene expression in cells, to capturing, separating and analyzing proteins. These include the research tools used in reagent and kit form that simplify and improve gene acquisition, gene cloning, gene expression and gene analysis techniques. This segment also includes a full range of enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents. These biologics are manufactured to the highest research standards and are matched in a gene specific, validated manner (gene, ORF, RNAi, protein, antibodies, etc.) to ensure researchers the highest purity and scientific relevance for their experimentation. We also offer software through this segment that enables more efficient, accelerated analysis and interpretation of genomic, proteomic and other biomolecular data for application in pharmaceutical, therapeutic and diagnostic development. The acquisitions of Zymed, Caltag, Dynal and Biosource have enhanced our ability to offer new technology and products, such as antibodies and proteins (Zymed, Caltag and BioSource) and magnetic beads used for biological separation (Dynal), which is the first step in almost every biologic investigative or diagnostic process. Cell Systems (CS). Our CS segment includes all of our GIBCO cell culture products and services. Products include sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce biopharmaceuticals and other end products made through cultured cells. CS services include the creation of commercially viable stable cell lines and the optimization of production processes used for the production of therapeutic drugs. The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, energy, agricultural and chemical companies. Life sciences researchers use our reagents and informatics to perform a broad range of experiments in the laboratory. The biopharmaceutical production market consists of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that use sera and media for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of biopharmaceuticals. The selection of sera and media generally occurs early in the clinical process and continues through commercialization. Other industries consume sera and media for the commercial production of genetically engineered products including food processing and agricultural industries. Our Strategy Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery and commercial bio production. 24 Table of Contents Our strategies to achieve this objective include: New Product Innovation and Development Developing innovative new products. We place a great emphasis on internally developing new technologies for the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical production markets. Additionally, we are looking to leverage the broad range of our technologies to create unique synergistic technology solutions across our internal and newly acquired research and development centers of excellence. A significant portion of our growth and current revenue base has been created by the application of technology to accelerate the drug discovery process of our customers. We expect to focus new product development on three critical technology areas: Protein and antibody production, purification and characterization; Biochemical and cell based assays; and Labeling and detection,. In licensing technologies. We actively and selectively in license new technologies, which we modify to create high value kits, many of which address bottlenecks in the research or drug discovery laboratories. We have a dedicated group of individuals that is focused on in licensing technologies from academic and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Acquisitions. We actively and selectively seek to acquire and integrate companies with complementary products and technologies, trusted brand names, strong market positions and strong intellectual property positions. We have acquired numerous companies since we became a public company in 1999. On April 1, 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Dynal Biotech Holding AS, a privately held corporation based in Oslo, Norway for cash of $402.6 million. Dynal is the industry leader in magnetic bead technologies that are used in cell separation and purification, cell stimulation, protein research, nucleic acid research and microbiology. The results of operations of Dynal are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Additionally we have entered into other immaterial acquisitions which are further discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Divestitures. In April 2007, Invitrogen completed the sale of its BioReliance subsidiary to Avista Capital Partners and received net cash proceeds of approximately $209.0 million. No loss on the sale was recorded in 2007. The results of operations for BioReliance for the period from January through April 2007 and the results for all prior periods are reported as discontinued operations. The Company finalized the sale of BioSource Europe, S.A., a diagnostic business located in Belgium, in April of, 2007, to a private investor group in Belgium for proceeds of $5.5 million. Net proceeds from both acquisitions less cash spent as part of the disposal process were $209.9 million. Leverage Existing Sales, Distribution and Manufacturing Infrastructure Multi national sales footprint. We have developed a sales and distribution network with sales in approximately 70 countries throughout the world. Our sales force is highly trained, with many of our sales people possessing degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry or related fields. We believe our sales force has a proven track record for selling and distributing our products and we expect to leverage this capacity to increase sales of our existing, newly developed and acquired products. High degree of customer satisfaction. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical support staff work well together to provide our customers exceptional service for our products and we have been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys. We use this strength to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. 25 Table of Contents Rapid product delivery. We have the ability to ship typical orders on a same day or next day basis. We use this ability to provide convenient service to our customers to generate additional sales. Our BioDiscovery and CS products are used for research purposes and their use by our customers generally is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our CS and antibody products and manufacturing sites are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001 and ISO 13458. We conduct research activities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government and commercial institutions. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities located in Carlsbad and Camarillo, California; Eugene, Oregon; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Auckland, New Zealand; Oslo, Norway; and Paisley, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in Japan and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. Except for our oligonucleotide (custom primers), genomic services, biologics testing, specialized manufacturing and cell culture production businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components and in some cases, entire products. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected and will continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors Related to Our Operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions) 2007 2006 $ Increase/(Decrease) % Increase/(Decrease) BioDiscovery revenues $ 902.2 $ 814.7 $ 87.5 11 % Cell Systems revenues 379.5 336.5 43.0 13 % Total revenues $ 1,281.7 $ 1,151.2 $ 130.5 11 % BioDiscovery gross margin 70 % 68 % Cell Systems gross margin 50 % 52 % Total gross margin 56 % 53 % 26 Table of Contents Revenues Revenues increased $130.5 million or 11% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily a result of $59.7 million of increased volume and new product revenue, $40.6 million in foreign currency translation, and $29.8 million of price increases. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Norwegian kroner, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery revenues increased $87.5 million or 11% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily driven by $29.4 million in increased volume and new product revenue, $28.6 million in increased prices and a favorable impact of $28.9 million in foreign currency translation. Cell Systems (CS). CS revenues increased $43.0 million or 13% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily a result of increased volume and new product revenue of $30.3 million along with favorable impact of $11.7 million in foreign currency translation. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $107.6 million or 18% for 2007 compared to 2006. Gross profit for 2007 and 2006 included approximately $0.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of costs associated with the write up of acquired inventory to fair market value as a result of a business combination. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, this acquired inventory was written up to fair market value and subsequently expensed as the inventory was sold. Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $98.7 million for 2007 compared to $110.7 million for 2006. The $12.0 million decrease was mainly due to intangible assets acquired in prior periods being fully amortized during the year. The primary drivers for the increase in gross margin is related to $47.5 million in pricing and volume increases, $22.1 million in productivity increases and $26.4 million in favorable foreign currency impacts. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements and foreign currency rates. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery gross margin increased 2% to 70% for 2007 compared to 68% in 2006 primarily due to lower operating costs, improved pricing and increased sales volume. Cell Systems (CS). CS gross margin decreased 2% to 50% for 2007 compared to 52% in 2006. Declines in gross margin were primarily the result of higher operating expenses and declines in sera pricing. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues $ Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 185.1 21 % $ 172.8 21 % $ 12.3 7 % General and administrative 105.2 12 % 93.2 11 % 12.0 13 % Research and development 97.2 11 % 89.7 11 % 7.5 8 % Cell Systems Segment: Sales and marketing $ 60.9 16 % $ 54.5 16 % $ 6.4 12 % General and administrative 39.2 10 % 30.2 9 % 9.0 30 % Research and development 14.5 4 % 10.4 3 % 4.1 39 % Unallocated: Sales and marketing $ 6.0 $ 5.1 $ 0.9 General and administrative 19.7 26.7 (7.0 ) Research and development 4.1 4.2 (0.1 ) Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 252.0 20 % $ 232.4 20 % $ 19.6 8 % General and administrative 164.1 13 % 150.1 13 % 14.0 9 % Research and development 115.8 9 % 104.3 9 % 11.5 11 % Sales and Marketing. For 2007, sales and marketing expenses increased $19.6 million or 8% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increased salaries and bonuses of $13.2 million, $4.5 million of additional purchased services expenses and $6.0 million of foreign currency translation impacts. This was partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses of $3.9 million as well as a decrease in supplies expenses of $1.4 million. General and Administrative. For 2007, general and administrative expenses increased $14.0 million or 9% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increases salaries and bonuses of $23.1 million, additional depreciation expense of $4.7 million which was driven by increased capital expenditures, $1.6 million in increases of travel expenses and $2.1 million of foreign currency translation impacts. This was partially offset by a decrease of $7.0 in stock based compensation expense, $5.8 million in purchased services expenses, $1.4 million in bad debt expenses and $4.3 million in other expenses. We continue to pursue programs and initiatives to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Research and Development. Research and development expenses for 2007 increased $11.5 million or 11% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from $5.4 million of salaries and bonus expenses, $1.4 million in increased purchase services expenses, $1.4 million in other expenses and $1.5 million in foreign currency translation expenses. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in supplies expense. Overall, gross research and development expenses increased 11 percent year over year as a result of our continued efforts to drive growth through new product development projects. We expect research and development expenses to remain at this level as a percentage of sales as we continue efforts to drive growth through new product development. Business Consolidation Costs. Business consolidation costs for 2007 were $5.6 million, compared to $12.5 million in 2006, and represent costs associated with our efforts to realign our business and consolidation of certain facilities. These costs consisted mainly of termination benefits of certain employees involuntarily terminated. We expect to continue to incur business consolidation costs in 2008 as we further consolidate operations and facilities. 28 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Interest Income. Interest income was $28.0 million in 2007 compared to $26.7 million in 2006. The $1.3 million increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average yield of our investments in 2007, partially offset by the effect of lower investment balances due to the payoff of the 2006 2 1/4% Convertible Notes and the share repurchase program. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances, which may materially increase or decrease as a result of acquisitions, stock repurchase programs and other financing activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $28.0 million for 2007 compared to $32.2 million for 2006. The primary reason for the $4.2 million reduction in interest expense was the maturity of the 2006 2 1/4% Convertible Notes in the prior year which were not part of the 2007 expense. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2007 and 2006 was comparable at $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of our pre tax income was 27.1% for 2007 compared with 27.2% of our pre tax income for 2006. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in income earned in jurisdictions having lower tax rates. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in millions) 2006 2005 $ Increase/(Decrease) % Increase/(Decrease) BioDiscovery revenues $ 814.7 $ 732.0 $ 82.7 11 % Cell Systems revenues 336.5 347.1 (10.6 ) (3 %) Total revenues $ 1,151.2 $ 1,079.1 $ 72.1 7 % BioDiscovery gross margin 68 % 70 % Cell Systems gross margin 52 % 50 % Total gross margin 53 % 51 % Revenues Revenues increased $72.1 million or 7% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily a result of $61.7 million of increased volume and acquisition related revenue, $28.0 million of price and royalty revenue increases and $2.4 million in foreign currency translation. The increases were partially offset by declines of $21.7 million due to sera products. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Norwegian kroner, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery revenues increased $82.7 million or 11% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily driven by $56.9 million in increased volume and acquisition related revenue and $26.0 million in increased prices and higher royalty revenue. 29 Table of Contents Cell Systems (CS). CS revenues decreased $10.6 million or 3% for 2006 compared to 2005. The decline was primarily a result of $21.7 million of decreased volume and pricing within the sera business, partially offset by $6.9 million of pricing and volume increases in cell culture research. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $58.8 million or 11% for 2006 compared to 2005. Gross profit for 2006 and 2005 included approximately $4.4 million and $30.0 million, respectively, of costs associated with the write up of acquired inventory to fair market value as a result of a business combination. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, this acquired inventory was written up to fair market value and subsequently expensed as the inventory was sold. The impact of these inventory revaluations had a neutral impact on our overall gross profit when comparing 2006 to 2005. Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $110.7 million for 2006 compared to $110.4 million for 2005. The $0.3 million increase was mainly due to intangible assets acquired through our acquisitions, partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized during 2006. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery gross margin decreased 2% to 68% for 2006 compared to 70% in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to lower margin products being sold in connection with acquired companies and collaborations and decreased manufacturing efficiencies. Cell Systems (CS). CS gross margin increased 2% to 52% for 2006 compared to 50% in 2005. Increased pricing in cell culture research was the primary driver for the increase in the margins.

For 2006, sales and marketing expenses increased $28.4 million or 14% compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from increased salaries and commissions of $13.8 million, $10.9 million of incremental expenses related to acquisitions, $5.1 million from share based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, foreign currency translation of $1.9 million and travel expenses of $3.4 million, partially offset by a $6.4 million reduction in incentive compensation. General and Administrative. For 2006, general and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million or 27% compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from $8.0 million of incremental expenses related to acquisitions, increased salaries and other expenses of $5.9 million and $26.6 million from share based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, partially offset by a $8.8 million reduction in incentive compensation. Research and Development. Research and development expenses for 2006 increased $6.5 million or 7% compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from $8.4 million of incremental expenses related to acquisitions, share based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123R of $3.8 million partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation of $4.7 million. Overall, research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was comparable to the prior year. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. In conjunction with our acquisitions in 2005, we purchased in process research and development projects valued at $17.0 million that were expensed upon their respective acquisition dates. There was no expense related to in process research and development in 2006. Business Consolidation Costs. Business consolidation costs for 2006 were $12.5 million and represent costs associated with our efforts to realign our business and consolidation of certain facilities. These costs consisted mainly of termination benefits of certain employees involuntarily terminated. Other Income (Expense) Interest Income. Interest income was $26.7 million in 2006 compared to $24.6 million in 2005. The $2.1 million increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average yield of our investments in 2006, partially offset by the effect of lower investment balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $32.2 million for 2006 compared to $34.0 million for 2005. The primary reason for the $1.8 million reduction in interest expense was open market repurchases of our 2 1/4% senior convertible notes, which reduced the average balance of our debt in 2006 compared to 2005. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2006 and 2005, is composed of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Net periodic pension (expense) income(1) $ (0.7 ) $ 0.9 Gain (loss) on asset disposals 2.3 (0.1 ) Gain on forward contract(2) 21.0 Recognition of cumulative translation gains(3) 25.5 Gain on sale of an equity investment 2.8 Foreign currency gain on short term intercompany loan 2.2 Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains (1.6 ) 0.3 Other 0.5 4.9 Total other income, net $ 0.5 $ 57.5 (1) The net periodic pension income is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who were not continuing employees of Invitrogen following the merger. 31 Table of Contents (2) The gain was recognized in March 2005 on the settlement of a forward contract related to the acquisition of Dynal. (3) Relates to the repatriation of $119.0 million of undistributed earnings from and substantial liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in the recognition of $25.5 million of cumulative translation gains. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of our pre tax income was 27.2% for 2006 compared with 23.9% of our pre tax income for 2005. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher primarily because tax expense in 2005 included the effect of a repatriation of foreign earnings that qualified for the reduced rate of tax as provided in The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). The tax incurred in 2005 included a benefit upon the repatriation of those foreign earnings that was lower than the tax liability recorded prior to the enactment of the AJCA. Discontinued Operations. In April 2007, we completed the sale of our BioReliance business unit, a component of the CS reporting unit, to Avista Capital Partners for approximately $210.0 million. In addition, in February 2007, we finalized the sale of BioSource Europe S.A., a diagnostic business in our BioDiscovery reporting unit. These operations were deemed to be discontinued operations and the results from these business divisions have been excluded from our continuing operations financial statements. Discontinued operations results for 2006 were a loss of $266.8 million compared to net income in the prior year of $10.6 million. The change year over year is primarily attributable to goodwill impairment of $270.4 million in 2006 as indicators determined the value of goodwill to be less than the carrying value. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash of $323.6 million during 2007 primarily from our net income of $143.2 million plus net non cash charges of $179.4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net increase of $0.9 million in cash during the period. Within the non cash charges which provided cash, the primary drivers were amortization of intangible assets of $98.7 million, share based compensation of $42.5 million and depreciation charges of $37.4 million. The primary drivers of cash proceeds from changes in operating assets and liabilities were an increase in income taxes payable of $14.6 million, increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20.5 million which were partially offset by increases in inventories of $19.8 million and increases in prepaid and other assets of $11.4 million. As a result of working capital improvement programs, we expect to utilize our working capital more effectively in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal and, on an interim basis during the year, may require an influx of short term working capital. Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities during 2007 was $48.5 million. The primary increase was related to cash proceeds from the sale of our BioReliance and BioSource Europe divisions which increased cash by $209.9 million. This increase in cash was offset by net purchases of securities of $51.8 million, purchases of property plant and equipment of $78.3 million and cash paid for business combinations of $31.3 million. For 2008, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate 2007 spending. In 2007, we completed two acquisitions immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements. The net cash purchase price of acquisitions in 2007 was $31.2 million, of which $23.1 million related to acquisitions completed in 2007. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition and were not material to our consolidated financial results. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents In late 2006, we completed an acquisition immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements. The net cash purchase price of acquisitions in 2006 was $44.0 million, of which $15.1 million was related to the acquisition completed in 2006. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition and were not material to our consolidated financial results. In April 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Dynal for a total cash purchase price of $347.3 million. We also paid cash to extinguish $53.1 million of debt following completion of the acquisition and transaction costs of $2.2 million and acquired cash of $1.1 million. The purchase price was paid from existing cash and investments. In 2005, we completed several other acquisitions that were not material to our overall consolidated financial statements. The aggregate cash purchase price of these acquisitions was $256.5 million and acquired cash totaling $18.1 million. The results of operations were included from the respective dates of acquisition. Pursuant to the purchase agreements for certain prior year and current year acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on the achievement of future gross sales of the acquired companies through 2010. The agreements do not limit the payment to a maximum amount. The Company will account for such contingent payments as an addition to the purchase price of the acquired company. Payments aggregating a maximum of $5.0 million based upon certain research and development milestones of the acquired companies could be required through 2008. In 2007, $2.0 million of contingent payments were earned and paid for the achievement of operating results. In 2006, $8.4 million and $21.9 million of contingent payments have been earned and paid, respectively, for research and development milestones; and no contingent payments have been earned or paid for operating results. During the years ended 2007 and 2006, $51.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, of contingent payments for operating results have expired. Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $143.2 million for 2007 and includes $285.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock. These cash outflows were offset by $138.4 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans and $5.4 million related to excess tax benefits related to share based payments. On June 20, 2005, we issued 3 1/4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 3 1/4% Notes) to certain qualified institutional investors at par value. Including the exercise of the over allotment option, the total size of the offering was $350.0 million. After expenses, the net proceeds we received were $343.0 million. Interest is payable on the Notes semi annually in arrears beginning December 15, 2005. In addition to the coupon interest of 3.25%, additional interest of 0.225% of the market value of the Notes may be required to be paid per six month period beginning June 15, 2011, if the market value of the 3 1/4% Notes during a specified period is 120% or more of the 3 1/4% Notes principal value. The 3 1/4% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Companys option on or after June 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the holders of the 3 1/4% Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 3 1/4% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on June 15, 2011, 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. Prepayment of amounts due under the 3 1/4% Notes will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the 3 1/4% Notes principal value upon default of payment of principal or interest when due for over thirty days, our default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of us to comply with any of its other agreements in the 3 1/4% Notes or indenture, or upon cross default by us or a significant subsidiary for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of our other debt or a significant subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50.0 million. The terms of the 3 1/4% Notes require us to settle the par value of such 3 1/4% Notes in cash and deliver shares only for the differential between the stock price on the date of conversion and the base conversion price (initially approximately $98.25 per share). On April 27, 2005, we entered into a secured line of credit that provides up to $250.0 million in borrowings at LIBOR plus 0.15%. On April 28, 2005 we borrowed $124.0 million to repurchase $125.0 million of its 2 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2006, for less than par value. A portion of the proceeds from the 3 1/4% Notes was used to pay down the secured line of credit. The secured credit facility was collateralized by investments and expired on September 30, 2005. 33 Table of Contents On February 19, 2004, we issued $450.0 million in principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 1 1/2% Notes) due 2024, to certain qualified institutional buyers. Interest on the Old 1 1/2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 15th and August 15th. In addition to the coupon interest of 1 1/2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the Old 1 1/2% Notes may be required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012, if the market value of the Old 1 1/2% Notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 1 1/2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 4.4 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $102.03 per share. The Old 1 1/2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after February 15, 2012, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 1 1/2% Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 1 1/2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on February 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022. We have $350.0 million in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 2% Notes) due August 1, 2023. Interest on the Old 2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 1st and August 1st. In addition to the coupon interest of 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the Old 2% Notes may be required to be paid beginning August 1, 2010, if the market value of the Old 2% Notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 5.1 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $68.24 per share. The Old 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after August 1, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 2% Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2013 and August 1, 2018. In December 2004, we offered up to $350.0 million in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the New 2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 83% of the Old 2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 2% Notes. In 2005, we completed the additional exchange of approximately $22.6 million of the Old 2% Notes with their holders for the New 2% Notes. In December 2004, we offered up to $450.0 million in principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the New 1 1/2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 1 1/2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 91% of the Old 1 1/2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 1 1/2% Notes. In 2005, we completed the additional exchange of approximately $1.0 million of the Old 1 1/2% Notes with their holders for the New 1 1/2% Notes. The New 2% Notes and New 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the New Notes) carry the same rights and attributes as the Old 2% Notes and Old 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the Old Notes) except for the following; the terms of the New Notes require us to settle the par value of such notes in cash and deliver shares only for the differential between the stock price on the date of conversion and the base conversion price (initially approximately $68.24 for New 2% Notes and $102.03 for the New 1 1/2% Notes). In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the 3 1/4% Notes, Old 1 1/2% Notes, Old 2% Notes, New 2% Notes and the 2 1/4% Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. In August 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, under this plan the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares, respectively, at a total cost of approximately $150.0 million. The cost of repurchased shares are included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in stockholders equity. As of December 31, 2007, management had completed stock repurchases up to this $500 million authorization. In July 2007, the Board approved a program authorizing management to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock over the next three years. Under this plan, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total cost of approximately $135.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The cost of repurchased shares are included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in stockholders equity. 34 Table of Contents We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery and Cell Systems platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million, short term investments of $60.7 million and long term investments of $0.7 million. Our working capital was $856.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and includes restricted cash and investments of $4.4 million. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, demand notes and municipal notes and bonds with maturities of less than three months. As of December 31, 2007, foreign subsidiaries in China, Japan and Norway had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $21.4 million, of which $0.9 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007. On January 9, 2006, the Company completed entering into a syndicated $250.0 million senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) with Bank of America, N.A. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are determined by reference to LIBOR or to an alternate base rate, with margins determined based on changes in the Companys leverage ratio. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company may request that the aggregate amount available be increased by $100.0 million of additional financing, subject to certain conditions having been met, including the availability of additional lender commitments. The Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants and conditions of default customary for financings of this type. The Company currently anticipates using the proceeds of the Credit Facility for the purpose of general working capital and capital expenditures and the Credit Facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding under it will be due and payable in full on January 6, 2011. As of December 31, 2007 the available credit is $243.3 million as the Company has issued $6.7 million in letters of credit through the facility. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the first quarter of 2009. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period(1) (in thousands) Total Less than1 Year Years2 3 Years4 5 More than 5Years All Other(2) Long term debt $ 1,566,612 $ 25,237 $ 50,950 $ 50,250 $ 1,440,175 Capital lease obligations 12 12 Operating lease obligations 125,475 19,354 28,154 20,705 57,262 Licensing and purchase obligations 115,944 33,244 46,578 32,076 4,096 FIN 48 liability and interest(2) 28,104 4,388 23,716 Other obligations 1,277 98 100 1,079 Total $ 1,837,424 $ 82,235 $ 125,780 $ 103,131 $ 1,502,612 $ 23,716 (1) Pursuant to one of our 2005 and 2007 acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on percentages of future gross sales of the acquired company through 2010. The purchase agreement does not limit the payment to a maximum amount. 35 Table of Contents (2) As of December 31, 2007, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits were $28.1 million. We were unable to reasonably estimate the timing of FIN 48 liability and interest payments in individual periods beyond twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title of the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $10.4 million at December 31, 2007. We recognize royalty revenue (including upfront licensing fees) when the amounts are earned and determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis, as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and or remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $39.9 million, $26.8 million and $23.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In our BioReliance business, we recognized revenue from commercial contracts, which were principally fixed price or fixed rate, using the proportional performance method, except for services that were generally completed within three days, which are accounted for using the completed contract method. Proportional performance was determined using expected output milestones. Revenue recorded under proportional performance for projects in process is designed to approximate the amount of revenue earned based on milestones reached within the scope of the contractual arrangement. We undertake a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects. We recognize revenue from government contracts, which are principally cost plus fixed fee, in amounts equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro rata portion of the earned fee. We provide for losses when they become known. Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers is recorded as revenue in the period the related product sales revenue is recognized. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified 36 Table of Contents to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year, with certain exceptions determined necessary by management. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the financial condition of that customer or in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $200.3 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.2 million at December 31, 2007. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. In our BioDiscovery segment, generally stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. In our CS segment, inventories are not as susceptible to obsolesce and we only provide reserves when the materials spoil or become dated. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Gross inventory totaled $218.7 million and the allowance for excess and obsolete and price impairment was $46.0 million at December 31, 2007. Valuation of goodwill. We are required to perform a review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. 37 Table of Contents In accordance with our policy, we completed our most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2007 and determined that no goodwill impairment existed. Our evaluation included management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review. Key assumptions from this strategic review included revenue growth, with higher net income growth. This growth was based on increased sales of new products as we expect to maintain our investment in research and development, the effect and growth from business acquisitions already consummated and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Additional value creators assumed included increased efficiencies in working capital as well as increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 9%. Operating mechanisms to ensure that these growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized were also proposed as part of the internal strategic review and considered in our evaluation. Our market capitalization at October 1, 2007 was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis. We cannot guarantee that when we complete our future annual or other periodic reviews for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $1.53 billion at December 31, 2007. Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets, which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2007, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $279.0 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $319.7 million. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities(SFAS 146) and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF 95 3). Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $11.2 million at December 31, 2007, the majority of which we expect to pay during 2008. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. 38 Table of Contents Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from current operations and certain former business operations of Dexter, which was acquired in 2000. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The product liability and warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves, which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $7.2 million at December 31, 2007. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns, actual non investment experience or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors, among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, reversing deferred tax liabilities, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our BioDiscovery and Cell Systems segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different 39 Table of Contents assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our shared assets to the individual segments. Share Based Compensation. Under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), we grant share based awards to eligible employees and directors to purchase shares of our common stock. In addition, we have a qualified employee stock purchase plan in which eligible employees may elect to withhold up to 15% of their compensation to purchase shares of our common stock on a quarterly basis at a discounted price equal to 85% of the lower of the employees offering price or the closing price of the stock on the date of purchase. The benefits provided by these plans qualify as share based compensation under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires us to recognize compensation expense based on their estimated fair values determined on the date of grant for all share based awards granted, modified or cancelled as of January 1, 2006 (the effective date). Prior to the effective date, we did not recognize any compensation cost in our income statements for share based awards granted with an option price equal to the fair market value of the our common stock on the date of grant or employee stock purchase rights as we accounted for them under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and its related interpretations and adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $35.5 million, $11.6 million and $1.1 million of compensation expense for employee stock options (including stock options assumed in business combinations) and purchase rights, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there was $43.7 million, $8.5 million and zero amount remaining in unrecognized compensation cost related to employee stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years for both employee stock options and restricted stock units. We estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing method (Black Scholes method), which was also used for the proforma information required to be disclosed under SFAS 123. The determination of fair value of share based awards using an option pricing model requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of share based compensation cost recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These include estimates of the expected term of share based awards, expected volatility of our stock price, expected dividends and the risk free interest rate. These estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and may result in materially different amounts should circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in our application of SFAS 123R in future periods. For share based awards issued during the year ended December 31, 2007, we estimated the expected term by considering various factors including the vesting period of options granted, employees historical exercise and post employment termination behavior and aggregation by homogeneous employee groups. Our estimated volatility was derived using a combination of our historical stock price volatility and the implied volatility of market traded options of our common stock with terms of up to approximately two years. Our decision to use a combination of historical and implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options of our common stock and our assessment that such a combination was more representative of future expected stock price trends. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, financial covenants, tax laws and other factors as the Board of Directors, in its discretion, deems relevant. The risk free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards. 40 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, were approximately $1,281.7 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2006 to our non U.S. revenues for 2007 would result in approximately $40.6 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $0.5 million, $(1.6) million and $49.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian kroner and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had $27.3 million and $11.9 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific 41 Table of Contents receivables and payables. The contracts as of December 31, 2007, which settle in January 2008, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. At December 31, the notional principal and fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivatives to hedge the value of its foreign currency receivables and payables were as follows: 2007 2006 (in millions) NotionalPrincipal FairValue NotionalPrincipal FairValue Forward exchange contracts $ 27.3 $ (0.07 ) $ 11.9 $ (0.07 ) The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end and does not represent the amount of our exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2007, we had $671.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $606.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. Additionally, changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of our short term investments of $60.7 million as they are comprised primarily of auction rate securities, with interest reset periods of less than three months. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would also not be expected to have a material impact on the remaining $4.5 million of our investments. While changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of research tools in reagent, kit and high throughput application forms to customers engaged in life sciences research, drug discovery, diagnostics and the commercial manufacture of biological products. Additionally we are a leading supplier of sera, cell and tissue culture media and reagents used in life sciences research, as well as in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and produce pharmaceuticals and other high valued proteins. We conduct our business through two principal segments: BioDiscovery. Our BioDiscovery segment includes molecular biology, cell biology and drug discovery product lines. Molecular biology encompasses products from the initial cloning and manipulation of DNA, to examining RNA levels and regulating gene expression in cells, to capturing, separating and analyzing proteins. These include the research tools used in reagent and kit form that simplify and improve gene acquisition, gene cloning, gene expression and gene analysis techniques. This segment also includes a full range of enzymes, nucleic acids, other biochemicals and reagents. These biologics are manufactured to the highest research standards and are matched in a gene specific, validated manner (gene, ORF, RNAi, protein, antibodies, etc.) to ensure researchers the highest purity and scientific relevance for their experimentation. We also offer software through this segment that enables more efficient, accelerated analysis and interpretation of genomic, proteomic and other biomolecular data for application in pharmaceutical, therapeutic and diagnostic development. The acquisitions of Zymed, Caltag, Dynal and Biosource have enhanced our ability to offer new technology and products, such as antibodies and proteins (Zymed, Caltag and BioSource) and magnetic beads used for biological separation (Dynal), which is the first step in almost every biologic investigative or diagnostic process. Cell Systems (CS). Our CS segment includes all of our GIBCO cell culture products and services. Products include sera, cell and tissue culture media, reagents used in both life sciences research and in processes to grow cells in the laboratory and to produce biopharmaceuticals and other end products made through cultured cells. CS services include the creation of commercially viable stable cell lines and the optimization of production processes used for the production of therapeutic drugs. The principal markets for our products include the life sciences research market and the biopharmaceutical production market. The life sciences research market consists of laboratories generally associated with universities, medical research centers, government institutions and other research institutions as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, energy, agricultural and chemical companies. Life sciences researchers use our reagents and informatics to perform a broad range of experiments in the laboratory. The biopharmaceutical production market consists of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that use sera and media for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of biopharmaceuticals. The selection of sera and media generally occurs early in the clinical process and continues through commercialization. Other industries consume sera and media for the commercial production of genetically engineered products including food processing and agricultural industries. Our Strategy Our objective is to provide essential life science technologies for disease research, drug discovery and commercial bio production. 24 Table of Contents Our strategies to achieve this objective include: New Product Innovation and Development Developing innovative new products. We place a great emphasis on internally developing new technologies for the life sciences research and biopharmaceutical production markets. Additionally, we are looking to leverage the broad range of our technologies to create unique synergistic technology solutions across our internal and newly acquired research and development centers of excellence. A significant portion of our growth and current revenue base has been created by the application of technology to accelerate the drug discovery process of our customers. We expect to focus new product development on three critical technology areas: Protein and antibody production, purification and characterization; Biochemical and cell based assays; and Labeling and detection,. In licensing technologies. We actively and selectively in license new technologies, which we modify to create high value kits, many of which address bottlenecks in the research or drug discovery laboratories. We have a dedicated group of individuals that is focused on in licensing technologies from academic and government institutions, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Acquisitions. We actively and selectively seek to acquire and integrate companies with complementary products and technologies, trusted brand names, strong market positions and strong intellectual property positions. We have acquired numerous companies since we became a public company in 1999. On April 1, 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Dynal Biotech Holding AS, a privately held corporation based in Oslo, Norway for cash of $402.6 million. Dynal is the industry leader in magnetic bead technologies that are used in cell separation and purification, cell stimulation, protein research, nucleic acid research and microbiology. The results of operations of Dynal are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the BioDiscovery segment from the date of acquisition. Additionally we have entered into other immaterial acquisitions which are further discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Divestitures. In April 2007, Invitrogen completed the sale of its BioReliance subsidiary to Avista Capital Partners and received net cash proceeds of approximately $209.0 million. No loss on the sale was recorded in 2007. The results of operations for BioReliance for the period from January through April 2007 and the results for all prior periods are reported as discontinued operations. The Company finalized the sale of BioSource Europe, S.A., a diagnostic business located in Belgium, in April of, 2007, to a private investor group in Belgium for proceeds of $5.5 million. Net proceeds from both acquisitions less cash spent as part of the disposal process were $209.9 million. Leverage Existing Sales, Distribution and Manufacturing Infrastructure Multi national sales footprint. We have developed a sales and distribution network with sales in approximately 70 countries throughout the world. Our sales force is highly trained, with many of our sales people possessing degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry or related fields. We believe our sales force has a proven track record for selling and distributing our products and we expect to leverage this capacity to increase sales of our existing, newly developed and acquired products. High degree of customer satisfaction. Our sales, marketing, customer service and technical support staff work well together to provide our customers exceptional service for our products and we have been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys. We use this strength to attract new customers and maintain existing customers. 25 Table of Contents Rapid product delivery. We have the ability to ship typical orders on a same day or next day basis. We use this ability to provide convenient service to our customers to generate additional sales. Our BioDiscovery and CS products are used for research purposes and their use by our customers generally is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or by any comparable international organization, with several limited exceptions. Some of our CS and antibody products and manufacturing sites are subject to FDA regulation and oversight and are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations described in 21 CFR part 820. Additionally, some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as ISO 9001 and ISO 13458. We conduct research activities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and New Zealand and business development activities around the world. As part of these activities we actively seek to license intellectual property from academic, government and commercial institutions. We manufacture the majority of our products in our manufacturing facilities located in Carlsbad and Camarillo, California; Eugene, Oregon; Frederick, Maryland; Grand Island, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Auckland, New Zealand; Oslo, Norway; and Paisley, Scotland. We also have manufacturing facilities in Japan and Israel. In addition, we purchase products from third party manufacturers for resale. Except for our oligonucleotide (custom primers), genomic services, biologics testing, specialized manufacturing and cell culture production businesses, which are make to order businesses, we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. We do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the future. In addition, we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials, product components and in some cases, entire products. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Each subsidiary records its income and expenses using the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary resides. To consolidate the income and expenses of all of our subsidiaries, we translate each subsidiarys results into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Changes in currency exchange rates have affected and will continue to affect our consolidated revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins and net income. In addition, many of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency, which can result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in these currencies are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction. We anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict. The timing and degree of fluctuation will depend upon several factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors Related to Our Operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions) 2007 2006 $ Increase/(Decrease) % Increase/(Decrease) BioDiscovery revenues $ 902.2 $ 814.7 $ 87.5 11 % Cell Systems revenues 379.5 336.5 43.0 13 % Total revenues $ 1,281.7 $ 1,151.2 $ 130.5 11 % BioDiscovery gross margin 70 % 68 % Cell Systems gross margin 50 % 52 % Total gross margin 56 % 53 % 26 Table of Contents Revenues Revenues increased $130.5 million or 11% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily a result of $59.7 million of increased volume and new product revenue, $40.6 million in foreign currency translation, and $29.8 million of price increases. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Norwegian kroner, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery revenues increased $87.5 million or 11% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily driven by $29.4 million in increased volume and new product revenue, $28.6 million in increased prices and a favorable impact of $28.9 million in foreign currency translation. Cell Systems (CS). CS revenues increased $43.0 million or 13% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily a result of increased volume and new product revenue of $30.3 million along with favorable impact of $11.7 million in foreign currency translation. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $107.6 million or 18% for 2007 compared to 2006. Gross profit for 2007 and 2006 included approximately $0.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of costs associated with the write up of acquired inventory to fair market value as a result of a business combination. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, this acquired inventory was written up to fair market value and subsequently expensed as the inventory was sold. Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $98.7 million for 2007 compared to $110.7 million for 2006. The $12.0 million decrease was mainly due to intangible assets acquired in prior periods being fully amortized during the year. The primary drivers for the increase in gross margin is related to $47.5 million in pricing and volume increases, $22.1 million in productivity increases and $26.4 million in favorable foreign currency impacts. We believe that gross margin for future periods will be affected by, among other things, the integration of acquired businesses in addition to sales volumes, competitive conditions, royalty payments on licensed technologies, the cost of raw materials, changes in average selling prices, our ability to make productivity improvements and foreign currency rates. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery gross margin increased 2% to 70% for 2007 compared to 68% in 2006 primarily due to lower operating costs, improved pricing and increased sales volume. Cell Systems (CS). CS gross margin decreased 2% to 50% for 2007 compared to 52% in 2006. Declines in gross margin were primarily the result of higher operating expenses and declines in sera pricing. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues OperatingExpense As aPercentageof SegmentRevenues $ Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) BioDiscovery Segment: Sales and marketing $ 185.1 21 % $ 172.8 21 % $ 12.3 7 % General and administrative 105.2 12 % 93.2 11 % 12.0 13 % Research and development 97.2 11 % 89.7 11 % 7.5 8 % Cell Systems Segment: Sales and marketing $ 60.9 16 % $ 54.5 16 % $ 6.4 12 % General and administrative 39.2 10 % 30.2 9 % 9.0 30 % Research and development 14.5 4 % 10.4 3 % 4.1 39 % Unallocated: Sales and marketing $ 6.0 $ 5.1 $ 0.9 General and administrative 19.7 26.7 (7.0 ) Research and development 4.1 4.2 (0.1 ) Consolidated: Sales and marketing $ 252.0 20 % $ 232.4 20 % $ 19.6 8 % General and administrative 164.1 13 % 150.1 13 % 14.0 9 % Research and development 115.8 9 % 104.3 9 % 11.5 11 % Sales and Marketing. For 2007, sales and marketing expenses increased $19.6 million or 8% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increased salaries and bonuses of $13.2 million, $4.5 million of additional purchased services expenses and $6.0 million of foreign currency translation impacts. This was partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses of $3.9 million as well as a decrease in supplies expenses of $1.4 million. General and Administrative. For 2007, general and administrative expenses increased $14.0 million or 9% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increases salaries and bonuses of $23.1 million, additional depreciation expense of $4.7 million which was driven by increased capital expenditures, $1.6 million in increases of travel expenses and $2.1 million of foreign currency translation impacts. This was partially offset by a decrease of $7.0 in stock based compensation expense, $5.8 million in purchased services expenses, $1.4 million in bad debt expenses and $4.3 million in other expenses. We continue to pursue programs and initiatives to improve our efficiency in the general and administrative area. These programs focus in the areas of process improvement and automation. We expect over time that these actions will result in a decline in our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Research and Development. Research and development expenses for 2007 increased $11.5 million or 11% compared to 2006. The increase resulted primarily from $5.4 million of salaries and bonus expenses, $1.4 million in increased purchase services expenses, $1.4 million in other expenses and $1.5 million in foreign currency translation expenses. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in supplies expense. Overall, gross research and development expenses increased 11 percent year over year as a result of our continued efforts to drive growth through new product development projects. We expect research and development expenses to remain at this level as a percentage of sales as we continue efforts to drive growth through new product development. Business Consolidation Costs. Business consolidation costs for 2007 were $5.6 million, compared to $12.5 million in 2006, and represent costs associated with our efforts to realign our business and consolidation of certain facilities. These costs consisted mainly of termination benefits of certain employees involuntarily terminated. We expect to continue to incur business consolidation costs in 2008 as we further consolidate operations and facilities. 28 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Interest Income. Interest income was $28.0 million in 2007 compared to $26.7 million in 2006. The $1.3 million increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average yield of our investments in 2007, partially offset by the effect of lower investment balances due to the payoff of the 2006 2 1/4% Convertible Notes and the share repurchase program. Interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in cash balances, which may materially increase or decrease as a result of acquisitions, stock repurchase programs and other financing activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $28.0 million for 2007 compared to $32.2 million for 2006. The primary reason for the $4.2 million reduction in interest expense was the maturity of the 2006 2 1/4% Convertible Notes in the prior year which were not part of the 2007 expense. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2007 and 2006 was comparable at $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of our pre tax income was 27.1% for 2007 compared with 27.2% of our pre tax income for 2006. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in income earned in jurisdictions having lower tax rates. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in millions) 2006 2005 $ Increase/(Decrease) % Increase/(Decrease) BioDiscovery revenues $ 814.7 $ 732.0 $ 82.7 11 % Cell Systems revenues 336.5 347.1 (10.6 ) (3 %) Total revenues $ 1,151.2 $ 1,079.1 $ 72.1 7 % BioDiscovery gross margin 68 % 70 % Cell Systems gross margin 52 % 50 % Total gross margin 53 % 51 % Revenues Revenues increased $72.1 million or 7% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily a result of $61.7 million of increased volume and acquisition related revenue, $28.0 million of price and royalty revenue increases and $2.4 million in foreign currency translation. The increases were partially offset by declines of $21.7 million due to sera products. Changes in the value of certain currencies, including the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the euro and the Norwegian kroner, can significantly increase or decrease our reported revenue on sales made in these currencies and could result in a material positive or negative impact on our reported results. In addition to currency exchange rates, we expect that future revenues will be affected by, among other things, new product introductions, competitive conditions, customer research budgets, government research funding, the rate of expansion of our customer base, price increases, product discontinuations and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or product lines. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery revenues increased $82.7 million or 11% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily driven by $56.9 million in increased volume and acquisition related revenue and $26.0 million in increased prices and higher royalty revenue. 29 Table of Contents Cell Systems (CS). CS revenues decreased $10.6 million or 3% for 2006 compared to 2005. The decline was primarily a result of $21.7 million of decreased volume and pricing within the sera business, partially offset by $6.9 million of pricing and volume increases in cell culture research. Sales of cell culture products for large scale production applications can vary significantly due to customer demand. In addition, cell culture revenues include sales of sera products whose price has historically been volatile. As a result, cell culture revenue growth rates can vary significantly. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $58.8 million or 11% for 2006 compared to 2005. Gross profit for 2006 and 2005 included approximately $4.4 million and $30.0 million, respectively, of costs associated with the write up of acquired inventory to fair market value as a result of a business combination. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, this acquired inventory was written up to fair market value and subsequently expensed as the inventory was sold. The impact of these inventory revaluations had a neutral impact on our overall gross profit when comparing 2006 to 2005. Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets acquired in our business combinations was $110.7 million for 2006 compared to $110.4 million for 2005. The $0.3 million increase was mainly due to intangible assets acquired through our acquisitions, partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized during 2006. BioDiscovery (BD). BioDiscovery gross margin decreased 2% to 68% for 2006 compared to 70% in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to lower margin products being sold in connection with acquired companies and collaborations and decreased manufacturing efficiencies. Cell Systems (CS). CS gross margin increased 2% to 52% for 2006 compared to 50% in 2005. Increased pricing in cell culture research was the primary driver for the increase in the margins.

For 2006, sales and marketing expenses increased $28.4 million or 14% compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from increased salaries and commissions of $13.8 million, $10.9 million of incremental expenses related to acquisitions, $5.1 million from share based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, foreign currency translation of $1.9 million and travel expenses of $3.4 million, partially offset by a $6.4 million reduction in incentive compensation. General and Administrative. For 2006, general and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million or 27% compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from $8.0 million of incremental expenses related to acquisitions, increased salaries and other expenses of $5.9 million and $26.6 million from share based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, partially offset by a $8.8 million reduction in incentive compensation. Research and Development. Research and development expenses for 2006 increased $6.5 million or 7% compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from $8.4 million of incremental expenses related to acquisitions, share based compensation due to the adoption of SFAS 123R of $3.8 million partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation of $4.7 million. Overall, research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was comparable to the prior year. Purchased In Process Research and Development Costs. In conjunction with our acquisitions in 2005, we purchased in process research and development projects valued at $17.0 million that were expensed upon their respective acquisition dates. There was no expense related to in process research and development in 2006. Business Consolidation Costs. Business consolidation costs for 2006 were $12.5 million and represent costs associated with our efforts to realign our business and consolidation of certain facilities. These costs consisted mainly of termination benefits of certain employees involuntarily terminated. Other Income (Expense) Interest Income. Interest income was $26.7 million in 2006 compared to $24.6 million in 2005. The $2.1 million increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average yield of our investments in 2006, partially offset by the effect of lower investment balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $32.2 million for 2006 compared to $34.0 million for 2005. The primary reason for the $1.8 million reduction in interest expense was open market repurchases of our 2 1/4% senior convertible notes, which reduced the average balance of our debt in 2006 compared to 2005. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, for 2006 and 2005, is composed of the following: For the Years EndedDecember 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Net periodic pension (expense) income(1) $ (0.7 ) $ 0.9 Gain (loss) on asset disposals 2.3 (0.1 ) Gain on forward contract(2) 21.0 Recognition of cumulative translation gains(3) 25.5 Gain on sale of an equity investment 2.8 Foreign currency gain on short term intercompany loan 2.2 Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains (1.6 ) 0.3 Other 0.5 4.9 Total other income, net $ 0.5 $ 57.5 (1) The net periodic pension income is from a defined benefit plan acquired in the merger with Dexter Corporation in 2000 and is recognized as other non operating income and expense since the plan provides benefits to participants who were not continuing employees of Invitrogen following the merger. 31 Table of Contents (2) The gain was recognized in March 2005 on the settlement of a forward contract related to the acquisition of Dynal. (3) Relates to the repatriation of $119.0 million of undistributed earnings from and substantial liquidation of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in the recognition of $25.5 million of cumulative translation gains. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of our pre tax income was 27.2% for 2006 compared with 23.9% of our pre tax income for 2005. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher primarily because tax expense in 2005 included the effect of a repatriation of foreign earnings that qualified for the reduced rate of tax as provided in The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). The tax incurred in 2005 included a benefit upon the repatriation of those foreign earnings that was lower than the tax liability recorded prior to the enactment of the AJCA. Discontinued Operations. In April 2007, we completed the sale of our BioReliance business unit, a component of the CS reporting unit, to Avista Capital Partners for approximately $210.0 million. In addition, in February 2007, we finalized the sale of BioSource Europe S.A., a diagnostic business in our BioDiscovery reporting unit. These operations were deemed to be discontinued operations and the results from these business divisions have been excluded from our continuing operations financial statements. Discontinued operations results for 2006 were a loss of $266.8 million compared to net income in the prior year of $10.6 million. The change year over year is primarily attributable to goodwill impairment of $270.4 million in 2006 as indicators determined the value of goodwill to be less than the carrying value. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities. Operating activities provided net cash of $323.6 million during 2007 primarily from our net income of $143.2 million plus net non cash charges of $179.4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net increase of $0.9 million in cash during the period. Within the non cash charges which provided cash, the primary drivers were amortization of intangible assets of $98.7 million, share based compensation of $42.5 million and depreciation charges of $37.4 million. The primary drivers of cash proceeds from changes in operating assets and liabilities were an increase in income taxes payable of $14.6 million, increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20.5 million which were partially offset by increases in inventories of $19.8 million and increases in prepaid and other assets of $11.4 million. As a result of working capital improvement programs, we expect to utilize our working capital more effectively in the future resulting in higher inventory turnover and lower days sales outstanding. Our working capital factors, such as inventory turnover and days sales outstanding, are seasonal and, on an interim basis during the year, may require an influx of short term working capital. Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities during 2007 was $48.5 million. The primary increase was related to cash proceeds from the sale of our BioReliance and BioSource Europe divisions which increased cash by $209.9 million. This increase in cash was offset by net purchases of securities of $51.8 million, purchases of property plant and equipment of $78.3 million and cash paid for business combinations of $31.3 million. For 2008, we expect spending for capital equipment and information technology to approximate 2007 spending. In 2007, we completed two acquisitions immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements. The net cash purchase price of acquisitions in 2007 was $31.2 million, of which $23.1 million related to acquisitions completed in 2007. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition and were not material to our consolidated financial results. See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents In late 2006, we completed an acquisition immaterial to our overall consolidated financial statements. The net cash purchase price of acquisitions in 2006 was $44.0 million, of which $15.1 million was related to the acquisition completed in 2006. The results of operations were included from the date of acquisition and were not material to our consolidated financial results. In April 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Dynal for a total cash purchase price of $347.3 million. We also paid cash to extinguish $53.1 million of debt following completion of the acquisition and transaction costs of $2.2 million and acquired cash of $1.1 million. The purchase price was paid from existing cash and investments. In 2005, we completed several other acquisitions that were not material to our overall consolidated financial statements. The aggregate cash purchase price of these acquisitions was $256.5 million and acquired cash totaling $18.1 million. The results of operations were included from the respective dates of acquisition. Pursuant to the purchase agreements for certain prior year and current year acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on the achievement of future gross sales of the acquired companies through 2010. The agreements do not limit the payment to a maximum amount. The Company will account for such contingent payments as an addition to the purchase price of the acquired company. Payments aggregating a maximum of $5.0 million based upon certain research and development milestones of the acquired companies could be required through 2008. In 2007, $2.0 million of contingent payments were earned and paid for the achievement of operating results. In 2006, $8.4 million and $21.9 million of contingent payments have been earned and paid, respectively, for research and development milestones; and no contingent payments have been earned or paid for operating results. During the years ended 2007 and 2006, $51.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, of contingent payments for operating results have expired. Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $143.2 million for 2007 and includes $285.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock. These cash outflows were offset by $138.4 million in proceeds from stock issued under employee stock plans and $5.4 million related to excess tax benefits related to share based payments. On June 20, 2005, we issued 3 1/4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 3 1/4% Notes) to certain qualified institutional investors at par value. Including the exercise of the over allotment option, the total size of the offering was $350.0 million. After expenses, the net proceeds we received were $343.0 million. Interest is payable on the Notes semi annually in arrears beginning December 15, 2005. In addition to the coupon interest of 3.25%, additional interest of 0.225% of the market value of the Notes may be required to be paid per six month period beginning June 15, 2011, if the market value of the 3 1/4% Notes during a specified period is 120% or more of the 3 1/4% Notes principal value. The 3 1/4% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Companys option on or after June 15, 2011, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the holders of the 3 1/4% Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 3 1/4% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, on June 15, 2011, 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. Prepayment of amounts due under the 3 1/4% Notes will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the 3 1/4% Notes principal value upon default of payment of principal or interest when due for over thirty days, our default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of us to comply with any of its other agreements in the 3 1/4% Notes or indenture, or upon cross default by us or a significant subsidiary for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of our other debt or a significant subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50.0 million. The terms of the 3 1/4% Notes require us to settle the par value of such 3 1/4% Notes in cash and deliver shares only for the differential between the stock price on the date of conversion and the base conversion price (initially approximately $98.25 per share). On April 27, 2005, we entered into a secured line of credit that provides up to $250.0 million in borrowings at LIBOR plus 0.15%. On April 28, 2005 we borrowed $124.0 million to repurchase $125.0 million of its 2 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2006, for less than par value. A portion of the proceeds from the 3 1/4% Notes was used to pay down the secured line of credit. The secured credit facility was collateralized by investments and expired on September 30, 2005. 33 Table of Contents On February 19, 2004, we issued $450.0 million in principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 1 1/2% Notes) due 2024, to certain qualified institutional buyers. Interest on the Old 1 1/2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 15th and August 15th. In addition to the coupon interest of 1 1/2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the Old 1 1/2% Notes may be required to be paid beginning February 15, 2012, if the market value of the Old 1 1/2% Notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 1 1/2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 4.4 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $102.03 per share. The Old 1 1/2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after February 15, 2012, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 1 1/2% Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 1 1/2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on February 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022. We have $350.0 million in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes (Old 2% Notes) due August 1, 2023. Interest on the Old 2% Notes is payable semi annually on February 1st and August 1st. In addition to the coupon interest of 2%, additional interest of 0.35% of the market value of the Old 2% Notes may be required to be paid beginning August 1, 2010, if the market value of the Old 2% Notes during specified testing periods is 120% or more of the principal value. The Old 2% Notes were issued at 100% of principal value and are convertible into 5.1 million shares of common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events at a price of $68.24 per share. The Old 2% Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option on or after August 1, 2010, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In addition, the holders of the Old 2% Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Old 2% Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, on August 1, 2010, August 1, 2013 and August 1, 2018. In December 2004, we offered up to $350.0 million in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the New 2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 83% of the Old 2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 2% Notes. In 2005, we completed the additional exchange of approximately $22.6 million of the Old 2% Notes with their holders for the New 2% Notes. In December 2004, we offered up to $450.0 million in principal amount of 1 1/2% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the New 1 1/2% Notes) in a non cash exchange for any and all outstanding Old 1 1/2% Notes, that were validly tendered on that date. Approximately 91% of the Old 1 1/2% Notes were exchanged by their holders for the New 1 1/2% Notes. In 2005, we completed the additional exchange of approximately $1.0 million of the Old 1 1/2% Notes with their holders for the New 1 1/2% Notes. The New 2% Notes and New 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the New Notes) carry the same rights and attributes as the Old 2% Notes and Old 1 1/2% Notes (collectively the Old Notes) except for the following; the terms of the New Notes require us to settle the par value of such notes in cash and deliver shares only for the differential between the stock price on the date of conversion and the base conversion price (initially approximately $68.24 for New 2% Notes and $102.03 for the New 1 1/2% Notes). In the event of a change of control of Invitrogen, the holders of the 3 1/4% Notes, Old 1 1/2% Notes, Old 2% Notes, New 2% Notes and the 2 1/4% Notes each have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest. In August 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, under this plan the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares, respectively, at a total cost of approximately $150.0 million. The cost of repurchased shares are included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in stockholders equity. As of December 31, 2007, management had completed stock repurchases up to this $500 million authorization. In July 2007, the Board approved a program authorizing management to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock over the next three years. Under this plan, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total cost of approximately $135.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The cost of repurchased shares are included in treasury stock and reported as a reduction in stockholders equity. 34 Table of Contents We are continuing to seek additional corporate and technology acquisition opportunities that support our BioDiscovery and Cell Systems platforms. While we cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions, or if any will occur at all, a significant amount of our cash and or stock may be used to acquire companies, assets or technologies. We could also choose to fund any acquisitions, at least partly, with new debt or stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million, short term investments of $60.7 million and long term investments of $0.7 million. Our working capital was $856.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and includes restricted cash and investments of $4.4 million. Our funds are currently invested in overnight money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, demand notes and municipal notes and bonds with maturities of less than three months. As of December 31, 2007, foreign subsidiaries in China, Japan and Norway had available bank lines of credit denominated in local currency to meet short term working capital requirements. The U.S. dollar equivalent of these facilities totaled $21.4 million, of which $0.9 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007. On January 9, 2006, the Company completed entering into a syndicated $250.0 million senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility) with Bank of America, N.A. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are determined by reference to LIBOR or to an alternate base rate, with margins determined based on changes in the Companys leverage ratio. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company may request that the aggregate amount available be increased by $100.0 million of additional financing, subject to certain conditions having been met, including the availability of additional lender commitments. The Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants and conditions of default customary for financings of this type. The Company currently anticipates using the proceeds of the Credit Facility for the purpose of general working capital and capital expenditures and the Credit Facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding under it will be due and payable in full on January 6, 2011. As of December 31, 2007 the available credit is $243.3 million as the Company has issued $6.7 million in letters of credit through the facility. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, funds from operations and interest income earned thereon will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the first quarter of 2009. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including future business acquisitions, future stock or note repurchases, scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs, our ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements, the cost involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due by Period(1) (in thousands) Total Less than1 Year Years2 3 Years4 5 More than 5Years All Other(2) Long term debt $ 1,566,612 $ 25,237 $ 50,950 $ 50,250 $ 1,440,175 Capital lease obligations 12 12 Operating lease obligations 125,475 19,354 28,154 20,705 57,262 Licensing and purchase obligations 115,944 33,244 46,578 32,076 4,096 FIN 48 liability and interest(2) 28,104 4,388 23,716 Other obligations 1,277 98 100 1,079 Total $ 1,837,424 $ 82,235 $ 125,780 $ 103,131 $ 1,502,612 $ 23,716 (1) Pursuant to one of our 2005 and 2007 acquisitions, we could be required to make additional contingent cash payments based on percentages of future gross sales of the acquired company through 2010. The purchase agreement does not limit the payment to a maximum amount. 35 Table of Contents (2) As of December 31, 2007, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits were $28.1 million. We were unable to reasonably estimate the timing of FIN 48 liability and interest payments in individual periods beyond twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenue from the sale of our products, services and technology. We recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title of the product, which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer. We generally ship to our customers FOB shipping point. If our shipping policies, including the point of title transfer, were to change, materially different reported results would be likely. In cases where customers order and pay for products and request that we store a portion of their order for them at our cost, we record any material up front payments as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer. Deferred revenue totaled $10.4 million at December 31, 2007. We recognize royalty revenue (including upfront licensing fees) when the amounts are earned and determinable, which is generally when we receive the cash payment. We are able to recognize minimum required payments on an accrual basis, as they are determinable under contract. However, since we are not able to forecast product sales by licensees, royalty payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of the royalties due and or remitted their cash payment to us. Should information on licensee product sales become available so as to enable us to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual basis, materially different revenues and results of operations could occur. Royalty revenue totaled $39.9 million, $26.8 million and $23.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In our BioReliance business, we recognized revenue from commercial contracts, which were principally fixed price or fixed rate, using the proportional performance method, except for services that were generally completed within three days, which are accounted for using the completed contract method. Proportional performance was determined using expected output milestones. Revenue recorded under proportional performance for projects in process is designed to approximate the amount of revenue earned based on milestones reached within the scope of the contractual arrangement. We undertake a review of unbilled accounts receivable from customers to determine that such amounts are expected to become billable and collectible in all material respects. We recognize revenue from government contracts, which are principally cost plus fixed fee, in amounts equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro rata portion of the earned fee. We provide for losses when they become known. Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers is recorded as revenue in the period the related product sales revenue is recognized. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing, known circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Specifically, management must make estimates in the following areas: Allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay. We determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers country or industry, historical losses and our customers credit worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified 36 Table of Contents to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility, customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly. Should a customers account become past due, we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. Additionally, our policy is to fully reserve for all accounts with aged balances greater than one year, with certain exceptions determined necessary by management. The likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the financial condition of that customer or in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment. Reserves are fully provided for all expected or probable losses of this nature. Gross trade accounts receivables totaled $200.3 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.2 million at December 31, 2007. Inventory adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. We review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. In our BioDiscovery segment, generally stock levels in excess of one years expectation of usage or sales are fully reserved. In our CS segment, inventories are not as susceptible to obsolesce and we only provide reserves when the materials spoil or become dated. The likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on customer demand, competitive conditions or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations. Gross inventory totaled $218.7 million and the allowance for excess and obsolete and price impairment was $46.0 million at December 31, 2007. Valuation of goodwill. We are required to perform a review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. In addition to the annual review, an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; a loss of key personnel; a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; the testing for recoverability under Statement 144 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. Assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Additionally, since our reporting units share the majority of our assets, we must make assumptions and estimates in allocating the carrying value as well as the fair value of net assets to each reporting unit. 37 Table of Contents In accordance with our policy, we completed our most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2007 and determined that no goodwill impairment existed. Our evaluation included management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review. Key assumptions from this strategic review included revenue growth, with higher net income growth. This growth was based on increased sales of new products as we expect to maintain our investment in research and development, the effect and growth from business acquisitions already consummated and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Additional value creators assumed included increased efficiencies in working capital as well as increased efficiencies from capital spending. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 9%. Operating mechanisms to ensure that these growth and efficiency assumptions will ultimately be realized were also proposed as part of the internal strategic review and considered in our evaluation. Our market capitalization at October 1, 2007 was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis. We cannot guarantee that when we complete our future annual or other periodic reviews for impairment of goodwill that a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Goodwill totaled $1.53 billion at December 31, 2007. Valuation of intangible and other long lived assets. We periodically assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets, which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets. The assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances: the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the asset; significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. We also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. At December 31, 2007, the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled $279.0 million, the net book value of unamortized identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $7.5 million and the net book value of property, plant and equipment totaled $319.7 million. Accrued merger and restructuring related costs. To the extent that exact amounts are not determinable, we have estimated amounts for direct costs of our acquisitions, merger related expenses and liabilities related to our business combinations and restructurings in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities(SFAS 146) and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF 95 3). Our accrued merger and restructuring related costs were $11.2 million at December 31, 2007, the majority of which we expect to pay during 2008. Materially different reported results would be likely if any of the estimated costs or expenses were different from our estimations or if the approach, timing and extent of the restructuring plans adopted by management were different. 38 Table of Contents Litigation reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation is uncertain. As such, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves. We maintain self insurance reserves to cover potential property, casualty and workers compensation exposures from current operations and certain former business operations of Dexter, which was acquired in 2000. These reserves are based on actuarially determined loss probabilities and take into account loss history as well as actuarial projections based on industry statistics. We also maintain environmental reserves to cover estimated costs for certain environmental exposures assumed in the merger with Dexter. The environmental reserves, which are not discounted, are determined by management based upon currently available information. Divestiture reserves are maintained for known claims and warranties assumed in the merger with Dexter. The product liability and warranty reserves are based on management estimates that consider historical claims. As actual losses and claims become known to us, we may need to make a material change in our estimated reserves, which could also materially impact our results of operations. Our insurance, environmental and divestiture reserves totaled $7.2 million at December 31, 2007. Benefit and pension plans. We sponsor and manage several retirement and health plans for employees and former employees. Accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and rates of compensation increase that are used by our actuaries to determine our liabilities and annual expenses for these plans in addition to the value of the plan assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our actuaries also rely on assumptions, such as mortality rates, in preparing their estimates for us. The likelihood of materially different valuations for assets, liabilities or expenses, would depend on interest rates, investment returns, actual non investment experience or actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations. Income taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits in the period in which such determination is made. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors, among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, reversing deferred tax liabilities, changes in the deductibility of interest paid on our convertible subordinated debt and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations. Segment Information. We provide segment financial information and results for our BioDiscovery and Cell Systems segments based on the segregation of revenues and expenses used for managements assessment of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different 39 Table of Contents assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment. Also, we do not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of our total assets are shared or non segment assets which we do not assign to our two operating segments. We have determined that it is not useful to assign our shared assets to the individual segments. Share Based Compensation. Under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), we grant share based awards to eligible employees and directors to purchase shares of our common stock. In addition, we have a qualified employee stock purchase plan in which eligible employees may elect to withhold up to 15% of their compensation to purchase shares of our common stock on a quarterly basis at a discounted price equal to 85% of the lower of the employees offering price or the closing price of the stock on the date of purchase. The benefits provided by these plans qualify as share based compensation under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires us to recognize compensation expense based on their estimated fair values determined on the date of grant for all share based awards granted, modified or cancelled as of January 1, 2006 (the effective date). Prior to the effective date, we did not recognize any compensation cost in our income statements for share based awards granted with an option price equal to the fair market value of the our common stock on the date of grant or employee stock purchase rights as we accounted for them under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and its related interpretations and adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $35.5 million, $11.6 million and $1.1 million of compensation expense for employee stock options (including stock options assumed in business combinations) and purchase rights, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there was $43.7 million, $8.5 million and zero amount remaining in unrecognized compensation cost related to employee stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years for both employee stock options and restricted stock units. We estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing method (Black Scholes method), which was also used for the proforma information required to be disclosed under SFAS 123. The determination of fair value of share based awards using an option pricing model requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of share based compensation cost recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These include estimates of the expected term of share based awards, expected volatility of our stock price, expected dividends and the risk free interest rate. These estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and may result in materially different amounts should circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in our application of SFAS 123R in future periods. For share based awards issued during the year ended December 31, 2007, we estimated the expected term by considering various factors including the vesting period of options granted, employees historical exercise and post employment termination behavior and aggregation by homogeneous employee groups. Our estimated volatility was derived using a combination of our historical stock price volatility and the implied volatility of market traded options of our common stock with terms of up to approximately two years. Our decision to use a combination of historical and implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options of our common stock and our assessment that such a combination was more representative of future expected stock price trends. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, financial covenants, tax laws and other factors as the Board of Directors, in its discretion, deems relevant. The risk free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards. 40 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION We translate the financial statements of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars for consolidation using end of period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Net gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements, the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany receivables and payables of a long term investment nature and net exchange rate gains and losses on the value of financial contracts entered into that hedge the value of these long term intercompany receivables and payables are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. These adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying non U.S. investment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our reported results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Based on the foreign currency rate in effect at the time of the translation of our non U.S. results of operations into U.S. dollars, reported results could be different from prior periods even if the same amount and mix of our products were sold at the same local prices during the two periods. This will affect our reported results of operations and also makes the comparison of our business performance in two periods more difficult. For example, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, were approximately $1,281.7 million using applicable foreign currency exchange rates for that period. However, applying the foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2006 to our non U.S. revenues for 2007 would result in approximately $40.6 million less revenue for that period. These changes in currency exchange rates have affected and will continue to affect, our reported results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our results. Foreign Currency Transactions. We have operations in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. These transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency. The value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables are included in the determination of net income. Net currency exchange gains (losses) recognized on business transactions, net of hedging transactions, were $0.5 million, $(1.6) million and $49.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our currency exposures vary, but are primarily concentrated in the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian kroner and Japanese yen. Historically, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency receivables and payables. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had $27.3 million and $11.9 million in foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge currency risk on specific 41 Table of Contents receivables and payables. The contracts as of December 31, 2007, which settle in January 2008, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific receivables and payables will be settled in, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying receivables and payables. At December 31, the notional principal and fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivatives to hedge the value of its foreign currency receivables and payables were as follows: 2007 2006 (in millions) NotionalPrincipal FairValue NotionalPrincipal FairValue Forward exchange contracts $ 27.3 $ (0.07 ) $ 11.9 $ (0.07 ) The notional principal amounts provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end and does not represent the amount of our exposure to market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Commodity Prices. Our exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize certain commodities as raw materials. We manage our exposure to changes in those prices primarily through our procurement and sales practices. Interest Rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2007, we had $671.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, all of which are stated at fair value. Changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of $606.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007, as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months. Additionally, changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of our short term investments of $60.7 million as they are comprised primarily of auction rate securities, with interest reset periods of less than three months. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would also not be expected to have a material impact on the remaining $4.5 million of our investments. While changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment.
