Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to inventory valuation and revenue recognition. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. In addition to writedowns based on newly introduced parts, statistical and judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence. 13 Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title, which generally occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue from the Companys sales to domestic distributors is recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. As a result, the Company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise. The Company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms. The income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as "Deferred income on shipments to distributors" until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company estimates international distributor returns based on historical data and current business expectations and defers a portion of international distributor sales and profits based on these estimated returns. Such amounts are classified in "Deferred income on shipments to distributors" on the accompanying balance sheet. Results of Operations The table below states the income statement items as a percentage of net sales and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change June 29, June 30, July 1, 2003 Over 2002 Over 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 18% (47%) Cost of sales 25.6 28.2 23.8 7 (37) Gross profit 74.4 71.8 76.2 23 (50) Expenses: Research & development 15.1 15.6 10.5 14 (22) Selling, general & administrative 10.8 12.2 9.5 5 (32) 25.9 27.8 20.0 10 (27) Operating income 48.5 44.0 56.2 31 (59) Interest income net 6.4 10.3 6.6 (27) (17) Income before income taxes 54.9% 54.3% 62.8% 20 (54) Effective tax rates 29.0% 29.0% 30.0% Net sales for the year ended June 29, 2003 were $606.6 million, an increase of $94.3 million or 18% over net sales of $512.3 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price. The decrease in average selling price is the result of a continuing change in mix to smaller package products and due to slight price reductions when compared to the previous fiscal year. Geographically, international sales represented 68% of net sales, 4% higher than fiscal 2002. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented 34% of net sales, while sales to Europe and Japan were 18% and 16% of net sales, respectively. Domestic sales were approximately 32% of net sales for fiscal 2003 compared to 36% for fiscal 2002. Sales increased year over year by 63% in Japan, 25% in the ROW, 9% in Europe and 4% in the United States. The Companys major end markets are communications, industrial and computer. Sales rose in all major end markets led by communications. Net sales for the year ended June 30, 2002 were $512.3 million, a decrease of $460.3 million or 47% from net sales of $972.6 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments, and marginally due to a decrease in the average selling price. Geographically, international sales represented 64% of net sales, 10% higher than fiscal 2001. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented 32% of net sales, while sales to Europe and Japan were 20% and 12% of net sales, respectively. Sales decreased 58% year over year in the United States, decreased by 56% in Japan, decreased by 14 49% in Europe, and decreased 13% in ROW. The Companys major end markets are communications, industrial and computer. Sales fell in all major end markets led by communications. To partially offset the impact of reduced sales on net profits during fiscal 2003 and 2002 the Company reduced its variable expenses primarily in the area of compensation. The Company achieved this by reducing profit sharing and by having plant shutdowns during fiscal 2003 and 2002. During fiscal 2003 the entire Company had five fewer one week shutdowns when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, during fiscal 2003 the Company raised the profit sharing payout when compared to fiscal 2002, which was reduced substantially from fiscal 2001. Due to having fewer shutdowns during the year and increased profit sharing the Company had greater compensation costs throughout the cost of sales and operating expense lines when compared to the previous fiscal year. Gross profit for the year ended June 29, 2003 was $451.5 million, an increase of $83.9 million or 23% over gross profit of $367.6 million in fiscal 2002. Gross profit was 74.4% of net sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to 71.8% in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across a higher sales base. This effect was partially offset by the reduction in shutdowns referred to above and increased profit sharing. The decrease in average selling price referred to above did not have a commensurate effect on gross margin since most of the reduction was due to a change in product mix as the Company has had increased sales of products with smaller die and package types, which have a lower average selling price but also lower costs. Gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2002 was $367.6 million, a decrease of $373.9 million or 50% from gross profit of $741.5 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2001. Gross profit was 71.8% of net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to 76.2% in fiscal 2001. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to the unfavorable effect of fixed costs allocated across a lower sales base. This effect was partially offset by the reduction in compensation costs and secondarily to the closure of the Companys 4 inch wafer fabrication plant. Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $91.4 million, $79.8 million and $102.5 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, or 15.1%, 15.6% and 10.5% of net sales, respectively. The dollar increase in R&D expenses in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due to increases in compensation costs caused by fewer plant shutdowns referred to above, higher profit sharing and increased headcount. These increases were offset by lower mask costs. The decrease in R&D expenses in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was due to lower profit sharing and the Company shutdowns; this effect was somewhat offset by increases in staffing levels for design engineers. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $65.6 million, $62.6 million and $92.7 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, or 10.8%, 12.2% and 9.5% of net sales, respectively. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was due to increases in compensation costs caused by higher profit sharing and by fewer plant shutdowns while headcount remained relatively unchanged. These increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses. The dollar decrease in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2001 was due to lower compensation costs caused by lower profit sharing and by plant shutdowns of one week per month for the first three quarters in fiscal 2002. Interest income decreased 27% in fiscal 2003 to $38.7 million and decreased 17% in fiscal 2002 to $53.3 million from $64.4 million in fiscal 2001. The Companys cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance increased $41.5 million during fiscal 2003 after spending $230.0 million on repurchasing 8.4 million shares of the Companys common stock. Interest income fell in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 due to the decline in average interest rates earned on the Companys cash investments which was partially offset by the interest earned on the $41.5 million increase in cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance. Also contributing to the decline in interest income was the addition of interest expense in fiscal 2003 relating to a royalty agreement. Interest expense is netted against interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2002 as compared to 2001 was due to the decline in average interest rates earned on the Companys cash equivalent and short term investment balance which was partially offset by the interest earned on the $3.0 million dollar increase in the Companys cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance. The Companys effective tax rate was 29%, 29%, and 30% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The lower tax rates in fiscal 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to increased business activity in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and an increase in tax exempt interest income as a percentage of total interest income. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of the five fiscal years beginning July 1, 1996 and ending July 1, 2001 with 15 the exception of the foreign sales corporation (FSC) benefits. As a result of the completed portion of the examination, earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were adjusted with the primary effect being an increase in domestic taxes paid and a decrease in the deferred tax liability account. The IRS results are included in fiscal 2003 financial statements and did not have a material impact upon them. Although the outcome of the tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that an adequate amount of taxes and related interest and penalty, if any, have been provided for any additional adjustment that may result from these years. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in "Risks and Competition" located in the "Business" section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2003 was better than the previous fiscal year, as the Company reported solid growth over the previous fiscal year. Although the Company has seen improvements across all of its major end markets during fiscal 2003, its backlog of $57.2 million as compared to $46.1 million at the end of the previous fiscal year, while improving within fiscal 2003, is still low by historic standards. Overall demand for the Companys products is improving; however, the Companys customers continue to be cautious in their ordering patterns. The conditions external to the Company remain largely unchanged, as general global economic and political conditions remain causes for concern. Consequently, although confidently and accurately forecasting short term results is difficult, when weighing all factors, including improving bookings, good positioning in diverse applications across many end markets, responsive lead times and good inventory mix positioning, and partially offsetting these positive factors with customer conservatism in response to sluggish economic news and geo political concerns, and some summer seasonal slowness, the Company expects low single digit growth in sales and profits in the September quarter, which is in line with the Companys normal summer quarter patterns. Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance of the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits brought against the Company are critical factors influencing future sales growth and sustained profitability. The Companys headquarters and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Consequently, the Company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by the above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At June 29, 2003, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.6 billion and working capital was also $1.6 billion. During fiscal 2003 the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its common stock for $230.0 million. After taking into consideration the cash used for these purchases, the Company generated additional cash and short term investments of $41.5 million. During fiscal 2003, the Company generated $284.2 million of cash from operating activities. Additionally, the Company generated $48.4 million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. During fiscal 2003, significant cash expenditures included net purchases of short term investments of $105.7 million and $6.6 million for the purchase of capital assets. The Company also paid $230.0 million to repurchase 8.4 million 16 shares of its common stock. The Company paid $65.8 million in cash dividends to stockholders representing $0.21 per share per year compared to $0.17 per share in fiscal 2002. In April 2003, the Companys Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.06 per share. The payment of future dividends will be based on quarterly financial performance. As of June 29, 2003, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements or activities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at June 29, 2003, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $13.6 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains being included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. The Company generally holds securities until maturity and carries the securities at fair market value. The Company has no debt and has historically satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and the initial placement of equity securities. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future. 17
