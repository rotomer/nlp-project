ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to inventory valuation and revenue recognition. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. In addition to writedowns based on newly introduced parts, statistical and judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title, which generally occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue from the Companys sales to domestic distributors is recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. As a result, the Company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise. The Company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms. The income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as "Deferred income on shipments to distributors" until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company estimates international distributor returns based on historical data and current business expectations and defers a portion of international distributor sales and profits based on these estimated returns. Such amounts are classified in "Deferred income on shipments to distributors" on the accompanying balance sheet. 15 Results of Operations The table below states the income statement items as a percentage of net sales and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change June 27, June 29, June 30, 2004 Over 2003 Over 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 33% 18% Cost of sales 23.0 25.6 28.2 20 7 Gross profit 77.0 74.4 71.8 38 23 Expenses: Research & development 13.0 15.1 15.6 14 14 Selling, general & administrative 9.9 10.8 12.2 22 5 22.9 25.9 27.8 18 10 Operating income 54.1 48.5 44.0 48 31 Interest income, net 3.2 6.4 10.3 (34) (27) Income before income taxes 57.3% 54.9% 54.3% 39 20 Effective tax rates 29.0% 29.0% 29.0% Net sales for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004 were $807.3 million, an increase of $200.7 million or 33% over net sales of $606.6 million for the same period of the previous fiscal year. The increase in net sales for the twelve month period was due to a significant increase in unit volume as demand increased for the Companys products in each of its major end markets, particularly in the industrial and communication markets. This increase in unit volume was enhanced by significant growth in sales of smaller packaged products that go into a wide variety of hand held products such as cellular phones and MP3 players. The significant increase in unit volume was offset partially by a reduction in average selling price, which decreased to $1.40 in fiscal 2004 from $1.57 in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of the change in sales mix towards smaller packages which carry lower average selling prices. Geographically, international sales were $569.7 million or 71% of net sales for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004, an increase of $156.3 million as compared to international sales of $413.4 million or 68% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2003. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World ("ROW"), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $309.1 million or 38% of net sales, while sales to Europe and Japan were $140.4 million or 18% of net sales and $120.2 million or 15% of net sales, respectively. Domestic sales were $237.6 million or 29% of net sales for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004, an increase of $44.4 million as compared to domestic sales of $193.2 million or 32% of net sales in the same period in fiscal 2003. Sales increased in absolute dollars both internationally and domestically, however the decline in domestic sales as a percentage of net sales and the respective increase in international sales as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from the Companys domestic customers shifting more of their manufacturing operations overseas. Net sales for the year ended June 29, 2003 were $606.6 million, an increase of $94.3 million or 18% over net sales of $512.3 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price primarily due to a change in sales mix to smaller packaged products. The average selling price fell from $1.85 per unit in fiscal 2002 to $1.57 per unit in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003 international sales represented $413.4 or 68% of net sales, an increase of $87.2 million as compared to international sales of $326.2 million or 64% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003 sales to ROW represented $203.5 million or 34% of net sales, while sales to Europe and Japan were $111.1 million or 18% of net sales and $98.8 million or 16% of net sales, respectively. Domestic sales were $193.2 million or 32% of net sales for the twelve months ended June 29, 2003 compared to $186.1 million or 36% of net sales in the same period in fiscal 2002. Gross profit for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $621.3 million, an increase of $169.8 million or 38% over gross profit of $451.5 million in fiscal 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 77% of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to 74.4% of net sales in fiscal 2003. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across higher net sales. Net sales increased 33% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in average selling price referred to 16 above did not have a commensurate effect on gross margin. Most of the reduction in average selling price was due to a change in product mix as the Company has had increased sales of products with smaller die and package types, which have a smaller average selling price, but also lower costs. Gross profit for the year ended June 29, 2003 was $451.5 million, an increase of $83.9 million or 23% over gross profit of $367.6 million in fiscal 2002. Gross profit was 74.4% of net sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to 71.8% in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across higher net sales. Net sales increased 18% in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002. This effect was offset by increases to the employee profit sharing accrual and fewer weekly plant shutdowns in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002. Research and development ("R&D") expense for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $104.6 million, an increase of $13.2 million or 14% over R&D expense of $91.4 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in R&D was primarily due to a $10.6 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs increased as the result of increases to the profit sharing accrual, employee headcount, annual merit increases, and the related fringe on these increases. Since the Company had better operating results, R&D profit sharing grew $5.5 million while compensation related to headcount, annual merit increases and the related fringe on these increases together totaled $5.1 million. In addition, the Company had a $2.6 million increase in non compensation costs, primarily software maintenance amortization, supplies and depreciation. R&D expense for the year ended June 29, 2003 was $91.4 million, an increase of $11.6 million or 14% over R&D expense of $79.8 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in R&D in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due to increases in compensation costs caused by higher profit sharing, increased headcount, merit increases and fewer weekly plant shutdowns. Since the Company had better operating results in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002, R&D profit sharing grew $2.1 million while compensation related to headcount, fewer weekly plant shutdowns, annual merit increases and the related fringe on these increases together totaled $6.7 million. In addition, the Company had a $2.8 million increase in non compensation costs, primarily software maintenance amortization and depreciation. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $80.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million or 22% over SG&A expense of $65.6 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in SG&A was due to a $10.5 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs grew as the result of increases to the profit sharing accrual, employee headcount, annual merit increases and commissions. Since the Company had better operating results, SG&A profit sharing grew $4.0 million while compensation related to headcount, annual merit increases and commissions together totaled $6.5 million. In addition to compensation costs, the Company had a $3.9 million increase in SG&A related expenses for advertising, outside services and travel costs. SG&A expense for the year ended June 29, 2003 was $65.6 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 5% over SG&A expense of $62.6 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in SG&A in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due to increases in compensation costs caused by higher profit sharing, increased headcount, merit increases and fewer weekly plant shutdowns. Since the Company had better operating results in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002, SG&A profit sharing grew $1.5 million while compensation related to headcount, fewer weekly plant shutdowns, annual merit increases and the related fringe on these increases together totaled $3.0 million. The increases in compensation costs were offset by a $1.5 million decrease in outside service costs and legal expenses. Interest income, net decreased 34% in fiscal 2004 to $25.5 million from $38.7 million in fiscal 2003. Interest income, net decreased in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 due to the decline in average interest rates earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance which was partially offset by the interest earned on the $63.0 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balance. Also contributing to the decline in interest income, net was the increase in interest expense on the Companys long term royalty agreement. Interest expense for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $2.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million over interest expense of $0.5 million in fiscal 2003. Interest income, net decreased 27% in fiscal 2003 to $38.7 million from $53.3 million in fiscal 2002. Interest income, net decreased in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 due to the decline in average interest rates earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance which was partially offset by the interest earned on the $41.5 million increase in cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance. Also contributing to the 17 decline in interest income, net was the addition of interest expense in fiscal 2003 relating to the Companys long term royalty agreement. The Companys effective tax rate was 29%, in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. The tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to business activity in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates, tax exempt interest income and the tax credits received by the Company for qualified R&D expenditures. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the Singapore government agreed to extend the Companys tax holiday for seven years, through August 2011 provided that the Company fulfills certain investment requirements in qualifying activities. The tax holiday may be extended through August 2014 provided that the Company fulfills additional investment requirements in qualifying activities. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in "Risks and Competition" located in the "Business" section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company experienced strong yearly growth in fiscal 2004 by growing sales and profits 33% and 39% respectively. The Company grew sales in each geographic market area and in each of its end markets: industrial communication, computer, automotive, high end consumer and space level/military. The Semiconductor Industry Assn. (SIA) forecasts are projecting robust growth for 2004 through 2007 with analog growing from $26.8 billion at the start of 2004 to $42.7 billion at the end of 2007. In light of the business outlook and the Companys anticipated growth, the Company is developing its leasehold property located in Singapore adjacent to its existing facility. The new building will be used primarily to increase its capacity for test and distribution operations. The Company anticipates that the building will be completed by the end of fiscal 2005. In addition to this expansion, the Company is also adding to wafer fabrication capacity in both Camas and Hillview. The Company continues to have a positive book to bill ratio, backlog of $151.2 million at June 27, 2004 is up significantly from last years backlog of $57.2 million. The Companys inventory is well positioned and the Company continues to have responsive lead times. Consequently, should these positive trends continue, the Company expects to have a seasonally strong start to the new fiscal year with sales growing roughly 5% 7% sequentially in the September fiscal 2005 quarter from the June quarter just completed. The Company anticipates that the effective tax rate will increase from 29% to 31% in the first part of fiscal 2005 as a result of the expiration of the tax credit legislation for R&D expenses on June 30, 2004. Although its not assured, the Company expects that Congress may extend the tax credit legislation. Until such time however, the Company expects that its effective tax rate will increase by 2 percentage points to 31% until the R&D credit is extended. If the R&D credit is extended without interruption, the effective tax rate will return to a 29% annual rate for fiscal 2005. Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance of the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the Company, are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability. The Companys headquarters and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California, consequently, the Company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of 18 high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At June 27, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.7 billion and working capital was $1.6 billion. During fiscal 2004 the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its common stock for $331.9 million and distributed $87.5 million in dividends. After taking into consideration the cash used for these purchases and dividend payments the Company generated additional cash and short term investments of $63.0 million. During fiscal 2004, the Company generated $457.8 million of cash from operating activities and $60.6 million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans. During fiscal 2004, significant cash expenditures included repurchasing $331.9 million of common stock, payments of $87.5 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $0.06 per share per quarter for the first and second quarters and $0.08 per share per quarter for the third and fourth quarters, $20.7 million for the purchase of capital assets and net purchases of short term investments of $11.0 million. In July, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share to be paid during the September quarter of fiscal 2005. The payment of future dividends will be based on quarterly financial performance. During fiscal 2005 the Company anticipates roughly $75.0 million in capital expenditures that will be used primarily to expand its wafer fabrication facilities and its test and distribution operation noted above. The Company has no debt and has historically satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and the initial placement of equity securities. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future. As of June 27, 2004, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements or activities outside of operating leases as disclosed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on this Annual Report on Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at June 27, 2004, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $10.2 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains being included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. The Company generally holds securities until maturity. The Companys sales outside the United States are transacted in U.S. dollars; accordingly the Companys sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. To date, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on the results of operations. 19
