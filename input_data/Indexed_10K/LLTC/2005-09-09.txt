ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to inventory valuation, revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. The Company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand. The Company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to the reserve based on the current business climate. In addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts, judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability, obsolescence, historical experience and current business conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title, which generally occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue from the Companys sales to domestic distributors is generally recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. As a result, the Company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise. The Company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms. The income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as "Deferred income on shipments to distributors" until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company has reserves to cover expected product returns. If product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations, the Company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns. Generally, changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin. Income Taxes The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, such as the tax benefit for export sales, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period. 15 The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If the Company determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, it will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary. On the other hand, the Company will record an additional charge to its provision for taxes in the period in which it determines that the recorded tax liability is less than it expects the ultimate assessment to be. For a discussion of current tax matters, see "Note 5. Income Taxes" and "Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Results of Operations The table below states the income statement items as a percentage of net revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change July 3, June 27, June 29, 2005 Over 2004 Over 2005 2004 2003 2004 2003 Net revenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 30% 33% Cost of sales 20.9 23.0 25.6 18 20 Gross profit 79.1 77.0 74.4 34 38 Expenses: Research & development 12.5 13.0 15.1 26 14 Selling, general & administrative 10.4 9.9 10.8 37 22 22.9 22.9 25.9 30 18 Operating income 56.2 54.1 48.5 35 48 Interest income, net 2.9 3.2 6.4 19 (34) Income before income taxes 59.1% 57.3% 54.9% 34 39 Effective tax rates 30.0% 29.0% 29.0% Net revenues for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005 were $1,049.7 million, an increase of $242.4 million or 30% over net revenues of $807.3 million for the same period of the previous fiscal year. The $242.4 million increase in net revenues is primarily due to a $202.4 million increase in product sales, largely due to an increase in unit volume for the twelve month period. Demand increased for the Companys products in each of its major end markets, particularly in the industrial, communication and high end consumer markets. The average selling price for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005 was relatively unchanged at $1.44 per unit as compared to $1.40 per unit in fiscal 2004. In addition to product sales, the Company entered into a long term royalty agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 that accounted for $40.0 million of net revenues for the year. The $40.0 million represents past royalties under terms of the settlement and license agreement with the other company. The Company expects to earn future royalties, which are dependent on sales of licensed products by the other company, quarterly from July 2005 through June 2013. Such ongoing quarterly royalty revenue is not expected to be material to each individual quarters net revenues. Geographically, international net revenues were $731.0 million or 70% of net revenues for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005, an increase of $161.3 million as compared to international net revenues of $569.7 million or 71% of net revenues for the same period in fiscal 2004. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World ("ROW"), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $414.3 million or 39% of net revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $173.8 million or 17% of net revenues and $142.9 million or 14% of net revenues, respectively. Domestic net revenues were $318.7 million or 30% of net revenues for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005, an increase of $81.1 million as compared to net domestic revenues of $237.6 million or 29% of net revenues in the same period in fiscal 2004. The $81.1 million increase in domestic net revenues includes the $40.0 million royalty mentioned above. Net revenues for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004 were $807.3 million, an increase of $200.7 million or 33% over net revenues of $606.6 million for the same period of the previous fiscal year. The increase in net revenues for the twelve month period was due to a significant increase in unit volume as demand increased for the 16 Companys products in each of its major end markets, particularly in the industrial and communication markets. This increase in unit volume was enhanced by significant growth in sales of smaller packaged products that go into a wide variety of hand held products such as cellular phones and MP3 players. The significant increase in unit volume was offset partially by a reduction in average selling price, which decreased to $1.40 in fiscal 2004 from $1.57 in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of the change in sales mix towards smaller packages which carry lower average selling prices. Geographically, international net revenues were $569.7 million or 71% of net revenue for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004, an increase of $156.3 million as compared to international net revenues of $413.4 million or 68% of net revenues for the same period in fiscal 2003. Internationally, sales to ROW represented $309.1 million or 38% of net revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $140.4 million or 18% of net revenues and $120.2 million or 15% of net revenues, respectively. Domestic net revenues were $237.6 million or 29% of net revenues for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004, an increase of $44.4 million as compared to domestic net revenues of $193.2 million or 32% of net revenues in the same period in fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased in absolute dollars both internationally and domestically, however the decline in domestic net revenues as a percentage of net revenues and the respective increase in international net revenues as a percentage of net revenues resulted primarily from the Companys domestic customers shifting more of their manufacturing operations overseas. The Company ends every fiscal quarter on the Sunday nearest calendar month end. Roughly, every five years the Company has a 53 week rather than a 52 week fiscal year. Fiscal 2005 is a 53 week year with the additional week falling in the three month period ending January 2, 2005. For the twelve months ended July 3, 2005, the extra week had a minimal effect on net revenues. The extra week resulted in slightly higher compensation costs in the Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative lines of the Income Statement. The increase in compensation costs for Cost of Goods Sold was largely offset by lower per unit manufacturing costs resulting from an extra week of production volume. The Company received a benefit from the extra week in Interest Income because it earned an extra week of interest income from its cash investment balance. Gross profit for the year ended July 3, 2005 was $830.5 million, an increase of $209.2 million or 34% over gross profit of $621.3 million in fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 79.1% of net revenues in fiscal 2005 as compared to 77.0% of net revenues in fiscal 2004. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across higher net revenues. The $40.0 million dollar royalty also caused a one time improvement in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues due to the royalty having minimal incremental production costs. Gross profit for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $621.3 million, an increase of $169.8 million or 38% over gross profit of $451.5 million in fiscal 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 77.0% of net revenues in fiscal 2004 as compared to 74.4% of net revenues in fiscal 2003. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across higher net revenues. The decrease in average selling price referred to above did not have a commensurate effect on gross margin. Most of the reduction in average selling price was due to a change in product mix as the Company has had increased sales of products with smaller die and package types, which have a smaller average selling price, but also lower costs. Research and development ("R&D") expense for the year ended July 3, 2005 was $131.4 million, an increase of $26.8 million or 26% over R&D expense of $104.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in R&D was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in compensation costs. The increase in compensation expense related to the extra week of labor, increased headcount and annual merit increases which totaled $6.8 million; the increase in compensation expense related to restricted stock grants totaled $7.0 million; and, since the Company had better operating results, increased R&D profit sharing totaled $7.1 million. The related employer taxes and other fringe costs on these increases was $1.9 million. In addition to compensation costs, the Company had a $4.0 million increase in R&D related expenses such as third party technology licenses, legal fees, supplies, mask costs and test wafers. R&D expense for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $104.6 million, an increase of $13.2 million or 14% over R&D expense of $91.4 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in R&D was primarily due to a $10.6 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs increased as the result of increases to the profit sharing accrual, employee headcount, annual merit increases, and the related fringe on these increases. Since the Company had better operating results, R&D profit sharing grew $5.5 million while compensation related to headcount, annual merit increases and the related fringe on these increases together totaled $5.1 million. In addition, the Company had a $2.6 million increase in non compensation costs, primarily software maintenance amortization, supplies and depreciation. 17 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense for the year ended July 3, 2005 was $109.4 million, an increase of $29.4 million or 37% over SG&A expense of $80.0 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in SG&A was due to a $20.8 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation related to the extra week of labor, increased headcount and annual merit increases totaled $3.5 million; compensation expense related to restricted stock grants totaled $11.0 million; and, since the Company had better operating results, increased SG&A profit sharing totaled $5.2 million. The related employer taxes and other fringe costs on these increases was $1.1 million. In addition to compensation costs, the Company had a $5.5 million increase in legal expenses and a $3.1 million increase in expenses related to advertising, commissions for the Companys independent sales representatives and travel costs. SG&A expense for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $80.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million or 22% over SG&A expense of $65.6 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in SG&A was due to a $10.5 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs grew as the result of increases to the profit sharing accrual, employee headcount, annual merit increases and commissions. Since the Company had better operating results, SG&A profit sharing grew $4.0 million while compensation related to headcount, annual merit increases and commissions together totaled $6.5 million. In addition to compensation costs, the Company had a $3.9 million increase in SG&A related expenses for advertising, outside services and travel costs. Interest income, net increased 19% in fiscal 2005 to $30.3 million from $25.5 million in fiscal 2004. Interest income, net increased in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 due to the higher average interest rate earned on the Companys average cash balance; the interest income earned on the increase of the Companys average cash balance and the extra week of accrued interest income resulting from the 53 week work year. Interest income, net decreased 34% in fiscal 2004 to $25.5 million from $38.7 million in fiscal 2003. Interest income, net decreased in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 due to the decline in average interest rates earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalent and short term investment balance which was partially offset by the interest earned on the $63.0 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balance. Also contributing to the decline in interest income, net was the increase in interest expense on the Companys long term royalty agreement. Interest expense for the year ended June 27, 2004 was $2.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million over interest expense of $0.5 million in fiscal 2003. The Companys effective tax rate was 30% in fiscal 2005 and 29% in fiscal 2004 and 2003. The increase in the tax rate from 29% in fiscal 2004 to 30% in fiscal 2005 is due to the diminishing percentage that tax exempt interest income is of total taxable income. The tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to business activity in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates, tax exempt interest income and the tax credits received by the Company for qualified R&D expenditures. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the Malaysian government agreed to extend the Companys partial tax holiday through July 2015. In addition to the Malaysian tax holiday, the Company also has a partial tax holiday in Singapore through 2011 that may be extended through 2014 provided that the Company fulfills additional investment requirements in qualifying activities. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in "Risks and Competition" located in the "Business" section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal 2005 was a good year for the Company, net revenues and net income grew 30% and 32%, respectively, over fiscal 2004. For the first time in the Companys history net revenues reached $1.0 billon, which included a $40.0 million royalty. The royalty revenue was a significant event for the Company since it confirms the strength of its intellectual property. Going forward it continues to be a challenging environment to forecast upcoming results. The June quarter book to bill ratio was slightly less than one, which therefore lowered backlog. Consequently, the September quarter will require a modestly higher percentage of "turns" business, which is orders that must be booked and shipped in the same period. The Company expects that bookings will increase in the September quarter. The Companys September quarter usually begins to show strength in its consumer oriented business although the industrial and communication 18 business is generally slower for the Company. Macro economic trends continue to improve and the September quarter has started strong, with July being the strongest four week booking month that the Company has had in over a year. Given the above data points and other factors, the Company expects that sales for the September quarter will be similar to the quarter just completed. The Company will begin expensing stock options in the September quarter, which will have an adverse impact on earnings. The Company estimates that total stock based compensation will impact net income by approximately 10% or roughly $0.03 cents a share for the September quarter. Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance of the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the Company, are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability. The Companys headquarters and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California, consequently, the Company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At July 3, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.8 billion and working capital was $1.8 billion. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 7.0 million shares of its common stock for $257.2 million and distributed $111.0 million in dividends. After taking into consideration the cash used for these purchases and dividend payments, the Company generated additional cash and short term investments of $134.4 million. The Companys accounts receivable balance increased $46.7 million from $79.1 million at the end of fiscal 2004 to $125.8 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The increase is due to higher sales and higher day sales outstanding (DSO) which increased from a historical low of 30 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to a more representative 45 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. DSO of 30 days was unusually low last year due to unusually high collections at the end of the period. Fourth quarter collections in 2004 were $19.0 million higher than shipments. The Companys accrued payroll and related benefits balance increased $9.5 million from $54.3 million at the end of fiscal 2004 to $63.8 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to increases in the Companys profit sharing accrual. The Company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters. During fiscal 2005, the Company generated $492.7 million of cash from operating activities and $72.7 million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans. During fiscal 2005, significant cash expenditures included repurchasing $257.2 million of common stock, payments of $111.0 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $0.08 per share per quarter for the first and second quarters and $0.10 per share per quarter for the third and fourth quarters, $62.1 million for the purchase of capital assets and net purchases of short term investments of $15.4 million. In July, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid during the September quarter of fiscal 2006. The payment of future dividends will be based on quarterly financial performance. The Company has no debt and has historically satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future. 19 As of July 3, 2005, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. At the end of fiscal 2005 the Company entered into a purchase agreement of approximately $22.0 million for two buildings it currently leases. The agreement is contingent upon the owner selling a third building that the Company currently leases. The effect of the agreement will not be significant to the Companys overall results of operation or financial position. The Company did not have any other significant contractual obligation outside of operating leases as disclosed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on this Annual Report on Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at July 3, 2005, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $11.7 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. The Company generally holds securities until maturity. The Companys sales outside the United States are transacted in U.S. dollars; accordingly, the Companys sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. To date, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on the results of operations. 20
