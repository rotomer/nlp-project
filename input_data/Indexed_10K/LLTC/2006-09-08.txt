ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to stock based compensation, inventory valuation, revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R) ("SFAS 123R"). Under SFAS 123R, compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes valuation model. The compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the vesting period. The Company uses the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as expected term, volatility, dividend yields and risk free interest rates that determine the stock options fair value. If actual results are not consistent with the Companys assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. In addition, SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant. In subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate, the forfeiture rate may be revised. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its historical activity, as it believes these forfeiture rates to be indicative of its expected forfeiture rate. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. The Company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand. The Company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate. In addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts, judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability, obsolescence, historical experience and current business conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title, which generally occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue from the Companys sales to domestic distributors is generally recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. As a result, the Company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise. The Company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms. The income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as "Deferred income on shipments to distributors" until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company has reserves to cover expected product returns. If product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations, the Company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns. Generally, changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin. Income Taxes The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, such as the tax benefit for export sales, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period. The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If the Company determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, in concert with a review of its total tax liabilities, it may reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary. The Company will also record an additional charge to its provision for taxes in the period in which it determines that the recorded tax liability is less than it expects the ultimate assessment to be. For a discussion of current tax matters, see "Note 6. Income Taxes" and "Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Results of Operations Effective July 4, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the consolidated financial statements. Prior to July 4, 2005, the Company accounted for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) opinion No. 25. The Company implemented SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, periods prior to July 4, 2005 are not restated to reflect stockbased compensation using a fair value method. The adoption of SFAS 123R to some extent affects the comparability of financial performance between fiscal years 2006 and 2005. The table below states the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change July 2, July 3, June 27, 2006 Over 2005 Over 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 4 % 30 % Cost of sales 21.8 20.9 23.0 9 18 Gross profit 78.2 79.1 77.0 3 34 Expenses: Research & development 14.7 12.5 13.0 22 26 Selling, general & administrative 11.9 10.4 9.9 19 37 26.6 22.9 22.9 21 30 Operating income 51.6 56.2 54.1 (4 ) 35 Interest income, net 4.8 2.9 3.2 74 19 Income before income taxes 56.4 % 59.1 % 57.3 % (1 ) 34 Effective tax rates 30.5 % 30.0 % 29.0 % Revenues for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006 were $1,093.0 million, an increase of $43.3 million or 4% over revenues of $1,049.7 million for fiscal year 2005. Fiscal year 2005 revenue had two components, net product sales of $1,009.7 million and as discussed below, royalty revenue of $40.0 million. Fiscal year 2006 revenues increased in the Companys industrial, high end consumer and automotive end markets and decreased in the computer end market when compared to fiscal year 2005. The average selling price ("ASP") for fiscal year 2006 increased to $1.62 per unit over $1.44 per unit in fiscal year 2005. The increase in ASP over the prior year was due to a shift in the mix of products sold. Increases in sales of products that go into industrial and automotive end markets that have higher ASPs were partially offset by a decrease in sales of products that go into the handset portion of the communication end market and the computer end market. Geographically, international revenues were $760.4 million or 70% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006, an increase of $29.4 million as compared to international revenues of $731.0 million or 70% of revenues for the same period in fiscal year 2005. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World ("ROW"), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $415.2 million or 38% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $191.7 million or 18% of revenues and $153.5 million or 14% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $332.6 million or 30% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006, an increase of $13.9 million as compared to domestic revenues of $318.7 million or 30% of revenues in the same period in fiscal year 2005. Royalty revenue included in revenue for fiscal year 2006 was not material. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company entered into a long term royalty agreement that accounted for $40.0 million of total revenues for the quarter and the fiscal year. The $40.0 million represented past royalties under the terms of a settlement and license agreement with another company. The Company expects to earn future royalties, which are dependent on sales of licensed products, quarterly through June 2013. Such ongoing quarterly royalty revenue is not expected to be material to each individual quarters total revenue. The past royalty revenue recognized in the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 had related costs. Legal expenses were charged to research and development ("R&D") and selling and general administrative ("SG&A"); and profit sharing related to the past royalty was charged to cost of sales, R&D and SG&A. Revenues for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005 were $1,049.7 million, an increase of $242.4 million or 30% over revenues of $807.3 million for the same period of the previous fiscal year. As mentioned above, the $242.4 million increase included a $40.0 million royalty. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in unit volume for the twelve month period. Demand increased for the Companys products in each of its major end markets, particularly in the industrial, communication and high end consumer markets. The average selling price for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005 was relatively unchanged at $1.44 per unit as compared to $1.40 per unit in fiscal year 2004. Geographically, international revenues were $731.0 million or 70% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005, an increase of $161.3 million as compared to international revenues of $569.7 million or 71% of revenues for the same period in fiscal year 2004. Internationally, sales to ROW represented $414.3 million or 39% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $173.8 million or 17% of revenues and $142.9 million or 14% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $318.7 million or 30% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 3, 2005, an increase of $81.1 million as compared to domestic revenues of $237.6 million or 29% of revenues in the same period in fiscal year 2004. The $81.1 million increase in domestic revenues includes the $40.0 million royalty mentioned above. Gross profit for the year ended July 2, 2006 was $854.6 million, an increase of $24.1 million or 3% over gross profit of $830.5 million in fiscal year 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 78.2% of revenues in fiscal year 2006 as compared to 79.1% of revenues in fiscal year 2005. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to increased costs related to stock based compensation and profit sharing. In addition, the $40.0 million dollar royalty recognized in fiscal year 2005 caused a one time improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues due to the royalty having minimal incremental production costs. Gross profit for the year ended July 3, 2005 was $830.5 million, an increase of $209.2 million or 34% over gross profit of $621.3 million in fiscal year 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 79.1% of revenues in fiscal year 2005 as compared to 77.0% of revenues in fiscal year 2004. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across higher revenues. The $40.0 million dollar royalty also caused a one time improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues due to the royalty having minimal incremental production costs. R&D expense for the year ended July 2, 2006 was $160.8 million, an increase of $29.4 million or 22% over R&D expense of $131.4 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in R&D was primarily due to costs related to stock based compensation as required under SFAS 123R, which was adopted by the Company in fiscal year 2006. As a result, stock based compensation increased $17.7 million over fiscal year 2005. In addition, R&D increased $9.1 million due to increases in employee compensation costs caused by increases in employee headcount and annual merit. Profit sharing increased $1.7 million. Other R&D expenses were up $0.9 million mainly due to mask costs and software maintenance agreements. R&D expense for the year ended July 3, 2005 was $131.4 million, an increase of $26.8 million or 26% over R&D expense of $104.6 million in fiscal year 2004. The increase in R&D was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in compensation costs. The increase in compensation expense related to increased headcount and annual merit increases totaled $6.8 million; the increase in compensation expense related to restricted stock grants totaled $7.0 million; and since the Company had better operating results, increased R&D profit sharing totaled $7.1 million. The related employer taxes and other fringe costs on these increases was $1.9 million. In addition to compensation costs, the Company had a $4.0 million increase in R&D related expenses such as third party technology licenses, legal fees, supplies, mask costs and test wafers. SG&A expense for the year ended July 2, 2006 was $129.8 million, an increase of $20.4 million or 19% over SG&A expense of $109.4 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to costs related to stock based compensation as required under SFAS 123R, which was adopted by the Company in fiscal year 2006. As a result, stock based compensation increased $10.8 million over fiscal year 2005. In addition, SG&A increased $6.8 million due to increases in employee compensation costs caused by increases in employee headcount and annual merit. Profit sharing increased $1.3 million. Other SG&A costs were up $1.5 million mainly due to legal and travel expenses. SG&A expense for the year ended July 3, 2005 was $109.4 million, an increase of $29.4 million or 37% over SG&A expense of $80.0 million in fiscal year 2004. The increase in SG&A was due to a $20.8 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs related to increased headcount and annual merit increases totaled $3.5 million; compensation expense related to restricted stock grants totaled $11.0 million; and since the Company had better operating results, increased SG&A profit sharing totaled $5.2 million. The related employer taxes and other fringe costs on these increases was $1.1 million. In addition to compensation costs, the Company had a $5.5 million increase in legal expenses and a $3.1 million increase in expenses related to advertising, commissions for the Companys independent sales representatives and travel costs. Interest income, net, for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006 was $52.9 million, an increase of $22.6 million or 74% over interest income, net of $30.3 million in fiscal year 2005. Interest income, net increased in fiscal year 2006 when compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to the higher average interest rate earned on the Companys average cash balance. Interest income, net, increased 19% in fiscal year 2005 to $30.3 million from $25.5 million in fiscal year 2004. Interest income, net increased in fiscal year 2005 when compared to fiscal year 2004 due to the higher average interest rate earned on the Companys average cash balance; the interest income earned on the increase of the Companys average cash balance and the extra week of accrued interest income resulting from the 53 week work year. The Companys effective tax rate was 30.5% in fiscal year 2006, 30% in fiscal year 2005 and 29% in fiscal year 2004. The increase in the tax rate from 30% in fiscal year 2005 to 30.5% in fiscal year 2006 is due to lower tax benefits received from the Companys export sales, as well as qualified research and development expenditures offset partially by an increase in tax exempt interest income and the new deduction received for domestic manufacturing activities. The tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to business activity in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates, tax exempt interest income, domestic manufacturing deduction and the tax credits received by the Company for qualified R&D expenditures. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Malaysian government agreed to extend the Companys partial tax holiday through July 2015. In addition to the Malaysian tax holiday, the Company also has a partial tax holiday in Singapore through 2011 that may be extended through 2014 provided that the Company fulfills additional investment requirements in qualifying activities. 12 Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in "Risks and Competition" located in the "Business" section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Fiscal year 2006 was a good year for the Company. Revenues grew 4% over fiscal year 2005 and the Company achieved a 39% return on sales (net income/revenues) including the effects of all forms of stock based compensation as a result of the Company implementing SFAS 123R in fiscal year 2006. The Company achieved record annual revenues of $1.09 billion during fiscal year 2006 with strong product sales growth in the last three quarters of the fiscal year. Looking forward, the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 is a difficult quarter to forecast. It is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication businesses, yet should show growing strength in consumer oriented business as the build period for the holiday season begins. The Company has previously disclosed in press releases that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the United States Justice Department have initiated informal inquiries into the Companys stock option granting practices. For more information see ITEM 3. "Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance of the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the Company, are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability. The Companys headquarters, and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Consequently, the Company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At July 2, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.8 billion and working capital was also $1.8 billion. The Companys accounts receivable balance increased $28.4 million from $125.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2005 to $154.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2006. The increase is due to higher revenues from product sales while day sales outstanding ("DSO") remained relatively unchanged at 48 days. Other non current assets increased $7.9 million from $57.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2005 to $65.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2006 due to the Company making an investment in a digital power semiconductor company. This increase was partially offset by amortization of long term technology licenses. The Companys accrued payroll and related benefits balance increased $5.7 million from $63.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2005 to $69.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2006. The increase is primarily due to increases in the Companys profit sharing accrual. The Company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters. During fiscal year 2006, the Company generated $510.0 million of cash from operating activities, $68.6 million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans, and proceeds from net sales of short term investments of $185.6 million. During fiscal year 2006, significant cash expenditures included the repurchasing $342.8 million of its common stock, payments of $153.9 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing $0.10 per share per quarter for the first and second quarters and $0.15 per share per quarter for the third and fourth quarters, $69.4 million for the purchase of capital assets and the purchase of a long term equity investment of $13.4 million. In July, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid during the September quarter of fiscal year 2007. The payment of future dividends will be based on quarterly financial performance. In addition, at the July 2006 Board of Directors meeting, the Companys Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional 20 million shares of its common stock over a two year period. The Company has no debt and has historically satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations The Company did not have any significant contractual obligations other than operating leases as disclosed in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of July 2, 2006, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at July 2, 2006, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $10.0 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. The Company generally holds securities until maturity. The Companys sales outside the United States are transacted in U.S. dollars; accordingly, the Companys sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. To date, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on the results of operations. 13
