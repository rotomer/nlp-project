ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to stock based compensation, inventory valuation, revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R) (SFAS 123R). Under SFAS 123R, stock option cost is calculated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes valuation model. The compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the vesting period. The Company uses the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as expected term, volatility, dividend yields and risk free interest rates that determine the stock options fair value. If actual results are not consistent with the Companys assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. In addition, SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant. In subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate, the forfeiture rate may be revised. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its historical activity, as it believes these forfeiture rates to be indicative of its expected forfeiture rate. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. The Company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand. The Company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate. In addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts, judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability, obsolescence, historical experience and current business conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title, which generally occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue from the Companys sales to domestic distributors is generally recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. As a result, the Company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise. The Company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms. The income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company has reserves to cover expected product returns. If product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations, the Company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns. Generally, changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin. 22 Income Taxes The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, such as the tax benefit for export sales, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period. The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If the Company determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, in concert with a review of its total tax liabilities, it may reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary. The Company will also record an additional charge to its provision for taxes in the period in which it determines that the recorded tax liability is less than it expects the ultimate assessment to be. For a discussion of current tax matters, see Note 8. Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Results of Operations Effective July 4, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the consolidated financial statements. Prior to July 4, 2005, the Company accounted for stockbased compensation awards in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25. The Company implemented SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, periods prior to July 4, 2005 are not restated to reflect stockbased compensation using a fair value method. The adoption of SFAS 123R to some extent affects the comparability of financial performance between fiscal years 2007 and 2006 versus 2005 because fiscal year 2005 does not have stock option expense. The table below states the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change July 1, July 2, July 3, 2007 Over 2006 Over 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Revenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% (1%) 4% Cost of sales 22.3 21.8 20.9 1 9 Gross profit 77.7 78.2 79.1 (2) 3 Expenses: Research & development 17.0 14.7 12.5 14 22 Selling, general & administrative 12.3 11.9 10.4 3 19 29.3 26.6 22.9 9 21 Operating income 48.4 51.6 56.2 (7) (4) Interest expense (1.1) (0.2) (0.2) 545 (8) Interest income 5.3 5.0 3.1 5 69 Income before income taxes 52.6% 56.4% 59.1% (8) (1) Effective tax rates 27.8% 30.5% 30.0% Revenues for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 were $1,083.1 million, a decrease of $9.9 million or 1% from revenues of $1,093.0 million for fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2007 revenues decreased in most of the Companys end markets except automotive. The average selling price (ASP) for fiscal year 2007 was relatively flat at $1.60 per unit compared to $1.62 per unit in fiscal year 2006. Geographically, international revenues were $738.1 million or 68% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007, a decrease of $22.3 million as compared to international revenues of $760.4 million or 70% of revenues for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $402.4 million or 37% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $193.1 million or 18% of revenues and $142.6 million or 13% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $345.0 million or 32% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007, an increase of $12.4 million over domestic revenues of $332.6 million or 30% of revenues in the same period in fiscal year 2006. 23 Royalty revenues included in revenue for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were not material. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company entered into a long term royalty agreement that accounted for $40.0 million of total revenues for the quarter and the fiscal year. The $40.0 million represented past royalties under the terms of a settlement and license agreement with another company. The Company expects to earn future royalties, which are dependent on sales of licensed products, quarterly through June 2013. Such ongoing quarterly royalty revenue is not expected to be material to each individual quarters total revenue. Revenues for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006 were $1,093.0 million, an increase of $43.3 million or 4% over revenues of $1,049.7 million for fiscal year 2005. Fiscal year 2005 revenue had two components, net product sales of $1,009.7 million and as discussed above, royalty revenue of $40.0 million. Fiscal year 2006 revenues increased in the Companys industrial, high end consumer and automotive end markets and decreased in the computer end market when compared to fiscal year 2005. The average selling price (ASP) for fiscal year 2006 increased to $1.62 per unit over $1.44 per unit in fiscal year 2005. The increase in ASP over the prior year was due to a shift in the mix of products sold. Increases in sales of products that go into industrial and automotive end markets that have higher ASPs were partially offset by a decrease in sales of products that go into the handset portion of the communication end market and the computer end market. Geographically, international revenues were $760.4 million or 70% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006, an increase of $29.4 million as compared to international revenues of $731.0 million or 70% of revenues for the same period in fiscal year 2005. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $415.2 million or 38% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $191.7 million or 18% of revenues and $153.5 million or 14% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $332.6 million or 30% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006, an increase of $13.9 million as compared to domestic revenues of $318.7 million or 30% of revenues in the same period in fiscal year 2005. Gross profit for the year ended July 1, 2007 was $841.6 million, a decrease of $13.0 million or 2% from gross profit of $854.6 million in fiscal year 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 77.7% of revenues in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 78.2% of revenues in fiscal year 2006. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to increases in costs related to stock based compensation of $3.2 million and spreading fixed costs over a lower revenue base. These decreases were partially offset by lower profit sharing. Gross profit for the year ended July 2, 2006 was $854.6 million, an increase of $24.1 million or 3% over gross profit of $830.5 million in fiscal year 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 78.2% of revenues in fiscal year 2006 as compared to 79.1% of revenues in fiscal year 2005. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to increased costs related to stock based compensation and profit sharing. In addition, the $40.0 million dollar royalty recognized in fiscal year 2005 caused a one time improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues due to the royalty having minimal incremental production costs. Research and development (R&D) expense for the year ended July 1, 2007 was $183.6 million, an increase of $22.7 million or 14% over R&D expense of $160.8 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase in R&D was due to an $11.1 million increase in compensation costs related to employee headcount and annual merit. The increase in R&D expense was also due to higher costs related to stock based compensation, which increased $12.5 million. In addition, the Company had a $6.0 million increase in other R&D related expenses such as legal costs, mask costs and small tool charges. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in profit sharing of $6.9 million. R&D expense for the year ended July 2, 2006 was $160.8 million, an increase of $29.4 million or 22% over R&D expense of $131.4 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in R&D was primarily due to costs related to stock based compensation as required under SFAS 123R, which was adopted by the Company in fiscal year 2006. As a result, stock based compensation increased $17.7 million over fiscal year 2005. In addition, R&D increased $9.1 million due to increases in employee compensation costs caused by increases in employee headcount and annual merit. Profit sharing increased $1.7 million. Other R&D expenses were up $0.9 million mainly due to mask costs and software maintenance agreements. Selling general and administrative (SG&A) expense for the year ended July 1, 2007 was $133.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 3% over SG&A expense of $129.8 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase in SG&A was due to a $6.5 million increase in compensation costs related to employee headcount and annual merit. In addition to compensation costs the Company had a $0.9 million increase in stock based compensation and a $3.0 million increase in legal expenses. Offsetting these increases was a $5.0 million decrease in profit sharing and a $1.5 million decrease in other SG&A costs. SG&A expense for the year ended July 2, 2006 was $129.8 million, an increase of $20.4 million or 19% over SG&A expense of $109.4 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to costs related to stock based compensation as required under SFAS 123R, which was adopted by the Company in fiscal year 2006. As a result, stock based compensation increased $10.8 million over fiscal year 2005. In addition, SG&A increased $6.8 million due to increases in employee compensation costs caused by increases in employee headcount and annual merit. Profit sharing increased $1.3 million. Other SG&A costs were up $1.5 million mainly due to legal and travel expenses. 24 Interest expense for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 was $12.1 million, an increase of $10.2 million over interest expense of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase in interest expense was due to the Companys issuance of $1.7 billion Convertible Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 bearing interest at 3.0% and 3.125%. Total interest expense of $12.1 million included charges of $10.4 million related to the convertible debt which comprised convertible debt interest, amortization of the convertible debt discount and amortization of service fees. Interest expense for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006 was $1.9 million, which was relatively flat, in comparison with the $2.0 million interest expense for fiscal year 2005. Interest income for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 was $57.7 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 5% over interest income of $54.7 million in fiscal year 2006. Interest income increased in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the higher average interest rate earned on the Companys average cash balance. Offsetting the effect of higher interest rates was the decrease in the Companys average cash and short term investment balance as the Company used $1.3 billion of its cash to fund a $3.0 billion ASR transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. Interest income for the twelve months ended July 2, 2006 was $54.7 million, an increase of $22.3 million or 69% over interest income of $32.4 million in fiscal year 2005. Interest income increased due to the increase in the average interest rate earned on the Companys cash and short term investment balance, partially offset by a decrease in the Companys average cash and short term investment balance. The Companys effective tax rate was 27.8% in fiscal year 2007, 30.5% in fiscal year 2006 and 30% in fiscal year 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007 is primarily the result of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit legislation during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, an increase in foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and higher tax exempt interest. In addition, the Company received a one time tax benefit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 as the Company settled with the Internal Revenue Service certain disputed tax benefits for fiscal years 1997 2001 related to its Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC). The Company revised its tax reserves accordingly as a result of settling the FSC issue. The increase in the tax rate from 30% in fiscal year 2005 to 30.5% in fiscal year 2006 is due to lower tax benefits received from the Companys export sales, as well as qualified research and development expenditures offset partially by an increase in tax exempt interest income and the new deduction received for domestic manufacturing activities. The Companys effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower tax rates on the earnings of its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, principally Singapore and Malaysia. The Company has a partial tax holiday through July 2015 in Malaysia and a partial tax holiday in Singapore through 2011 that may be extended through 2014 provided that the Company fulfills additional investment requirements in qualifying activities. In addition, the Company receives a tax benefit from certain R&D spending and non taxable interest income. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in Item 1A Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company ended its 2007 fiscal year on a positive note with sequential quarterly increases to revenues and operating margin as a percentage of revenues. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company significantly improved its capital structure through the issuance of $1.7 billion of Convertible Senior Notes and a subsequent $3.0 billion ASR transaction that was funded by the Notes and $1.3 billion of the Companys cash. The Companys bookings grew in the quarter and the Company is going into the September quarter with a larger backlog and a slightly lower turns requirement than in previous quarters. Turns are orders that must be both booked and shipped in the same quarter. The Companys lead times have remained unchanged at 4 to 6 weeks. Looking ahead to the September quarter the Company believes that most of the major inventory corrections are over and that orders placed on the Company and the corresponding shipments should reflect improving market demand. Most of the Companys customers continue to be cautious, but not as guarded, in their outlook. Although the overall semiconductor market growth outlook is not strong the financial performance of the Company and most of its competitors improved in the June quarter over the March quarter. Considering these factors, the Company currently expects revenue to grow approximately 4% to 6% in the September quarter with EPS increasing more in the high end of that range, as the September quarter will have the full impact of the $3.0 billion ASR. The Company anticipates that net interest expense will be approximately $9.3 million; the effective income tax rate before discrete items will be 29.5%; and diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 235.0 million. 25 Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance of the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the Company, are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability. The Companys headquarters, and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Consequently, the Company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At July 1, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $633.3 million and working capital was $681.2 million. These amounts were substantially reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 as a result of the Companys $3.0 billion ASR transaction of which the Company used $1.3 billion of its own cash to fund; the remaining $1.7 billion was funded through the Convertible Senior Note offering. The Companys cash and short term investment balance decreased $1.2 billion from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the ASR. The Company believes that repurchasing stock represents an opportunity to use its large cash and short term investment balance, together with some leveraging of the Companys strong cashflow from operations, to enhance long term shareholder value. Presently, the Company intends to repay its debt, when due, with cash generated from operations over the debt period. The Companys accounts receivable balance decreased $23.8 million from $154.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2006 to $130.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2007. The decrease is primarily due to lower shipments. The Companys inventory balance increased $12.0 million due to an increase in the Companys work in process inventory, primarily in unpackaged die or die bank. Inventory remained flat between the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The Companys prepaid expense and other current asset balance decreased $8.4 million due to lower accrued interest income as a result of the Company using $1.3 billion of its cash and short term investments to fund the $3.0 billion ASR. Net property, plant and equipment increased $18.6 million during fiscal year 2007. Additions totaled $62.0 million primarily due to the purchase of production equipment. These increases were offset by depreciation of $43.4 million. The Companys other non current assets increased $25.4 million over the prior fiscal year primarily due to the Company capitalizing the $22.0 million offering discount related to its Convertible Senior Notes offering. The offering discount will be amortized over the debt periods of 3.5 years and 7 years. Accrued payroll and related benefits totaled $54.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2007, a decrease of $15.0 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the lower profit sharing accrual. The Company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters. Income taxes payable of $45.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2007 decreased $39.3 million from the previous fiscal year due to higher tax payments primarily as a result of the Companys payments for settling certain tax audits related to the FSC. Deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by $8.1 million from the prior fiscal year due to distributors managing their inventories more tightly. This is partially in response to suppliers utilizing shorter order lead times, inventory reductions at distributors end customers, and movement within the industry to reduce leaded inventory while moving to lead free integrated circuits. Other accrued liabilities increased $8.8 million over the prior fiscal year primarily due the increase in accrued interest of $9.7 million as a result of the Companys $1.7 billion convertible debt transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. Interest payments on the convertible debt are made semi annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. Convertible Senior Notes increased $1.7 billion during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due May 1, 2027. The Company used the entire net proceeds of the offering to fund a portion of its repurchase of approximately $3.0 billion of its common stock pursuant to an ASR transaction it entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser simultaneously with the offering of the Notes. As a result of the $3.0 billion ASR transaction the Companys stockholders equity reduced into a deficit of $708 million at July 1, 2007 from a positive balance of $2.1 billion at July 2, 2006 because, for accounting purposes the market value of the shares repurchased were recorded as a reduction to common stock, additional paid in capital, and retained earnings in stockholders equity. 26 During fiscal year 2007, the Company generated $1.7 billion in cash from the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes, $478.0 million of cash from operating activities, $808.8 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments, $84.5 million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans, and $14.2 million from excess tax benefits received on the exercise of stock awards. During fiscal year 2007, significant cash expenditures included $3.2 billion for repurchases of common stock, payments of $192.4 million for cash dividends to stockholders, representing $0.66 per share, and purchases of $62.0 million for capital assets. In July 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share. The $0.18 per share dividend will be paid during the September quarter of fiscal year 2008. The payment of future dividends will be based on financial performance. Historically, the Company has satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations at July 1, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future periods. (In Thousands) Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 and thereafter Operating lease obligations (1) $ 2,400 $ 1,900 $ 1,500 $ 1,100 $ 3,400 3.0% convertible debentures principal and interest (2) 30,000 30,000 30,000 30,000 85,000 3.125% convertible debentures principal and interest (3) 21,875 21,875 21,875 7,292 Total $ 54,275 $ 53,775 $ 53,375 $ 38,392 $ 88,400 (1) The Company leases some of its facilities under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2057. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information about operating leases. (2) In April 2007, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. The Company will pay cash interest at an annual rate of 3.0% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. (3) In April 2007, the Company issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. The Company will pay cash interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of July 1, 2007, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at July 1, 2007, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $3.6 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders (deficit) equity. The Company generally holds securities until maturity. The Companys sales outside the United States are transacted in U.S. dollars; accordingly, the Companys sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. To date, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on the results of operations. 27
