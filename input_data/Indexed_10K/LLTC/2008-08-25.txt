ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to stock based compensation, inventory valuation, revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under SFAS 123R, stock option cost is calculated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes valuation model. The compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the vesting period. The Company uses the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as expected option term, stock price volatility, dividend yields and risk free interest rates that determine the stock options fair value. If actual results are not consistent with the Companys assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. In addition, SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant. In subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate, the forfeiture rate may be revised. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its historical activity, as it believes these forfeiture rates to be indicative of its expected forfeiture rate. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. The Company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand. The Company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate. In addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts, judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability, obsolescence, historical experience and current business conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes approximately 16% of net revenues from domestic distributors that are recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of pricing rebates, the ultimate sales price on domestic distributor sales transactions is not fixed or determinable until domestic distributors sell the merchandise to the end user. At the time of shipment to domestic distributors, the Company records a trade receivable and deferred revenue at the distributor purchasing price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay for the products delivered. The Company relieves inventory as title has passed to the distributor and recognizes deferred cost of sales in the same amount. Deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the difference between deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales and is recognized as a current liability until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. At June 29, 2008, the Company had approximately $46.2 million of deferred revenue and $8.4 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as $37.8 million of Deferred income on shipment to distributors. At July 1, 2007, the Company had approximately $49.0 million of deferred revenue and $9.1 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as $39.9 million of Deferred income on shipment to distributors. To the extent the Company was to have a significant reduction in distributor price or grant significant price rebates, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross profit recognized. The price rebates that have been remitted back to distributors have ranged from $1.5 million to $3.1 million per quarter. 22 The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company has reserves to cover expected product returns. If product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations, the Company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns. Generally, changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin. Income Taxes The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period. The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48), and related guidance. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company has to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For a discussion of current tax matters, see Note 8. Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Results of Operations The table below states the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change June 29, July 1, July 2, 2008 Over 2007 Over 20081 20071 2006 2007 2006 Revenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 9% (1%) Cost of sales 22.7 22.3 21.8 11 1 Gross profit 77.3 77.7 78.2 8 (2) Expenses: Research & development 16.8 17.0 14.7 7 14 Selling, general & administrative 12.1 12.3 11.9 7 3 28.9 29.3 26.6 7 9 Operating income 48.4 48.4 51.6 8 (7) Interest expense (4.9) (1.1) (0.2) 378 545 Interest income 2.6 5.3 5.0 (48) 5 Income before income taxes 46.0% 52.6% 56.4% (5) (8) Effective tax rates 28.3% 27.8% 30.5% 1The results for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were impacted by the Company entering into a $3.0 billion Accelerated Stock Repurchase ("ASR") transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The ASR transaction was funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt. As a result, the Companys fiscal year 2008 and to a lesser extent fiscal year 2007 results have both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense which resulted in income before income taxes as a percentage of revenues to be lower than past results. Shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share ("EPS") decreased by 83.3 million or approximately 27% due to the ASR. The $3.0 billion ASR transaction along with the increase in revenues drove the significant increase in earnings per share during fiscal year 2008. Consequently, the ASR transaction has been accretive to EPS, as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the reduction in net income from higher interest expense and lower interest income. 23 Revenues for the twelve months ended June 29, 2008 were $1,175.2 million, an increase of $92.1 million or 9% over revenues of $1,083.1 million for fiscal year 2007. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Company selling more units into the industrial, communication, automotive, military and computer end markets while the high end consumer end market decreased slightly. The average selling price (ASP) for fiscal year 2008 decreased slightly to $1.56 per unit compared to $1.60 per unit in fiscal year 2007. Geographically, international revenues were $828.3 million or 70% of revenues for the twelve months ended June 29, 2008, an increase of $90.2 million as compared to international revenues of $738.1 million or 68% of revenues for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in international revenues as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to certain domestic OEM customers migrating their manufacturing to international subcontractors. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $461.5 million or 39% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $212.7 million or 18% of revenues and $154.1 million or 13% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $346.8 million or 30% of revenues for the twelve months ended June 29, 2008, an increase of $1.8 million over domestic revenues of $345.0 million or 32% of revenues in the same period in fiscal year 2007. Revenues for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 were $1,083.1 million, a decrease of $9.9 million or 1% from revenues of $1,093.0 million for fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2007 revenues decreased in most of the Companys end markets except automotive. The ASP for fiscal year 2007 was relatively flat at $1.60 per unit compared to $1.62 per unit in fiscal year 2006. Geographically, international revenues were $738.1 million or 68% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007, a decrease of $22.3 million as compared to international revenues of $760.4 million or 70% of revenues for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Internationally, sales to ROW, which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $402.4 million or 37% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $193.1 million or 18% of revenues and $142.6 million or 13% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $345.0 million or 32% of revenues for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007, an increase of $12.4 million over domestic revenues of $332.6 million or 30% of revenues in the same period in fiscal year 2006. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008 was $908.1 million, an increase of $66.6 million or 8% over gross profit of $841.6 million in fiscal year 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 77.3% of revenues in fiscal year 2008 as compared to 77.7% of revenues in fiscal year 2007. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to increases in profit sharing, a decrease in ASP and an increase in raw material costs such as gold. These increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation of $3.6 million and improved factory efficiency on higher sales volumes. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007 was $841.6 million, a decrease of $13.0 million or 2% from gross profit of $854.6 million in fiscal year 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 77.7% of revenues in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 78.2% of revenues in fiscal year 2006. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to increases in costs related to stock based compensation of $3.2 million and spreading fixed costs over a lower revenue base. These decreases were partially offset by lower profit sharing. Research and development (R&D) expense for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008 was $197.1 million, an increase of $13.5 million or 7% over R&D expense of $183.6 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase in R&D was due to an $11.4 million increase in compensation costs related to new employees, primarily circuit designers and support engineers, and annual salary increases. The increase in R&D expense was also due to higher costs related to profit sharing, which increased $5.0 million. In addition, the Company had a $1.7 million increase in other R&D related expenses such as legal costs, mask costs and small tool charges. Offsetting these increases was a $4.6 million decrease in stock based compensation. R&D expense for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007 was $183.6 million, an increase of $22.7 million or 14% over R&D expense of $160.8 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase in R&D was due to an $11.1 million increase in compensation costs related to an increase in employee headcount and annual salary increases. The increase in R&D expense was also due to higher costs related to stock based compensation, which increased $12.5 million. In addition, the Company had a $6.0 million increase in other R&D related expenses such as legal costs, mask costs and small tool charges. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in profit sharing of $6.9 million. Selling general and administrative (SG&A) expense for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008 was $142.4 million, an increase of $8.7 million or 7% over SG&A expense of $133.7 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase in SG&A was due to a $7.5 million increase in compensation costs related to new employees, primarily field sales engineers and annual salary increases. In addition to compensation costs the Company had a $3.7 million increase in profit sharing, a $1.3 million increase in legal expenses and a $0.7 million increase in other SG&A costs. Offsetting these increases was a $4.5 million decrease in stock based compensation. SG&A expense for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007 was $133.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 3% over SG&A expense of $129.8 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase in SG&A was due to a $6.5 million increase in compensation costs related to an increase in employee headcount and annual salary increases. In addition to compensation costs the Company had a $0.9 million increase in stock based compensation and a $3.0 million increase in legal expenses. Offsetting these increases was a $5.0 million decrease in profit sharing and a $1.5 million decrease in other SG&A costs. 24 Interest expense for the twelve months ended June 29, 2008 was $57.8 million, an increase of $45.7 million over interest expense of $12.1 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase in interest expense was due to the Companys issuance of $1.7 billion Convertible Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 bearing interest at 3.0% and 3.125%. Interest expense for fiscal year 2008 is primarily comprised of convertible debt interest, amortization of the convertible debt discount and amortization of issuance costs. Interest expense for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 was $12.1 million, an increase of $10.2 million over interest expense of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase in interest expense was due to the Companys issuance of $1.7 billion Convertible Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 bearing interest at 3.0% and 3.125%. Total interest expense of $12.1 million included charges of $10.4 million related to the convertible debt which comprised convertible debt interest, amortization of the convertible debt discount and amortization of service fees. Interest income for the twelve months ended June 29, 2008 was $30.1 million, a decrease of $27.6 million or 48% from interest income of $57.7 million in fiscal year 2007. Interest income decreased due to the Companys lower average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as the Company used $1.3 billion of its cash to fund a portion of its $3.0 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. Interest income for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 was $57.7 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 5% over interest income of $54.7 million in fiscal year 2006. Interest income increased in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the higher average interest rate earned on the Companys average cash balance. Offsetting the effect of higher interest rates was the decrease in the Companys average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as the Company used $1.3 billion of its cash to fund a $3.0 billion ASR transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Companys effective tax rate was 28.3% in fiscal year 2008 and 27.8% in fiscal year 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower R&D tax credits as the related tax benefit expired as of December 31, 2007. The Company believes that the R&D tax credit will be restored by legislation retroactive to the beginning of calendar year 2008, but there can be no assurance that this will happen. In addition, the effective tax rate is higher due to lower tax exempt interest income and the expiration of the ETI export tax benefit when compared to fiscal year 2007. Offsetting these increases to the effective tax rate was an increase in foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, higher domestic production tax benefits and the impact of quarterly discrete adjustments. The Companys effective tax rate was 27.8% in fiscal year 2007 and 30.5% in fiscal year 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007 is primarily the result of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit legislation during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, an increase in foreign earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and higher tax exempt interest income. In addition, the Company received a one time tax benefit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 as the Company settled with the Internal Revenue Service certain disputed tax benefits for fiscal years 1997 2001 related to its Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC). The Company revised its tax reserves accordingly as a result of settling the FSC issue. Fiscal year 2008 net income of $387.6 million decreased $24.1 million or 6% from $411.7 million reported in the previous fiscal year. However, fiscal year 2008 diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.71 increased by $0.32 per share or 23% over the previous fiscal year. The 23% increase in EPS occurred due to the Company entering into a $3.0 billion ASR transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 coupled with a 9% increase in revenues over fiscal year 2007. The ASR transaction was funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt. As a result, the Companys fiscal year 2008 results have both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense when compared to the previous fiscal year. However, shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS decreased by 83.3 million or approximately 27% due to the ASR. Consequently, the ASR transaction has been accretive to EPS, as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the reduction in net income from higher interest expense and lower interest income, and this, coupled with the increase in revenues caused the 23% increase in EPS. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products; increases in costs associated with utilities, transportation and raw materials; currency fluctuations; the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States and international markets and other factors described below and in Item 1A Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company met its guidance set at the beginning of the June quarter by growing revenues 3% and EPS 5% over the March quarter. The Company has grown revenues and EPS for five consecutive quarters in a difficult economic environment. The Companys strategy of diversification by geography and end market, emphasizing more traditional Linear Technology end markets, contributed to the Companys record annual revenues and EPS. Looking ahead, given the concerns about the economic difficulties particularly in the U.S.A., forecasting future results continues to be a challenge. While the Company had a positive book to bill ratio for the June quarter, the September quarter is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication infrastructure businesses. However, the Company expects the September quarter to have some strength in certain high end consumer end markets. Consequently, the Company presently estimates that revenues and income before taxes in the September quarter will be flat to up 2% sequentially from the June quarter. 25 Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance of the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the Company, are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At June 29, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $966.7 million and working capital was $1,070.4 million. The Companys accounts receivable balance increased $30.9 million from $130.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2007 to $161.4 million at the end of fiscal year 2008. The increase is primarily due to higher shipments in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. The Companys prepaid expenses and other current assets totaled $29.5 million, an increase of $18.4 million over the previous fiscal year primarily due to prepaid income taxes of $14.3 million and an increase in accrued interest income. Net property, plant and equipment decreased $5.5 million during fiscal year 2008. Additions totaled $35.3 million primarily due to the purchase of production equipment offset by depreciation of $40.8 million. Other non current assets decreased $13.9 million from $91.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2007 to $77.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of a strategic investment in a privately held company, with a book value of $14.4 million, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Accrued payroll and related benefits totaled $66.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, an increase of $12.0 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $10.8 million increase to the Companys profit sharing accrual. The Company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters. Income taxes payable totaled $19.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $25.5 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the reclassification of $63.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits to other long term liabilities as a result of the implementation of FIN 48 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. This effect was partially offset by the net of quarterly tax payments and the Companys tax provision. Other accrued liabilities of $34.2 million increased $5.3 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 primarily due to an increase in accrued legal costs. Deferred tax liabilities totaled $41.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, an increase of $29.0 million over the previous fiscal year primarily due to an increase in deferred taxes related to interest deductions for the Companys convertible senior debt. Other long term liabilities of $100.7 million increased $66.7 million over the previous fiscal year primarily due to the unrecognized tax benefit reclassification of $63.2 million noted above and due to the implementation of EITF 06 2, which resulted in a $9.7 million increase for accrued sabbaticals. During fiscal year 2008, the Company generated $530.3 million of cash from operating activities, $15.5 million net proceeds from the sale of a strategic investment in a privately held company, $82.4 million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans, and $12.7 million from excess tax benefits received on the exercise of stock awards. During fiscal year 2008, significant cash expenditures included $337.4 million of net purchase of short term investments, $99.0 million for repurchases of common stock, payments of $176.7 million for cash dividends to stockholders, representing $0.78 per share, and purchases of $35.3 million for capital assets. In July 2008, the Companys Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share. The $0.21 per share dividend will be paid on August 27, 2008 to stockholders of record on August 15, 2008. The payment of future dividends will be based on financial performance. 26 Historically, the Company has satisfied its quarterly liquidity needs through cash generated from operations. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity, capital expenditures requirements, and debt retirement for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations at June 29, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future periods. (In Thousands) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2013 and thereafter Operating lease obligations (1) $ 2,500 $ 2,400 $ 1,500 $ 800 $ 3,000 3.0% convertible debentures principal and interest (2) 30,000 30,000 30,000 30,000 1,055,000 3.125% convertible debentures principal and interest (3) 21,875 21,875 707,292 Total $ 54,375 $ 54,275 $ 738,792 $ 30,800 $ 1,058,000 (1) The Company leases some of its facilities under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2057. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information about operating leases. (2) In April 2007, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. The Company will pay cash interest at an annual rate of 3.0% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. The Company may redeem the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes for cash at any time on or after May 1, 2014, and holders may require the Company to repurchase the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes for cash on specified dates or upon a fundamental change. (3) In April 2007, the Company issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. The Company will pay cash interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. The Company may redeem the 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes for cash at any time on or after November 1, 2010, and holders may require the Company to repurchase the 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes for cash on specified dates or upon a fundamental change. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 29, 2008, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at June 29, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $8.3 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders deficit. The Company generally holds securities until maturity. The Companys sales outside the United States are transacted in U.S. dollars; accordingly, the Companys sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. 27
