Quarterly revenues of $366.2 million achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 increased $54.8 million or 18% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased 76% or $158.2 million over $208.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 were $1.17 billion, an increase of $201.5 million or 21% over revenues of $968.5 million for fiscal year 2009. The Company has recovered from the global economic downturn as third and fourth quarter revenues were record revenue quarters that exceeded pre recessionary highs. The Company showed improvements in each major geographical region and in most major end markets. Fourth quarter operating income increased $40.4 million or 26% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increase d $115.3 million or 146% over the fourth quarter of last year. Net income of $124.5 million increased $23.9 million or 24% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $73.1 million or 142% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 included a non cash loss of $10.5 million on the early retirement of debt. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased $0.10 cents per share over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $0.31 cents per share over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to stock based compensation, inventory valuation, revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized approximately 15% and 16%, respectively, of net revenues from domestic distributors that are recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of pricing rebates, the ultimate sales price on domestic distributor sales transactions is not fixed or determinable until domestic distributors sell the merchandise to the end user. At the time of shipment to domestic distributors, the Company records a trade receiv able and deferred revenue at the distributor purchasing price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay for the products delivered. The Company relieves inventory as title has passed to the distributor and recognizes deferred cost of sales in the same amount. Deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the difference between deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales and is recognized as a current liability until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. At June 27, 2010, the Company had approximately $41.6 million of deferred revenue and $7.9 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as $33.7 million of Deferred income on shipments to distributors. At June 28, 2009, the Company had approximately $34.7 million of deferred revenue and $6.2 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as $28.5 million of Deferred income on shipments to distributors. &#16 0;The Company believes that its deferred costs of revenues have limited risk of material impairment, as the Company offers stock rotation privileges to distributors (up to 3% to 5% of quarterly purchases) which enable distributors to rotate slow moving inventory. In addition, stock rotated inventory that is returned to the Company is generally resalable. The Company reviews distributor ending on hand inventory balances, as well as orders placed on the Company to ensure that distributors are not overstocking parts and are ordering to forecasted demand. To the extent the Company were to have a significant reduction in distributor price or grant significant price rebates, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross profit recognized. The price rebates that have been remitted back to distributors have ranged from $2.2 million to $3.2 million per quarter. 22 The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company has reserves to cover expected product returns. If product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations, the Company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns. Generally, changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin. Inventory Valuation The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. The Company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand. The Company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate. In addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts, judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability, obsolescence, historical experience and current business conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin. Stock Based Compensation The Company uses the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The stock options fair value is then amortized straight line over the vesting period, which is generally five years. The Black Scholes valuation model requires the Company to estimate key assumptions such as expected option term, stock price volatility, dividend yields and risk free interest rates that determine the stock options fair value. Higher volatility and longer expected terms result in a proportional increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate do not have as significant an effect on the calculation of fair value. As a result, if factors change and the Companys estimates of volatility and expected term were to increase or decrease, the Companys stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, if deferred taxes based on the Black Scholes valuation are greater than or less than the gain on the sale of the associated stock option, the Companys income tax expense could increase or decrease. Income Taxes The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period. The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the authoritative accounting literature. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company has to determine the probability of various po ssible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of current tax matters. Results of Operations The table below presents the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount. 23 Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Change June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 Over 2009 Over 2010 20091 20081 2009 2008 Revenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 21% (18%) Cost of sales 23.0 24.6 22.7 13 (11) Gross profit 77.0 75.4 77.3 23 (20) Expenses: Research & development 17.0 19.2 16.8 7 (6) Selling, general & administrative 11.8 13.3 12.1 8 (10) Restructuring 0.4 28.8 32.9 28.9 6 (6) Operating income 48.2 42.5 48.4 37 (28) Interest expense (6.5) (8.6) (7.6) (9) (8) Interest income 1.1 2.4 2.5 (44) (24) (Loss) gain on early retirement of convertible senior notes (0.9) 1.7 Income before income taxes 41.9% 38.0% 43.3% 33 (28) Tax rate 26.3% 21.6% 27.9% 1As adjusted for the adoption of authoritative accounting guidance for convertible debentures beginning in fiscal year 2010. Prior results have been retrospectively adjusted in accordance with such guidance. Revenue for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 was $1.17 billion, an increase of $201.5 million or 21% over revenue of $968.5 million for fiscal year 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the rapid recovery from the recent global economic downturn. The Companys revenues improved in each major geographical region and in most major end markets. The average selling price (ASP) for fiscal year 2010 increased to $1.60 per unit compared to $1.51 per unit in fiscal year 2009. Geographically, international revenues were $841.8 million or 72% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, an increase of $162.6 million as compared to international revenues of $679.2 million or 70% of revenues for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Internati onally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $465.6 million or 40% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $203.3 million or 17% of revenues and $172.9 million or 15% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $328.2 million or 28% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, an increase of $38.9 million over domestic revenues of $289.3 million or 30% of revenues in fiscal year 2009. Revenue for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 was $968.5 million, a decrease of $206.7 million or 18% from revenue of $1,175.2 million for fiscal year 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower domestic and international sales as a result of the global recession. The recession impacted all of the Companys major end markets, particularly the Companys automotive and cell phone end markets. The ASP for fiscal year 2009 decreased slightly to $1.51 per unit compared to $1.56 per unit in fiscal year 2008. Geographically, international revenues were $679.2 million or 70% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009, a decrease of $149.1 million as compared to international revenues of $828.3 million or 70% of revenues for fiscal year 2008. Internationally, sales to ROW represented $390.3 million or 40% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $166.9 million or 17% of revenues and $122.0 million or 13% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $289.3 million or 30% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009, a decrease of $57.5 million from domestic revenues of $346.8 million or 30% of revenues in fiscal year 2008. During the global economic downturn in fiscal year 2009 and the beginning of fiscal year 2010, the Company cut variable costs aggressively in order to maintain its strong operating margins while faced with steep revenue declines. These measures included weekly plant closures, mandatory vacation, reductions in base pay, reductions in profit sharing, modest employee terminations and reductions in non compensation related discretionary spending. The Company removed the above mentioned austerity measures throughout fiscal year 2010 as the Companys revenues improved. There were no factory closures during the second half of fiscal year 2010 and the 10% reduction in base pay that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was gradually reinstated during fiscal year 2010. Accordin gly, compensation and other costs increased in the cost of sales and operating expense line items, although to a lesser degree than revenues increased. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 was $900.9 million, an increase of $170.3 million or 23% over gross profit of $730.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 77% of revenues in fiscal year 2010 as compared to 75.4% of revenues in fiscal year 2009. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to spreading fixed costs over a higher sales base and slightly improved ASPs. Partially offsetting these improvements to gross profit as a percentage of revenues were increases in employee profit sharing and stock based compensation expense. 24 Gross profit for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 was $730.6 million, a decrease of $177.5 million or 20% from gross profit of $908.1 million in fiscal year 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 75.4% of revenues in fiscal year 2009 as compared to 77.3% of revenues in fiscal year 2008. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to spreading fixed costs over a lower sales base and inefficiencies resulting from temporary plant shutdowns. These decreases were partially offset by lower employee profit sharing and lower labor costs as a result of the temporary salary reduction and the reduction in workforce. Research and development (R&D) expense for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 was $199.0 million, an increase of $13.2 million or 7% over R&D expense of $185.8 million in fiscal year 2009. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in employee profit sharing and a $4.1 million increase in stock based compensation. In addition, the increase in R&D expense was due to a $0.7 million increase in compensation costs as a result of the gradual elimination of the above mentioned austerity measures. Offsetting these increases to R&D expense was a $0.8 million decrease in other R&D expenses such as mask costs. R&D expense for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 was $185.8 million, a decrease of $11.2 million or 6% over R&D expense of $197.1 million in fiscal year 2008. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to a $7.1 million decrease in employee profit sharing. In addition, compensation costs decreased $3.9 million as employees were required to take approximately 5.5 weeks of vacation or time off without pay during the fiscal year and due to the reductions in workforce that occurred during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2009. The decrease in R&D expense was also due to a $2.2 million decrease in other R&D expenses such as software and equipment maintenance fees. Partially offsetting these decreases to R&D expenses was a $2.0 million increase in stock based compensation exp ense. Selling general and administrative (SG&A) expense for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 was $138.5 million, an increase of $9.7 million or 8% over SG&A expense of $128.8 million in fiscal year 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in employee profit sharing and a $1.9 million increase in stock based compensation. In addition, the increase in SG&A expense was due to a $2.9 million increase in compensation costs as a result of the gradual elimination of the above mentioned austerity measures and an increase to the sales commission expense in response to higher sales. Offsetting these increases to SG&A expense was a $1.7 million decrease in other SG&A expenses such as legal and advertising costs. SG&A expense for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 was $128.8 million, a decrease of $13.6 million or 10% from SG&A expense of $142.4 million in fiscal year 2008. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $5.2 million decrease in employee profit sharing. In addition, compensation costs decreased $2.2 million as employees were required to take approximately 5.5 weeks of vacation or time off without pay during the fiscal year and due to reductions in workforce that occurred during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2009. Other SG&A expenses such as legal cost decreased $5.1 million as well as advertising costs which decreased $2.1 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $1.6 million increase in stock based compensation expense. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 was $75.4 million, a decrease of $7.6 million from $83.0 million in fiscal year 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the retirement of $294.4 million principal amount of the Companys 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes during fiscal year 2009 and partially due to the retirement of $154.9 million principal amount of the Companys 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 was $83.0 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from interest expense of $89.9 million in fiscal year 2008. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the purchase and retirement of $294.4 million face value of the Companys 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes during fiscal year 2009. Interest income for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $10.2 million or 44% from interest income of $23.0 million in fiscal year 2009. Interest income decreased due to a decrease in the average interest rate earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Interest income for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 was $23.0 million, a decrease of $7.1 million or 24% from interest income of $30.1 million in fiscal year 2008. Interest income decreased both due to a decrease in the average interest rate earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and a reduction in the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances due to the Company spending $270.1 million to purchase and retire $294.4 million face value of it 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes. The Companys effective tax rate was 26.3% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 21.6% in fiscal year 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from domestic manufacturing, R&D and tax exempt interest income offset partially by an increase in earnings from foreign subsidiaries with lower income tax rates. The Companys annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2010 was 27.5% exclusive of discrete items. Quarterly discrete items that lowered the effective tax rate to 26.3% included the reversal of income tax reserves for state audit settlements and the expiration of open auditable tax years in a foreign jurisdiction. The Companys estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011, e xcluding quarterly discrete tax items if any, is 27.5%. 25 The Companys effective tax rate was 21.6% in fiscal year 2009 compared to 27.9% in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009 the Companys annual effective tax rate was 27.5% exclusive of quarterly discrete items. The decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 is primarily the result of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit legislation during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and higher tax benefits for domestic manufacturing. The Companys tax rate also decreased due to quarterly discrete tax benefits related to an agreement with the IRS to effectively settle certain disputed extraterritorial income (ETI) export benefits claimed during fiscal years 2002 through 2006; prior year tax benefits realized in fiscal year 2009 r esulting from the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit; and prior year domestic manufacturing tax benefits. The Companys effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of lower tax rates on the earnings of its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, principally in Singapore and Malaysia. The Company has a partial tax holiday through July 2015 in Malaysia and a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2011 which the Company expects to extend if certain conditions are met. In addition, the Company receives tax benefits primarily from non taxable interest income, domestic manufacturing and R&D tax credits. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products; increases in costs associated with utilities, transportation and raw materials; currency fluctuations; the effects of adverse economic and financial conditions in the United States and throughout the world; and other factors described below and in Item 1A Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The Company achieved its second consecutive quarter of record quarterly revenues by growing 18% over the third quarter of fiscal 2010 while revenue for fiscal year 2010 grew 21% over the prior year. The Companys revenue growth has been broad based across all geographic regions and most end markets, most notably in the automotive, industrial and computer end markets. The Company believes that new programs at both new and existing customers as well as expanding end customer demand at continuing programs have been the primary catalyst for the current revenue growth. The Company has continued to closely manage expenses; as a result operating margin improved through out fiscal year 2010. The Companys book to bill ratio remained firmly positive and orders continue to be strong throug h the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. Although the first fiscal quarter is traditionally a slower growth quarter for the Company, the Company expects to grow revenues in the 4% to 7% range sequentially for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Estimates of future performance are uncertain, and past performance by the Company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the Company, its competitors, the semiconductor industry and the overall United States and worldwide economy. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, cyclical market patterns, periodic oversupply conditions, occasional shortages of materials, capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. Furthermore, new product introductions and patent protection of existing products, as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the Company, are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustain ed profitability. Although the Company believes that it has the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations, sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors. Additionally, the Companys common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Liquidity and Capital Resources At June 27, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $958.1 million an increase of $89.4 million over the June 28, 2009 balance. The increase was primarily due to positive cashflow from operations of $492.5 million offset by cash outflows of $164.0 million to purchase and retire $164.7 million face value of Convertible Senior Notes; $205.1 million for the payment of cash dividends, representing $0.90 per share for the fiscal year; $38.3 million for capital asset additions; and $14.7 million to purchase common stock. The Companys working capital was $681.8 million at June 27, 2010. The Companys accounts receivable balance of $176.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2010 increased $81.4 million over the balance at the end of fiscal year 2009. The increase is primarily due to higher shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. Inventory totaled $54.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, an increase of $1.5 million over the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. The increase in inventory was primarily due to increased capacity to support higher revenue levels. 26 Other non current assets decreased $4.5 million primarily due to the amortization of offering fees related to the Convertible Senior Notes and the amortization of certain technology licenses. Net property, plant and equipment decreased $1.4 million during fiscal year 2010. Additions totaled $38.3 million primarily due to the purchase of production equipment offset by depreciation of $39.7 million. Accrued payroll and related benefits totaled $80.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2010, an increase of $36.5 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. The increase is primarily due to an increase to the Companys profit sharing accrual. The Company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased by $5.2 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 primarily due to distributors increasing their inventories in response to the economic recovery. Income taxes payable totaled $19.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2010, an increase of $9.9 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 primarily due to an increase in the C ompanys tax provision offset by quarterly tax payments. In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share. The $0.23 per share dividend will be paid on August 25, 2010 to stockholders of record on August 13, 2010. The payment of future dividends will be based on financial performance. Historically, the Company has satisfied its quarterly liquidity needs through cash generated from operations. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity, capital expenditures requirements, and debt retirement for the foreseeable future. The Company presently intends to use a portion of its cash and marketable securities to redeem the remaining outstanding $395.8 million principal amount of the 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes in November 2010 when they become puttable and callable. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations at June 27, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future periods. (In thousands) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2015 and thereafter Operating lease obligations (1) $ 2,600 $ 1,500 $ 900 $ 600 $ 2,000 3.0% convertible debentures principal and interest (2) 25,353 25,353 25,353 870,441 3.125% convertible debentures principal and interest (3) 402,013 Total $ 429,966 $ 26,853 $ 26,253 $ 871,041 $ 2,000 (1) The Company leases some of its facilities under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2057.

The Company pays cash interest at an annual rate of 3.0% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. The Company has purchased and retired $154.9 million face value of the 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes. The Company may redeem the remaining outstanding $845.1 million principal amount of the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes for cash at any time on or after May 1, 2014, and holders may require the Company to repurchase the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes for cash on specified dates or upon a fundamental change. (3) In April 2007, the Company issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. The Company pays cash interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. The Company has purchased and retired $304.2 million face value of the 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes. The Company may redeem the remaining outstanding $395.8 million principal amount of the 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes for cash at any time on or after November 1, 2010, and holders may require the Company to repurchase the 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes for cash on specified dates or upon a fundamental change. The Company presently intends to redeem the remaining outstanding $395.8 million principal on November 1, 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 27, 2010, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. 27 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at June 27, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investme nts totaling approximately $3.8 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity.
