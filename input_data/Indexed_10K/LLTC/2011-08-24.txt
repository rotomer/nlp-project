ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverviewLinear Technology Corporation, a member of the S&P 500, has been designing, manufacturing and marketing a broad line of high performance analog integrated circuits for major companies worldwide for three decades. The Companys products provide an essential bridge between the analog world and the digital electronics used in industrial, communications, networking, automotive, computer, medical, instrumentation, military, aerospace, and consumer end markets. Linear Technology produces power management, data conversion, signal conditioning, RF and interface ICs, and Module subsystems. Fourth quarter revenues of $358.6 million increased $5.4 million or 1.5% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and decreased $7.6 million or 2.1% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Company achieved record annual revenues in fiscal year 2011 of $1.48 billion, an increase of 27% or $314.0 million over fiscal year 2010. Fourth quarter net income of $158.2 million increased $16.7 million or 12% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $33.7 million or 27% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 benefited from a lower tax rate of 9.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 rate of 17% and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 rate of 26%. The Companys tax rate in its fiscal third and fourth quarters just ended include a quarterly tax benefit from a settlement with the IRS related to its audit of prior fiscal years. The resulting fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.68 per share increased $0.07 per share or 11% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $0.14 per share or 26% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Company achieved record annual diluted earnings per share of $2.50, an increase of $0.92 per share or 58% over the prior fiscal year. Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, including those related to inventory valuation, revenue recognition and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities.The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. During fiscal years 232011 and 2010, the Company recognized approximately 14% and 15%, respectively, of net revenues from domestic distributors that are recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of pricing rebates, the ultimate sales price on domestic distributor sales transactions is not fixed or determinable until domestic distributors sell the merchandise to the end user. At the time of shipment to domestic distributors, the Company records a trade receivable and deferred revenue at the distributor purchasing price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay for the products delivered. The Company relieves inventory as title has passed to the distributor and recognizes deferred cost of sales in the same amount. Deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the difference between deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales and is recognized as a current liability until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer. At July 3, 2011, the Company had approximately $59.7 million of deferred revenue and $12.1 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as $47.6 million of Deferred income on shipments to distributors. At June 27, 2010, the Company had approximately $41.6 million of deferred revenue and $7.9 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as $33.7 million of Deferred income on shipments to distributors. The Company believes that its deferred costs of revenues have limited risk of material impairment, as the Company offers stock rotation privileges to distributors (up to 3% to 5% of quarterly purchases) which enable distributors to rotate slow moving inventory. In addition, stock rotated inventory that is returned to the Company is generally resalable. The Company reviews distributor ending on hand inventory balances, as well as orders placed on the Company to ensure that distributors are not overstocking parts and are ordering to forecasted demand. To the extent the Company were to have a significant reduction in distributor price or grant significant price rebates, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross profit recognized. The price rebates that have been remitted back to distributors have ranged from $2.4 million to $3.2 million per quarter.The Companys sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. Revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes. The Company has reserves to cover expected product returns. If product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations, the Company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns. Generally, changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin.Inventory ValuationThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. The Company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable, excess or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors. The Company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand. The Company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate. In addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts, judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability, obsolescence, historical experience and current business conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin.Income TaxesThe Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period.The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the authoritative accounting literature. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company has to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of current tax matters.24Results of OperationsThe table below presents the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount.

The increase in revenue was primarily due to an improving global macro economic climate during the first half of fiscal 2011. In addition, the beginning of the prior fiscal year was adversely impacted by the worldwide global credit and financial crisis, whereas the results for the second half of the prior fiscal year and the first half of the current fiscal year reflected a recovery from the worldwide recession. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2011 the Company began to see a slow down in revenue growth primarily related to the natural disasters in Japan and the related supply disruptions and the general economic sluggishness related to the US and European debt issues.Revenue for fiscal year 2011 grew due to an increase in the number of units shipped and due to an increase in the average selling price ("ASP"). The number of units shipped increased by approximately 132 million units or 18% from 730 million units in fiscal year 2010 to 862 million units in fiscal year 2011. The ASP for fiscal year 2011 increased approximately 9% from $1.60 per unit in fiscal year 2010 to $1.74 per unit in fiscal year 2011. Over the past few years the Company has been reducing its exposure to the consumer and cell phone end markets in favor of the industrial, automotive, communication infrastructure and military end markets because these latter end markets tend to demand more complex technology products, which have higher and more stable ASPs. The Companys bookings in the industrial, automotive, communication infrastructure, and military end markets were 82% of booking for fiscal year 2011 as compared to 76% in fiscal 2010, 74% in fiscal 2009 and 64% in fiscal 2005. Geographically, revenues in fiscal year 2011 increased in each major geographical region compared to the prior fiscal year. International revenues were $1,078.2 million or 73% of revenues in fiscal year 2011, an increase of $236.4 million over international revenues of $841.8 million or 72% of revenues in the previous fiscal year. Internationally, sales to Rest of the World (ROW), which is primarily Asia excluding Japan, represented $565.6 million or 38% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $297.1 million or 20% of revenues and $215.5 million or 15% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $405.7 million or 27% of revenues in fiscal year 2011, an increase of $77.5 million over domestic revenues of $328.2 million or 28% of revenues in fiscal year 2010.Revenue for fiscal year 2010 was $1.17 billion, an increase of $201.5 million or 21% over revenue of $968.5 million for fiscal year 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the rapid recovery in 2010 from the preceding global economic downturn. The Companys revenues improved in each major geographical region and in most major end markets. The ASP for 25fiscal year 2010 increased to $1.60 per unit compared to $1.51 per unit in fiscal year 2009. Geographically, international revenues were $841.8 million or 72% of revenues for fiscal year 2010, an increase of $162.6 million as compared to international revenues of $679.2 million or 70% of revenues in the previous fiscal year. Internationally, sales to ROW represented $465.6 million or 40% of revenues, while sales to Europe and Japan were $203.3 million or 17% of revenues and $172.9 million or 15% of revenues, respectively. Domestic revenues were $328.2 million or 28% of revenues in fiscal year 2010, an increase of $38.9 million over domestic revenues of $289.3 million or 30% of revenues in fiscal year 2009. During the global economic downturn in fiscal year 2009 and the beginning of fiscal year 2010, the Company cut variable costs aggressively in order to maintain its strong operating margins while faced with steep revenue declines. These measures included weekly plant closures, mandatory vacation, reductions in base pay, reductions in profit sharing, modest employee terminations and reductions in non compensation related discretionary spending. The Company removed the above mentioned austerity measures throughout fiscal year 2010 as the Companys revenues improved. There were no weekly plant closures during the second half of fiscal year 2010 and the 10% reduction in base pay that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was gradually reinstated during fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2011 there were no weekly plant closures and the Companys pay freeze was lifted. Accordingly, compensation and other costs increased in the cost of sales and operating expense line items, although to a lesser degree than revenues increased.Gross profit for fiscal year 2011 was $1,159.5 million, an increase of $258.6 million or 29% over gross profit of $900.9 million in fiscal year 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 78.1% of revenues in fiscal year 2011 as compared to 77.0% of revenues in fiscal year 2010. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to spreading fixed costs over a higher sales base and improved ASPs. Partially offsetting these improvements to gross profit as a percentage of revenues were increases in employee profit sharing; increases in labor costs as a result of increases in headcount; an unfavorable exchange rate at the Companys test and assembly facilities located in Singapore and Penang; and increases in raw material costs, primarily gold. Gross profit for fiscal year 2010 was $900.9 million, an increase of $170.3 million or 23% over gross profit of $730.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 77% of revenues in fiscal year 2010 as compared to 75.4% of revenues in fiscal year 2009. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to spreading fixed costs over a higher sales base and slightly improved ASPs. Partially offsetting these improvements to gross profit as a percentage of revenues were increases in employee profit sharing and stock based compensation expense. Research and development (R&D) expense for fiscal year 2011 was $226.5 million, an increase of $27.6 million or 14% over R&D expense of $199.0 million in fiscal year 2010. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to an $11.7 million increase in employee profit sharing and a $13.3 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs increased due to increased headcount; the prior year period having a temporary 5% reduction in base pay for part of the period; and the current year period having an additional week of labor costs due to the period having 27 pay periods rather than the customary 26 pay periods. In addition, other R&D expenses such as computer and software costs and employee travel expenses increased $2.6 million. R&D expense for fiscal year 2010 was $199.0 million, an increase of $13.2 million or 7% over R&D expense of $185.8 million in fiscal year 2009. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in employee profit sharing and a $4.1 million increase in stock based compensation. In addition, the increase in R&D expense was due to a $0.7 million increase in compensation costs as a result of the gradual elimination of the above mentioned austerity measures. Offsetting these increases to R&D expense was a $0.8 million decrease in other R&D expenses such as mask costs.Selling general and administrative (SG&A) expense for fiscal year 2011 was $165.7 million, an increase of $27.1 million or 20% over SG&A expense of $138.5 million in fiscal year 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $9.0 million increase in employee profit sharing and a $7.4 million increase in compensation costs. Compensation costs increased due to increased headcount; the prior year period having a temporary 5% reduction in base pay for part of the period; and the current year period having an additional week of labor costs due to the period having 27 pay periods rather than the customary 26 pay periods. SG&A increased $5.3 million due to a one time legal charge that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and a $5.4 million increase in other SG&A expenses, primarily advertising and employee travel expenses. SG&A expense for fiscal year 2010 was $138.5 million, an increase of $9.7 million or 8% over SG&A expense of $128.8 million in fiscal year 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in employee profit sharing and a $1.9 million increase in stock based compensation. In addition, the increase in SG&A expense was due to a $2.9 million increase in compensation costs as a result of the gradual elimination of the above mentioned austerity measures and an increase to the sales commission expense in response to higher sales. Offsetting these increases to SG&A expense was a $1.7 million decrease in other SG&A expenses such as legal and advertising costs.26Interest expense for fiscal year 2011 was $54.2 million, a decrease of $21.2 million from $75.4 million in fiscal year 2010. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the cash redemption of $395.8 million (the remaining principal amount) of the Companys 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes on November 1, 2010 and due to the repurchase of $154.9 million (principal amount) of the Companys 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Interest expense for fiscal year 2010 was $75.4 million, a decrease of $7.6 million from $83.0 million in fiscal year 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the retirement of $294.4 million principal amount of the Companys 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes during fiscal year 2009 and partially due to the retirement of $154.9 million principal amount of the Companys 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Interest and other income for fiscal year 2011 was $10.7 million, a decrease of $2.1 million or 16% from interest income of $12.8 million in fiscal year 2010. The Company recognized a gain of $4.2 million on the settlement of two legal matters during fiscal year 2011 that was included in interest and other income. Interest income decreased due to lower cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as a result of the cash redemption of $395.8 million (principal amount) of the Companys 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 and a decrease in the average interest rate earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Interest and other income for fiscal year 2010 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $10.2 million or 44% from interest income of $23.0 million in fiscal year 2009. Interest income decreased due to a decrease in the average interest rate earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.The Companys effective tax rate was 19.8% in fiscal year 2011 compared to 26.3% in fiscal year 2010. The Companys tax rate for fiscal year 2011 was lower primarily due to discrete tax benefits recognized in the second, third and fourth quarters noted below and the reinstatement of the R&D credit for the full fiscal year commencing with the second quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company expects that its effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will be approximately 26% absent quarterly discrete tax items, if any.During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 the Company and the Appeals Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS Appeals) reached an agreement to close all remaining matters pertaining to fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Accordingly, the Company released all remaining liabilities for uncertain tax positions pertaining to fiscal year 2002 through 2006 and recognized a discrete tax benefit totaling $29.7 million primarily due to the reversal of conservatively estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions. As a result of the discrete tax benefit, the Companys effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 was 9.5%. In addition to the discrete tax benefit recognized in the Companys fourth quarter noted above, the Company recognized an additional $19 million in net discrete tax benefits during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011. These discrete tax benefits related primarily to the release of estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to a settlement between the Company and IRS Appeals for certain disputed refund claims for export tax benefits the Company claimed as its extraterritorial income (ETI) exclusion under the Internal Revenue Code for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. In addition, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits for the reversal of estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions for years that are no longer subject to audit and for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. The Companys effective tax rate was 26.3% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 21.6% in fiscal year 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from domestic manufacturing, R&D and tax exempt interest income offset partially by an increase in earnings from foreign subsidiaries with lower income tax rates. The Companys annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2010 was 27.5% exclusive of discrete items. Quarterly discrete items that lowered the effective tax rate to 26.3% included the reversal of income tax reserves for state audit settlements and the expiration of open auditable tax years in a foreign jurisdiction. The Companys effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% as a result of lower tax rates on the earnings of its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, principally in Singapore and Malaysia. The Company has a partial tax holiday through July 2015 in Malaysia and a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2011 which the Company expects to extend if certain conditions are met. In addition, the Company receives tax benefits primarily from non taxable interest income, domestic manufacturing and R&D tax credits.Factors Affecting Future Operating ResultsExcept for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including 27the statements in the following paragraphs, are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp up of new facilities, the timely introduction of new processes and products; increases in costs associated with utilities, transportation and raw materials; currency fluctuations; the effects of adverse economic and financial conditions in the United States and throughout the world; and other factors described below and in Item 1A Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.The Companys revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 grew 1.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. During the fourth quarter the Company experienced declining bookings demand towards the end of the quarter. The Company expected that the Japan tragedies and the related supply disruptions would continue to impact the Companys customers, particularly in the automotive and industrial markets. Now that these industry wide supply issues have been largely resolved the Companys customers have been reducing their inventories more than anticipated. The impact of these events and general economic sluggishness relating to US and European debt issues appear to have left customers cautious and delaying orders until the current economic picture becomes clearer. However, end demand expectations at the Companys customers appear generally unchanged and automotive production is expected to pick up in the fall.The Company continues to be optimistic about its long term growth prospects and is encouraged by the high level of interest in its new products. The Company believes that its new products are well targeted to meet the needs of its customers and their demand for innovative high performance analog solutions. Although forecasting is difficult in the current environment, the Company expects demand should increase as it proceeds toward the end of the calendar year. However, in the short term the Company is cautious and anticipates that declining orders will cause the Companys revenues to decline sequentially 6% 8% in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2012. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt July 3, 2011, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $922.5 million a decrease of $35.5 million from the June 27, 2010 balance. The decrease was primarily due to the cash redemption of $395.8 million (principal amount) of its 2027B notes on November 1, 2010. In addition, the decrease was due to the payment of $217.2 million in cash dividends, representing $0.94 per share for the fiscal year; $120.4 million for capital asset additions; and $38.2 million to purchase common stock. Theses decreases were offset by positive cashflow from operations of $670.9 million and issuance of common stock of $66.9 million. The Companys working capital was $1,063.5 million at July 3, 2011.The Companys accounts receivable balance of $169.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2011 decreased $7.3 million from the June 27, 2010 balance of $176.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Inventory totaled $72.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, an increase of $18.2 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The increase in inventory was primarily in the diebank and finished good areas resulting from increased production capacity employed to reduce lead times and also due to higher stocking levels of certain raw materials that were previously in short supply.Net property, plant and equipment increased $75.9 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 due to fixed assets additions of $120.4 million offset by $44.5 million in depreciation expense. The additions were for equipment in all of the Companys facilities to increase capacity to reduce lead times.Other non current assets decreased $17.5 million primarily due to the amortization of offering fees related to the Convertible Senior Notes and the amortization of certain technology licenses and a decrease in the Companys long term deferred tax assets. Accrued payroll and related benefits totaled $90.0 million at the end of fiscal year 2011, an increase of $9.2 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The increase is due to higher vacation, sabbatical and profit sharing accruals. The Company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased by $13.9 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 primarily due to distributors increasing their inventories in response to the economic recovery. Income taxes payable totaled $5.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $14.4 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 primarily due to quarterly tax payments offset by the tax provision.In July 2011, the Companys Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share. The $0.24 per share dividend will be paid on August 31, 2011 to stockholders of record on August 19, 2011. The payment of future dividends will be based on 28financial performance.During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company redeemed for cash the remaining $395.8 million (principal amount) of its Companys 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes on November 1, 2010 using a portion of its existing cash and marketable securities balances. The redemption of debt did not result in any gains or losses in the statement of income. Fiscal year 2011 had lower interest income and expense as a result of the redemption.Historically, the Company has satisfied its quarterly liquidity needs through cash generated from operations. Given its strong financial condition and performance, the Company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity, capital expenditures requirements, and debt retirement for the foreseeable future. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes the Companys significant contractual obligations at July 3, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future periods.(In thousands)Fiscal 2012Fiscal 2013Fiscal 2014Fiscal 2015Fiscal 2016 and thereafterOperating lease obligations (1)$2,500$1,900$1,200$600$1,8003.0% Convertible Senior Notes principal and interest (2)25,35325,353870,441Total$27,853$27,253$871,641$600$1,800(1)The Company leases some of its facilities under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2057. See Note 11. of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement contained in this Form 10 K for additional information about operating leases.(2)In April 2007, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. The Company pays cash interest at an annual rate of 3.0% payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. The Company has purchased and retired $154.9 million face value of the 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes. The Company may redeem the remaining outstanding $845.1 million principal amount of the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes for cash at any time on or after May 1, 2014, and holders may require the Company to repurchase the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes for cash on specified dates or upon a fundamental change.29Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of July 3, 2011, the Company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. The Companys investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the Company. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the Companys investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Based upon the weighted average duration of the Companys investments at July 3, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the Companys investments totaling approximately $5.8 million. However, because the Companys debt securities are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized by the Company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders deficit. The Company generally holds securities until maturity. The Companys sales outside the United States are transacted in U.S. dollars; accordingly, the Companys sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes.30
