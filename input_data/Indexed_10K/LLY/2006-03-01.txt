Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Executive Overview This section provides an overview of our financial results, product launches and late stage product pipeline developments, and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent, due in part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets. In addition, we launched one new product in the U.S. and several new products, new indications, or new formulations in key markets in 2005. We continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite product launch expenditures, our cost containment and productivity measures 18 Table of Contents contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales. During 2005, we began to expense stock options, which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses. We also benefited from an increase in net other income due primarily to increased profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005. Net income was $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005 as compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 9 percent. Net income comparisons between 2005 and 2004 are also affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results (see Notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2005 We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters, primarily related to Zyprexa, of $1.07 billion (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the second quarter of 2005 (Notes 4 and 13). In 2005, we began to expense stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Had we expensed stock options in 2004, our 2004 net income would have been lower by $266.4 million, which would have decreased earnings per share by $.24 per share (Notes 1 and 7). We recognized asset impairment and other special charges of $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4). We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million (after tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02 (Note 2). 19 Table of Contents 2004 We recognized asset impairment charges, streamlined our infrastructure, and provided for the anticipated resolution of the government investigation of Evista marketing and promotional practices, resulting in charges of $108.9 million (pretax) in the second quarter and $494.1 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.08 and $.30, respectively (Note 4). We incurred charges for acquired in process research and development (IPR&D) of $362.3 million (no tax benefit) in the first quarter related to the acquisition of Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. (AME), and $29.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter related to our acquisition of a Phase I compound currently under development as a potential treatment for insomnia, which decreased earnings per share by $.33 in the first quarter and $.02 in the fourth quarter (Note 3). As discussed further in Financial Condition, we recognized tax expenses of $465.0 million in the fourth quarter associated with the anticipated repatriation in 2005 of $8.00 billion of our earnings reinvested outside the U.S., as a result of the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This tax expense decreased earnings per share by $.43 in that quarter (Note 11). Recent Product Launches and Late Stage Product Pipeline Developments Our long term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and late stage pipeline developments, including: We are in the process of rolling out the global launches of a number of new products, including Alimta, Byetta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Forteo, Strattera, Symbyax, and Yentreve. In addition, we recently launched new indications or formulations of Alimta, Cymbalta, Gemzar, Humatrope, and Zyprexa. We launched Cymbalta for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the U.S. in August 2004. In September 2004, Cymbalta received its second U.S. approval and became the first FDA approved treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). Cymbalta was launched in the United Kingdom and Germany in the first quarter of 2005 for the treatment of major depressive episodes. Other launches in the European Union are expected to occur throughout 2006. The European Commission also granted marketing authorization of Cymbalta for the treatment of DPNP in adults in July 2005. Cymbalta has achieved $728.9 million in U.S. sales since its launch. In June 2005, Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., launched Byetta (exenatide), the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics, in the U.S. for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we submitted Byetta for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Europe. We expect to advance our pipeline during 2006 with three significant submissions anticipated, including Arxxanttm for diabetic retinopathy, Cymbalta for generalized anxiety disorder, and Evista for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women. 20 Table of Contents Legal and Governmental Matters Certain generic manufacturers have challenged our U.S. compound patent for Zyprexa and are seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa prior to its patent expiration in 2011. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis ruled in our favor on all counts, upholding our patents. The decision has been appealed. In 2005, we entered into an agreement with plaintiffs attorneys involved in certain U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims against us relating to the medication. We established a fund of $690 million for the claimants who agree to settle their claims. Additionally, we paid $10 million to cover administration of the settlement. As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial majority of which were related to Zyprexa, we recorded a net pretax charge of $1.07 billion in the second quarter of 2005. In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorneys office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that it has commenced a civil investigation relating to our U.S. sales, marketing, and promotional practices. In the United States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which provides a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, took effect January 1, 2006. While it is difficult to predict the business impact of this legislation, we currently anticipate a modest short term increase in sales. However, in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures. While the MMA prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers, we expect continued challenges to that prohibition over the next several years. Also, the MMA retains the authority of the Secretary of HHS to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs, but we expect Congress to consider several measures that could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the U.S. regardless of their safety or cost. If adopted, such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our U.S. sales. We believe there is some chance that the new and expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the MMA will alleviate the need for a federal importation scheme. As a result of the passage of the MMA, aged and disabled patients jointly eligible for Medicare and Medicaid began receiving their prescription drug benefits through the Medicare program, instead of Medicaid, on January 1, 2006. This may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level. A majority of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their Medicaid programs, and these programs are expected to continue in the post MMA environment. Several states are also attempting to extend discounted Medicaid prices to non Medicaid patients. Additionally, notwithstanding the federal law prohibiting drug importation, approximately a dozen states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens, usually involving a website that links patients to selected Canadian pharmacies. One state has such a program for its state employees. As a result, we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue. International operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. 21 Table of Contents Operating Results 2005 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent, to $14.65 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, Forteo, and Gemzar. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately $170 million. Sales growth in 2005 was also affected by decreased U.S. demand for Zyprexa, Strattera, and Prozac. Despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand, sales in the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $7.80 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $6.85 billion, driven by growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 3 percent, with global selling prices contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2005 compared with 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2005 Year Ended Percent December 31, 2004 Change Product U.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total from 2004 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,034.9 $ 2,167.4 $ 4,202.3 $ 4,419.8 (5 ) Gemzar 586.1 748.4 1,334.5 1,214.4 10 Humalog 739.6 458.1 1,197.7 1,101.6 9 Evista 652.9 383.2 1,036.1 1,012.7 2 Humulin 410.7 594.0 1,004.7 997.7 1 Animal health products 370.3 493.4 863.7 798.7 8 Cymbalta 636.2 43.5 679.7 93.9 NM Strattera 498.7 53.4 552.1 666.7 (17 ) Actos 355.7 137.3 493.0 452.9 9 Alimta 296.3 166.9 463.2 142.6 NM Fluoxetine products 249.1 204.3 453.4 559.0 (19 ) Anti infectives 133.3 310.6 443.9 478.0 (7 ) Humatrope 184.5 229.9 414.4 430.3 (4 ) Forteo 264.7 124.6 389.3 238.6 63 ReoPro 119.8 176.9 296.7 362.8 (18 ) Xigris 118.9 95.7 214.6 201.8 6 Cialis(2) 2.3 167.6 169.9 130.6 30 Symbyax 52.6 1.3 53.9 70.2 (23 ) Other pharmaceutical products 91.5 290.7 382.2 485.6 (21 ) Total net sales $ 7,798.1 $ 6,847.2 $ 14,645.3 $ 13,857.9 6 NM Not meaningful (1) U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. (2) Cialis had worldwide 2005 sales of $746.6 million, representing an increase of 35 percent compared with 2004. The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses, is reported in net other income in our consolidated income statement. 22 Table of Contents Zyprexa, our top selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 16 percent in 2005, resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures. Sales outside the U.S. in 2005 increased 9 percent, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased by 6 percent. In September 2005, the National Institute of Mental Health released the results of its Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study, which showed that Zyprexa was statistically superior on time to discontinuation in patients with schizophrenia as compared to other medications. Patients taking Zyprexa also experienced significantly fewer hospitalizations for schizophrenia than patients taking other medications. In addition, the study noted that Zyprexa patients experienced greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism than patients using other antipsychotics. Diabetes care products, composed primarily of Humalog, our insulin analog; Humulin, a biosynthetic human insulin; Actos, an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; and recently launched Byetta, the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin Pharmaceuticals, had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.80 billion in 2005, an increase of 7 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $1.59 billion, primarily driven by higher prices, offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.20 billion. Humalog sales increased 8 percent in the U.S. and 10 percent outside the U.S. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 3 percent, while Humulin sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent. Actos revenues, the majority of which represent service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda), increased 9 percent in 2005. Actos is manufactured by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos expire in September 2006; however, we will continue receiving royalties from Takeda. As a result, our revenues from Actos will decline each year from 2006 through 2009. Our arrangement in the U.S. ceases after October 2009. Sales of Byetta were $74.6 million following its June 2005 launch. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byettas gross margin and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. This revenue totaled $39.6 million in 2005. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S. Sales growth in the U.S. in 2005 was negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Gemzar sales increased 15 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications. 23 Table of Contents Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, decreased 2 percent in the U.S. due to a decline in U.S. underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels. This decline was partially offset by price increases. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista increased 11 percent, driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan. Cymbalta was launched in the U.S. in late August 2004 for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in September 2004 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Cymbalta launches began in Europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005, with additional launches expected through 2006. Cymbalta has been well accepted, generating $679.7 million in sales in 2005. Sales of Strattera, the only nonstimulant medicine approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, declined 24 percent in the U.S. in 2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $53.4 million in 2005, compared with $10.3 million in 2004, primarily reflecting recent launches in Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Spain. In the third quarter of 2005, we announced an important update to the Strattera label, communicating new information regarding uncommon reports of suicidal thoughts among children and adolescents. We have added a boxed warning to the label in the U.S. and are working with other regulatory agencies in countries where Strattera is approved to update the label information appropriately. Alimta was launched in the U.S. in February 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in August for second line treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alimta was launched in several European countries in the second half of 2004 and throughout 2005. Alimta generated sales of $463.2 million in 2005. 24 Table of Contents Forteo, a treatment for both men and postmenopausal women suffering from severe osteoporosis, increased 34 percent in the U.S. in 2005, driven by strong growth in underlying demand. Sales growth was offset, in part, by wholesaler destocking in the first half of 2005 related to our new arrangements with U.S. wholesalers. Cialis, an erectile dysfunction treatment, is promoted in North America and Europe jointly by Lilly and ICOS Corporation, and by Lilly exclusively in the rest of the world. The $746.6 million of worldwide Cialis sales in 2005, an increase of 35 percent compared to 2004, comprises $169.9 million of sales in our territories, which are reported in our net sales, and $576.7 million of sales in the joint venture territories. Within the joint venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis were $272.9 million for 2005, an increase of 32 percent, despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Cialis continues to increase its market share in most major markets in this extremely competitive category. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, led by Rumensin and Paylean. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2005 gross margin decreased to 76.3 percent of sales compared with 76.7 percent for 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses. Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses) increased 8 percent in 2005. Investment in research and development increased 12 percent, to $3.03 billion, in 2005, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing 25 Table of Contents approximately 21 percent of our sales into research and development during 2005. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005, to $4.50 billion, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. This comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Research and development expenses would have increased by 8 percent, and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005, if 2004 had been restated as if stock options had been expensed. Net other income for 2005 increased $89.4 million, to $419.4 million, primarily due to the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture becoming profitable during 2005 and increased interest income, partially offset by less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development. We report our 50 percent share of the operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture in our net other income. For 2005, our net income from the joint venture was $11.1 million, compared with a net loss of $79.0 million in 2004. The joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of 2005. Interest expense for 2005 increased $53.6 million, to $105.2 million, primarily due to an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 26.3 percent, compared with 38.5 percent for 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005 was affected by the product liability charge of $1.07 billion. The tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. The effective tax rate for 2004 was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Operating Results 2004 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 10 percent, due in part to the launch during the year of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets. We continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, resulting in costs of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite significant product launch expenditures, our cost containment and productivity measures resulted in marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate significantly less than sales. We also benefited from an increase in net other income in 2004. Net income was $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004, as compared with $2.56 billion, or $2.37 per share, in 2003, decreases of 29 and 30 percent, respectively. Certain items, reflected in our operating results for 2004 and 2003, should be considered in comparing the two years. The significant items for 2004 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2003 items are summarized as follows (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). We recognized asset impairments, primarily relating to manufacturing assets in the U.S., and streamlined our infrastructure, resulting in severance related and other charges totaling $167.1 million (pretax) in the first quarter and $28.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by approximately $.10 and $.02 in the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively (Note 4). Separately, we recognized asset impairments and other charges of $186.8 million (pretax) in the first quarter of 2003 related primarily to our common stock ownership and loan agreements with Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Isis), which decreased earnings per share by $.13 in that quarter (Note 4). In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a gain of $65.0 million (pretax) related to the sale of patent rights to dapoxetine for development in the field of genitourinary disorders to PPD, Inc., which increased earnings per share by $.04 in that quarter. Sales Our worldwide sales for 2004 increased 10 percent, to $13.86 billion, due primarily to the increased global sales of Strattera, Gemzar, Forteo, Zyprexa, Evista, Humatrope, and Cialis, and sales related to the launches of Alimta and Cymbalta. Sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent, to $7.67 billion. Sales outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, to $6.19 billion. Worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 5 percent, with global selling prices contributing 2 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 3 percent. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2004 compared with 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Year Ended Percent December 31, 2003 Change Product U.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total from 2003 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,422.2 $ 1,997.6 $ 4,419.8 $ 4,276.9 3 Gemzar 565.1 649.3 1,214.4 1,021.7 19 Humalog 685.4 416.2 1,101.6 1,021.3 8 Evista 667.9 344.8 1,012.7 922.1 10 Humulin 422.7 575.0 997.7 1,060.4 (6 ) Animal health products 338.9 459.8 798.7 726.6 10 Strattera 656.4 10.3 666.7 370.3 80 Fluoxetine products 327.3 231.7 559.0 645.1 (13 ) Anti infectives 110.2 367.8 478.0 489.9 (2 ) Actos 340.4 112.5 452.9 431.2 5 Humatrope 204.8 225.5 430.3 370.9 16 ReoPro 175.4 187.4 362.8 364.4 0 Forteo 198.0 40.6 238.6 65.3 NM Xigris 123.3 78.5 201.8 160.4 26 Alimta 121.8 20.8 142.6 NM Cialis(2) 1.4 129.2 130.6 73.5 78 Cymbalta 92.7 1.2 93.9 NM Symbyax 70.1 0.1 70.2 NM Other pharmaceutical products 144.5 341.1 485.6 582.5 (17 ) Total net sales $ 7,668.5 $ 6,189.4 $ 13,857.9 $ 12,582.5 10 NM Not meaningful (1) U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. (2) Cialis had worldwide 2004 sales of $552.3 million, an increase of 172 percent compared with 2003. The sales shown in the tables above represent results in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses, is reported in net other income in our consolidated income statement. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 8 percent in 2004 due to a decline in underlying demand from continued competitive pressures. Zyprexa sales outside the U.S. increased 22 percent, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets outside the U.S. International Zyprexa sales growth also benefited from the impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased 13 percent in 2004. Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.61 billion in 2004, an increase of 2 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. decreased 6 percent, to $1.49 billion. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 14 percent, to $1.12 billion. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 19 percent, driven primarily by volume declines due to competitive pressures. Humulin sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent. Humalog sales in the U.S. increased 3 percent as increased prices offset slight volume declines. Humalog sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, to $416.2 million. Actos revenues increased 5 percent in 2004. Sales of Gemzar increased 8 percent in the U.S. largely due to the May 2004 approval for the treatment of late stage metastatic breast cancer. Gemzar sales increased 31 percent outside the U.S., 28 Table of Contents driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista increased 1 percent in the U.S. due to continued competitive pressures. Outside the U.S., Evista maintained a strong growth rate of 32 percent, driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan. In 2004, Strattera generated an 80 percent increase over 2003 sales despite a very competitive landscape. In December 2004, we added a bolded warning to the product label, which indicates that the medication should be discontinued in patients with jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes) or in the event of laboratory evidence of liver injury. Forteo generated $238.6 million in sales in 2004, continuing the products strong growth trajectory following its U.S. launch in December 2002 and European launches in late 2003 and during 2004. The $552.3 million of worldwide Cialis sales in 2004, an increase of 172 percent compared to 2003, comprises $130.6 million of sales in our territories, which are reported in our net sales, and $421.7 million of sales in the joint venture territories. Within the joint venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis were $206.6 million for 2004. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, led by Tylan, Rumensin, and Paylean. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2004 gross margin decreased to 76.7 percent of sales compared with 78.7 percent for 2003. The decrease was due primarily to continued investment in our manufacturing technical capabilities and capacity and the impact of foreign exchange rates, offset partially by favorable changes in product mix due to growth in sales of higher margin products. Operating expenses increased 9 percent in 2004. Investment in research and development increased 15 percent, to $2.69 billion, due to increased clinical trial and development expenses and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by reimbursements for research activities from our collaboration partners. We reinvested more than 19 percent of our sales into research and development. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 6 percent in 2004, to $4.28 billion, attributable primarily to increased selling expenses in support of the new and anticipated product launches, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, increased charitable contributions to the Lilly Foundation, and increased product liability expenses, offset partially by ongoing marketing cost containment measures and marketing expense reimbursement from collaboration partners. A majority of the reimbursements are ongoing. Net other income for 2004 increased $126.9 million to $330.0 million. The increase for 2004 was primarily due to income related to the outlicensing of legacy products outside the United States, milestone payments from collaborations on the duloxetine molecule, income related to a previously assigned patent arrangement of $30.0 million, and other miscellaneous income. This was offset partially by an increase in the net loss of the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture, due primarily to increased marketing costs of Cialis in joint venture territories, and the 2003 sale of dapoxetine patent rights. For 2004, our net loss from the joint venture was $79.0 million, compared with $52.4 million in 2003. The effective tax rate for 2004 was 38.5 percent, compared with 21.5 percent for 2003. The increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation 29 Table of Contents of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $5.04 billion compared with $7.46 billion at December 31, 2004. Cash flow from operations of $1.91 billion and net issuances of long term debt of $2.00 billion were more than offset by net repayments of short term debt of $1.99 billion, dividends paid of $1.65 billion, capital expenditures of $1.30 billion, net purchases of noncurrent investments of $638.0 million, and repurchases of common stock of $377.9 million. Capital expenditures of $1.30 billion during 2005 were $600.0 million less than in 2004, due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects. We expect near term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2005 levels while we continue to invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care and other products, as well as research and development activities. Total debt at December 31, 2005, was $6.50 billion, essentially unchanged compared to December 31, 2004. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys remain at AA and Aa3, respectively. Dividends of $1.52 per share were paid in 2005, an increase of 7 percent from 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, effective for the first quarter dividend in 2006, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.40 per share (a 5 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2006 of $1.60 per share. The year 2005 was the 121st consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 38th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. 30 Table of Contents On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), which created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. We planned to repatriate $8.00 billion in incentive dividends, as defined in the AJCA, during 2005 and accordingly, we recorded a related tax liability of $465.0 million as of December 31, 2004. During 2005, we repatriated all $8.00 billion of eligible incentive dividends. The proceeds from the incentive dividends have been or will be used for research and development activities, capital asset expenditures, and other permitted activities. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, dividends, and taxes in 2006. We believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of short term borrowings, if necessary. Our commercial paper program is also currently backed by $1.23 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities. We currently expect to repay approximately $1.5 billion of debt by the end of 2006, using available cash. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2006 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between 31 Table of Contents fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2005 and 2004, including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. These arrangements are not material individually. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same year, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. The inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. 32 Table of Contents Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More Than 1 3 3 5 Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt, including interest payments(1) $ 12,024.1 $ 983.3 $ 3,893.8 $ 187.6 $ 6,959.4 Capital lease obligations 177.1 21.0 36.5 31.4 88.2 Operating leases 335.5 86.5 130.2 84.5 34.3 Purchase obligations(2) 2,388.5 2,299.5 58.1 28.5 2.4 Other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3) 599.7 90.6 90.6 418.5 Other(4) 73.1 73.1 Total $ 15,598.0 $ 3,463.4 $ 4,209.2 $ 422.6 $ 7,502.8 (1) Our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2005 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. (2) We have included the following: Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2005. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. (3) We have included our long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. (4) This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2005. The amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. Application of Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. This is generally at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. 33 Table of Contents We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. We are generally able to determine when significant wholesaler stocking or destocking has occurred during a particular period, but we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Causes of unusual buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the U.S. could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately $170 million. The new structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying we have seen in the past and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately 1 percent or less of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, chargebacks, long term care, hospital, discount card programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts. We calculate these rebates/discounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups. The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later. Due to the time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate/discount contracts. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. 34 Table of Contents We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs reduced sales by $626.6 million, $641.0 million, and $567.6 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid rebate expense we recognized in 2005 would lead to an approximate $31 million effect on our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. As of December 31, 2005, our Medicaid rebate liability was $272.5 million. Approximately 90 percent and 86 percent of our global rebate and discount liability results from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following represents a roll forward of our most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2005 2004 Rebate and discount liability, beginning of year $ 367.9 $ 398.0 Reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates(1) 1,289.6 1,157.0 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,288.6 ) (1,187.1 ) Rebate and discount liability, end of year $ 368.9 $ 367.9 (1) Adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and the possibility of and the length of time for collection. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. 35 Table of Contents Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company specific yield curve for purposes of determination of the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2005 annual expense would increase by approximately $26 million. A one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2005 service cost and interest cost by approximately $22 million. If the discount rate for 2005 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately $27 million. If the expected return on plan assets for 2005 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately $13 million. If our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2005 were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would be affected by approximately $22 million. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances, and additional uncertainties. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances reserved against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $23 million. 36 Table of Contents Financial Expectations for 2006 For the full year of 2006, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. We expect sales to grow 7 to 9 percent and gross margins as a percent of sales to improve modestly compared with 2005. In addition, we expect operating expenses to grow in the mid single digits in the aggregate, with marketing and administrative expenses accelerating while research and development expense growth moderates somewhat. However, we will continue to be among the industry leaders in terms of research and development investment as a percent of sales. We also expect other income, net of interest expense, to contribute approximately $175 million to $275 million; this ongoing net contribution is expected to be driven primarily by net interest income, Lilly ICOS joint venture after tax profit, and partnering and out licensing of molecules. We also anticipate the effective tax rate to be approximately 21 percent. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, and government investigations; the outcome of the Zyprexa patent appeal; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements. Legal and Regulatory Matters Three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Zenith), Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy), and Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva), submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa in various dosage forms several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents for the product. The generic companies alleged that our patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. We filed suit against the three companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound patent (expiring in 2011) are without merit. The cases were consolidated, and on April 14, 2005, the district court upheld our 2011 U.S. patent on Zyprexa. In the case of Eli Lilly and Company v. Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals et al., the court ruled in our favor on all counts, including the patent doctrines of obviousness, double patenting, inequitable conduct, novelty, and public use. The decision has been appealed. We are confident, and the trial court confirmed, that the generic manufacturers claims are without merit, and we expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and, accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail on appeal. An unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In 2002, Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an ANDA with the FDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista (raloxifene) several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents covering the product, alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed suit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that Barrs challenges to our patents claiming the methods of use and pharmaceutical form (expiring from 2012 to 2017) are without merit. Barr has also asserted that the method of use patents are unenforceable. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued to us two new patents (expiring in 2017) directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing raloxifene and a 37 Table of Contents method for preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis and a third (expiring in 2012) directed to methods of inhibiting postmenopausal bone loss by administering a single daily oral dose of raloxifene. These patents have been listed in the FDAs Orange Book. Barr has challenged these patents, alleging that each is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed. These patents have been added to the pending suit. The suit is in discovery. No trial date has been set at this time. While we believe that Barrs claims are without merit and we expect to prevail, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In January 2006, we were notified that Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), a subsidiary of Teva, submitted an ANDA with the FDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Gemzar several years prior to the expiration of two U.S. patents covering the product. Sicor alleged that both U.S. patents are invalid. In February, we filed suit against Sicor in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that Sicors challenges to our patents claiming the compound (expiring in 2010) and the methods of use (expiring in 2012) are without merit. While we believe that Sicors claims are without merit and we expect to prevail, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. In July 2002, we received the first of several grand jury subpoenas for documents from the Office of Consumer Litigation, U.S. Department of Justice, related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to Evista. We reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in the fourth quarter of 2005, which was subsequently approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in February 2006. As part of the settlement, Lilly pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The plea is for the off label promotion of Evista during 1998. The government did not, however, charge the company with any unlawful intent, nor do we acknowledge any such intent. In connection with the overall settlement, we agreed to pay a total of $36 million. As previously reported, Lilly took a charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 in connection with this investigation. The 2004 charge was sufficient to cover this settlement payment; consequently, no further charge will be necessary. In March 2004, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us that it has commenced a civil investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In October 2005, the U.S. Attorneys office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of Lillys Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney in these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. It is possible that other Lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on 38 Table of Contents our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of health care professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations. We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been notified of several thousand claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the claims) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). The MDL includes three lawsuits requesting certification of class actions on behalf of those who allegedly suffered injuries from the administration of Zyprexa. We have entered into agreements with various plaintiffs counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitation (tolling agreements) with respect to a large number of claimants who do not have lawsuits on file. In June 2005, we entered into an agreement in principle (followed by a definitive master settlement agreement in September 2005) with a group of plaintiffs attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims. The agreement covers more than 8,000 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits (including the three purported class actions), tolled claims, and other informally asserted claims. We established a fund of $690 million for the claimants to settle their claims, and $10 million to cover administration of the settlement. The settlement fund is being overseen and distributed by claims administrators appointed by the court. The agreement and the distribution of funds to participating claimants are conditioned upon, among other things, our obtaining full releases from no fewer than 7,193 claimants. Following this settlement, the remaining U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims include approximately 150 lawsuits in the U.S. covering 465 claimants, and approximately 825 tolled claims. In addition, we have been informally advised of a number of additional potential U.S. claims, but to date have received no substantiation of the claims. Also, in early 2005, we were served with five lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the United States. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining cases. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments on account of their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In addition, in 2006 a similar lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of New York on similar grounds. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed 39 Table of Contents to diabetes or high blood glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa related illnesses. In connection with the Zyprexa product liability claims, certain of our insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and to date have failed to reimburse us for claim related costs despite demand from the first layer carriers for payment. However, in our opinion, the defenses identified to date appear to lack substance. In March 2005, we filed suit against several of the carriers in state court in Indiana to obtain reimbursement of costs related to the Zyprexa product liability litigation. The matter has been removed to the federal court in Indianapolis. Several carriers have asserted defenses to their liability, and some carriers are seeking rescission of the coverage. While we believe our position is meritorious, there can be no assurance that we will prevail. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. With respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us, we have accrued for our estimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and estimable based on the information available to us. In addition, we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. A portion of the costs associated with defending and disposing of these suits is covered by insurance. We record receivables for insurance related recoveries when it is probable they will be realized. These receivables are classified as a reduction of the litigation charges on the statement of income. We estimate insurance recoverables based on existing deductibles, coverage limits, our assessment of any defenses to coverage that might be raised by the carriers, and the existing and projected future level of insolvencies among the insurance carriers. In the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net pre tax charge of $1.07 billion for product liability matters, which includes the following: The $700 million Zyprexa settlement and administration fee; Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding currently known and expected claims to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. A substantial majority of these exposures and costs relate to current and expected Zyprexa claims not included in the settlement. We have estimated these charges based primarily on historical claims experience, data regarding product usage, and our historical product liability defense cost experience. The $1.07 billion net charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters. The after tax impact of this net charge was $.90 per share. The $700 million for the Zyprexa settlement was paid during 2005, while the cash related to the other reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs is expected to be paid out over the next several years. The timing of our insurance recoveries is uncertain. We cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. In addition, although we believe it is probable, there can be no assurance that the Zyprexa 40 Table of Contents settlement described above will be concluded. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims, and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for other products in the future. We have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market, and therefore will be largely self insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the patent, product liability, or other legal actions brought against us, we believe that, except as noted above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.
