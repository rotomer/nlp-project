Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, significant business development, recent product and late stage pipeline developments, and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent, primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products. We increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and diabetes care products, and continued our commitment to research and development, investing approximately 20 percent of our sales during 2006. Our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture as well as cost containment and productivity initiatives. Net income was $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006 as compared with $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 35 percent. Net income comparisons between 2006 and 2005 are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results (see Notes 2, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2006 We recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 4). In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 4 and 13). 2005 We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters, primarily related to Zyprexa, of $1.07 billion (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the second quarter of 2005 (Notes 4 and 13). We recognized asset impairments and other special charges of $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4). We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million (after tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02 (Note 2). 16 Business Development, and Recent Product and Late Stage Pipeline Developments Our long term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and late stage pipeline developments, including: On January 29, 2007, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Corporation for approximately $2.3 billion in cash. The acquisition brings the full value of Cialis to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development, marketing and selling of this product. The allocation of the purchase price has not yet been completed; however, we anticipate that the one time charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development (IPR&D) will approximate $300 million (no tax benefit) (Note 3). In November 2006, we received European Commission authorization to market Byetta as a treatment for type 2 diabetes with our partner, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin). In addition, in December 2006, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Byetta as an add on therapy to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved adequate control on a thiazolidinedione (TZD). We submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Evista for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. We initiated a Phase III clinical trial to study enzastaurin as a maintenance therapy to prevent relapse in patients with non Hodgkins lymphoma. Additionally, we closed the enrollment of a Phase III study of enzastaurin for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after an external data monitoring committee determined the study would likely not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. 17 In July 2006, we received FDA approval for Gemzarfor the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin. Additionally, the United Kingdoms National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended Gemzar coverage under the UKs National Health Service for the use of Gemzar, in combination with paclitaxel, within a limited population of breast cancer patients. In September 2006, we received an approvable letter from the FDA for Arxxanttm for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The FDA has indicated that it will require efficacy data from an additional Phase III study before it will consider approving the molecule. We decided to appeal the FDAs decision and began discussions with the agency. There can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful. We submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA for Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. We are also conducting Phase III studies on Cymbalta for the treatment of fibromyalgia, a chronic, often debilitating pain disorder. In January 2007, we licensed from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OSI), its glucokinase activator (GKA) program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including the lead compound PSN010. We received an exclusive license to develop and market any compounds derived from the GKA program. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $25.0 million (pretax) (Note 3). In January 2007, along with our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, we announced that we completed enrollment in the TRITON study, a Phase III head to head study comparing prasugrel to clopidogrel (Plavix) in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Legal and Governmental Matters In December 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court ruling upholding the validity of our Zyprexa patent. We are very confident we will maintain our U.S. patent protection on Zyprexa until 2011. We have reached agreements with claimants attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately 28,500 claims against us relating to the medication. Approximately 1,300 claims remain. As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial majority of which were related to 18 Zyprexa, we recorded net pretax charges of $1.07 billion in the second quarter of 2005 and $494.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorneys office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that it had commenced a civil investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices. In the United States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which provides a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, took effect January 1, 2006. In 2006, we experienced a one time sales benefit as a result of MMA; however, in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures. While the MMA prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers, legislation was passed in early 2007 by the U.S. House of Representatives that would require HHS to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This legislation will be considered by the U.S. Senate. MMA retains the authority of the Secretary of HHS to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs. Legislation to allow for broad scale importation has been presented to both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The proposed legislation could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the U.S. If adopted, such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our U.S. sales. Current importation language allows for medication to be carried in person from Canada to the U.S. and does not authorize mail or Internet importation. Further, the language disallows certain medications including injectibles. We believe the expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the MMA has further alleviated the perceived need for a federal importation scheme. However, notwithstanding the federal law that continues to prohibit all but the very narrow drug importation detailed above, several states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens, usually involving a website that links patients to selected Canadian pharmacies. The successful implementation of the MMA may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level. A majority of states have implemented supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their Medicaid programs, and these programs are expected to continue in the post MMA environment. Moreover, under the 2005 federal Deficit Reduction Act, states will have greater flexibility to impose new cost sharing requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries for non preferred prescription drugs that will result in certain beneficiaries bearing more of the cost. Several states also are attempting to extend discounted Medicaid prices to non Medicaid patients. As a result, we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue. As it relates to the Medicare program, Lilly has implemented the LillyMedicareAnswers program. Lilly MedicareAnswers is a new patient assistance program that provides certain eligible Medicare Part D enrolled patients access to a one months supply of select medications for a $25 administrative fee per prescription. Medications available via the program include Zyprexa, Forteo, and Humatrope. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. OPERATING RESULTS 2006 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent, to $15.69 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Forteo, Byetta, Zyprexa, and Alimta. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent and selling prices increased sales by 4 percent. Foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth. Sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, to $8.60 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, diabetes care products, Forteo, and Zyprexa. U.S. growth comparisons benefited from an estimated $170 million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, we experienced a one time sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low income patients from Medicaid to Medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our LillyAnswers program following the implementation 19 of MMA in 2006. This contributed part of the increases in U.S. net effective sales prices of 9 percent. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, to $7.09 billion, driven by growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, and Zyprexa. Zyprexa, our top selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 4 percent in 2006, driven by higher prices, offset in part by lower demand. The increase in net effective selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain low income patients from Medicaid to Medicare. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven primarily by increased demand, offset in part by declining prices. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2006 compared with 2005: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2005 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,106.2 $ 2,257.4 $ 4,363.6 $ 4,202.3 4 Gemzar 609.8 798.3 1,408.1 1,334.5 6 Cymbalta 1,158.7 157.7 1,316.4 679.7 94 Humalog 811.0 488.5 1,299.5 1,197.7 9 Evista 664.0 381.3 1,045.3 1,036.1 1 Humulin 367.9 557.4 925.3 1,004.7 (8 ) Animal health products 405.9 469.6 875.5 863.7 1 Alimta 350.1 261.7 611.8 463.2 32 Forteo 416.2 178.1 594.3 389.3 53 Strattera 509.2 69.8 579.0 552.1 5 Actos 279.1 169.4 448.5 493.0 (9 ) Humatrope 202.3 213.3 415.6 414.4 0 Fluoxetine products 152.8 162.3 315.1 453.4 (31 ) ReoPro 110.4 170.0 280.4 296.7 (5 ) Anti infectives 25.1 249.5 274.6 443.9 (38 ) Byetta 219.0 219.0 39.6 NM Cialis2 3.7 212.1 215.8 169.9 27 Xigris 103.4 88.8 192.2 214.6 (10 ) Other pharmaceutical products 104.4 206.6 311.0 396.5 (22 ) Total net sales $ 8,599.2 $ 7,091.8 $ 15,691.0 $14,645.3 7 NM Not meaningful 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Cialis had worldwide 2006 sales of $971.0 million, representing an increase of 30 percent compared with 2005. The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income net in our consolidated statements of income. 20 Diabetes care products, composed primarily of Humalog, our insulin analog; Humulin, a biosynthetic human insulin; Actos, an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; and Byetta, the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin, had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.96 billion in 2006, an increase of 6 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.73 billion. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $1.23 billion. Results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows: Humalog sales increased 10 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices and increased 7 percent outside the U.S., due primarily to increased volume, offset partially by lower prices. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 10 percent due primarily to decreased volume, offset partially by increased selling prices. Outside the U.S., Humulin sales decreased 6 percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices. Actos revenues in the U.S., the majority of which represent service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda), decreased 22 percent in 2006. Actos is manufactured by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos expired in September 2006; however, we will continue receiving royalties from Takeda. As a result, our revenues from Actos will decline each year through September 2009. Our arrangement outside the U.S. continues. Sales outside the U.S. increased 23 percent, due primarily to increased volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset in part by lower prices. Sales of Byetta, launched in the U.S. in June 2005, were $430.2 million for 2006. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byettas gross margin and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005. Gemzar sales increased 7 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, increased 82 percent in the U.S., due to strong demand. Sales of Cymbalta outside the U.S. reflect international launches. Worldwide sales exceeded $1 billion in 2006, the products second full year on the market. 21 Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices, offset partially by a decline in demand. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista decreased 1 percent, driven by lower prices, offset by an increase in demand. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and second line treatment for non smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the U.S. and outside the U.S., respectively, due primarily to increased demand. Sales of Forteo, a treatment for severe osteoporosis, increased 57 percent in the U.S. In addition to increased demand, U.S. sales significantly benefited from patients access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and from decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program, LillyAnswers. Sales outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, reflecting a strong demand. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005, offset by a decline in demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset partially by lower prices. Total product sales of Cialis, an erectile dysfunction treatment, increased 38 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent outside the U.S. Worldwide Cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains, market growth, and price increases during 2006. Cialis sales in our territories are reported in net sales, while our 50 percent share of the joint venture net income is reported in other income net. All sales of Cialis subsequent to the ICOS acquisition in 2007 will be included in our revenue. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, due primarily to increased demand led by Rumensin and Tylan. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of Surmax as a result of the European Unions growth promotion use ban on the product, effective January 1, 2006. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2006 gross margin increased to 77.4 percent of sales compared with 76.3 percent for 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. 22 Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses) increased 7 percent in 2006. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $3.13 billion, primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and development during 2006. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2006, to $4.89 billion. This increase was largely attributable to increased marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise, and an increase in litigation related costs. Other income net decreased $76.4 million, to $237.8 million, and consists of interest expense, interest income, the after tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. Interest expense for 2006 increased $132.9 million, to $238.1 million. This increase is a result of higher interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the completion in late 2005 of certain manufacturing facilities. Interest income for 2006 increased $49.8 million, to $261.9 million, due to higher short term interest rates. The Lilly ICOS joint venture income was $96.3 million in 2006 as compared to $11.1 million in 2005. The increase was due to increased Cialis sales and decreased selling and marketing expenses. Net other miscellaneous income items decreased $78.5 million to $117.7 million, primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicensing of legacy products and partnered compounds in development. We incurred tax expense of $755.3 million in 2006, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.1 percent, compared with 26.3 percent for 2005. The effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product liability charges of $494.9 million and $1.07 billion, respectively. The tax expense of these charges was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax expense was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 23 OPERATING RESULTS 2005 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent, due in part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets. In addition, we launched one new product in the U.S. and several new products, new indications, or new formulations in key markets in 2005. We continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite product launch expenditures, our cost containment and productivity measures contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales. During 2005, we began to expense stock options, which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses. We also benefited from an increase in other income net, due primarily to increased profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005. Net income was $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005 as compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 9 percent. Certain items, reflected in our operating results for 2005 and 2004, should be considered in comparing the two years. The significant items for 2005 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2004 items are summarized as follows (see Notes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): In 2005, we began to expense stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Had we expensed stock options in 2004, our 2004 net income would have been lower by $266.4 million, which would have decreased earnings per share by $.24 per share (Notes 1 and 7). We recognized asset impairment charges, streamlined our infrastructure, and provided for the anticipated resolution of the government investigation of Evista marketing and promotional practices, resulting in charges of $108.9 million (pretax) in the second quarter of 2004 and $494.1 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter of 2004, which decreased earnings per share by $.08 and $.30, respectively (Note 4). We incurred charges for acquired in process research and development (IPR&D) of $362.3 million (no tax benefit) in the first quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition of Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. (AME), and $29.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to our acquisition of a Phase I compound under development as a potential treatment for insomnia, which decreased earnings per share by $.33 in the first quarter of 2004 and $.02 in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Note 3). We recognized tax expenses of $465.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 associated with the anticipated repatriation in 2005 of $8.00 billion of our earnings reinvested outside the U.S., as a result of the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This tax expense decreased earnings per share by $.43 in that quarter (Note 10). Sales Our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent, to $14.65 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, Forteo, and Gemzar. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately $170 million. Sales growth in 2005 was also affected by decreased U.S. demand for Zyprexa, Strattera, and Prozac. Despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand, sales in the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $7.80 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $6.85 billion, driven by growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 3 percent, with global selling prices contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) 24 The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2005 compared with 2004: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2004 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,034.9 $ 2,167.4 $ 4,202.3 $ 4,419.8 (5 ) Gemzar 586.1 748.4 1,334.5 1,214.4 10 Humalog 739.6 458.1 1,197.7 1,101.6 9 Evista 652.9 383.2 1,036.1 1,012.7 2 Humulin 410.7 594.0 1,004.7 997.7 1 Animal health products 370.3 493.4 863.7 798.7 8 Cymbalta 636.2 43.5 679.7 93.9 NM Strattera 498.7 53.4 552.1 666.7 (17 ) Actos 355.7 137.3 493.0 452.9 9 Alimta 296.3 166.9 463.2 142.6 NM Fluoxetine products 249.1 204.3 453.4 559.0 (19 ) Anti infectives 133.3 310.6 443.9 478.0 (7 ) Humatrope 184.5 229.9 414.4 430.3 (4 ) Forteo 264.7 124.6 389.3 238.6 63 ReoPro 119.8 176.9 296.7 362.8 (18 ) Xigris 118.9 95.7 214.6 201.8 6 Cialis2 2.3 167.6 169.9 130.6 30 Symbyax 52.6 1.3 53.9 70.2 (23 ) Other pharmaceutical products 91.5 290.7 382.2 485.6 (21 ) Total net sales $ 7,798.1 $ 6,847.2 $ 14,645.3 $13,857.9 6 NM Not meaningful 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Cialis had worldwide 2005 sales of $746.6 million, representing an increase of 35 percent compared with 2004. The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income net in our consolidated statements of income. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 16 percent in 2005, resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures. Sales outside the U.S. in 2005 increased 9 percent, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased by 6 percent. Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.80 billion in 2005, an increase of 7 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $1.59 billion, primarily driven by higher prices, offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.20 billion. Humalog sales increased 8 percent in the U.S. and 10 percent outside the U.S. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 3 percent, while Humulin sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent. Actos revenues increased 9 percent in 2005. Sales of Byetta were $74.6 million following its June 2005 launch. Our reported net sales of Byetta totaled $39.6 million in 2005. Sales of Gemzar increased 4 percent in the U.S. in 2005 and were negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Gemzar sales increased 15 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications. Sales of Evista decreased 2 percent in the U.S. due to declines in U.S. underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and to reductions in wholesaler inventory levels. This decline was partially 25 offset by price increases. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista increased 11 percent, driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan. Cymbalta was launched in the U.S. in late August 2004 for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in September 2004 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Cymbalta launches began in Europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005. Cymbalta generated $679.7 million in sales in 2005. Sales of Strattera declined 24 percent in the U.S. in 2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $53.4 million in 2005, compared with $10.3 million in 2004, primarily reflecting launches in Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Spain. Alimta was launched in the U.S. in February 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in August for second line treatment of non smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alimta was launched in several European countries in the second half of 2004 and throughout 2005. Alimta generated sales of $463.2 million in 2005. Forteo increased 34 percent in the U.S. in 2005, driven by strong growth in underlying demand. Sales growth was offset, in part, by wholesaler destocking in the first half of 2005 related to our revised arrangements with U.S. wholesalers. Cialis worldwide sales of $746.6 million in 2005 reflected an increase of 35 percent compared to 2004, and comprises $169.9 million of sales in our territories, and $576.7 million of sales in the joint venture territories. Within the joint venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis were $272.9 million for 2005, an increase of 32 percent, despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, led by Rumensin and Paylean. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2005 gross margin decreased to 76.3 percent of sales compared with 76.7 percent for 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses. Operating expenses increased 8 percent in 2005. Investment in research and development increased 12 percent, to $3.03 billion, in 2005, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 21 percent of our sales into research and development during 2005. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005, to $4.50 billion, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. This comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Research and development expenses would have increased by 8 percent, and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005, if 2004 had been restated as if stock options had been expensed. Other income net increased $35.8 million in 2005, to $314.2 million, due to the following: Interest expense for 2005 increased $53.6 million, to $105.2 million, primarily due to increased interest rates. Interest income for 2005 increased $55.4 million, to $212.1 million, due to increased investment balances and interest rates. 26 Our net income from the Lilly ICOS joint venture was $11.1 million for 2005, compared with a net loss of $79.0 million in 2004. The joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of 2005. Net other miscellaneous income items decreased $56.1 million to $196.2 million, primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 26.3 percent, compared with 38.5 percent for 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005 was affected by the product liability charge of $1.07 billion. The tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. The effective tax rate for 2004 was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $3.89 billion compared with $5.04 billion at December 31, 2005. Strong cash flow from operations in 2006 of $3.98 billion was more than offset by repayments of long term debt of $2.78 billion, dividends paid of $1.74 billion, and capital expenditures of $1.08 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.08 billion during 2006 were $220.3 million less than in 2005, due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects. We expect near term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2006 levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives, continue to upgrade our manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt as of December 31, 2006 was $3.71 billion, reflecting a net repayment of $2.78 billion during 2006. In early 2007, we issued approximately $2.5 billion of debt to finance our acquisition of ICOS, including the acquisition of ICOS stock and refinancing of ICOS debt. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys remain at AA and Aa3, respectively. Dividends of $1.60 per share were paid in 2006, an increase of 5 percent from 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, effective for the first quarter dividend in 2007, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.425 per share (a 6 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2007 of $1.70 per share. The year 2006 was the 122nd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 39th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. 27 We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with product liability litigation, dividends, and taxes in 2007. We believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of short term borrowings, if necessary. We currently have $1.21 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Excluding the longterm debt issued for the ICOS acquisition, we plan to use available cash to repay approximately $1 billion of debt outside the U.S. by the end of 2007. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2007 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. 28 In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2006 and 2005, including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, 29 results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt, including interest payments1 $ 5,638.1 $ 374.0 $ 1,703.5 $ 265.4 $ 3,295.2 Capital lease obligations 152.6 19.8 36.1 24.2 72.5 Operating leases 412.2 92.2 136.0 76.8 107.2 Purchase obligations2 2,105.0 1,879.4 140.9 68.3 16.4 Other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 836.8 78.6 135.9 138.2 484.1 Other4 67.1 67.1 Total $ 9,211.8 $ 2,511.1 $ 2,152.4 $ 572.9 $ 3,975.4 1 Our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2006 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2006. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included our long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. The inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2006. The amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, 30 expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the U.S. could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our 2005 sales by approximately $170 million. The modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long term care, hospital, discount card programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts. We calculate these rebates/discounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups. The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later. Due to the time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate/discount contracts. 31 Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $571.7 million, $637.1 million, and $641.0 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2006 would lead to an approximate $29 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2006, our Medicaid and Medicare rebate liability was $259.0 million. Approximately 85 percent and 90 percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following represents a roll forward of our most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2006 2005 Rebate and discount liability, beginning of year $ 379.4 $ 367.9 Reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates1 1,246.1 1,300.1 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,242.2 ) (1,288.6 ) Rebate and discount liability, end of year $ 383.3 $ 379.4 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and the possibility of and the length of time for collection. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts 32 reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2006 annual expense would increase by approximately $28 million. A one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2006 service cost and interest cost by approximately $24 million. If the discount rate for 2006 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $28 million. If the expected return on plan assets for 2006 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $14 million. If our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2006 were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately $29 million. Impairment of Long lived Assets We review the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the assets net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require managements judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances and additional uncertainties. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carry forwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future 33 income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $25 million. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2007 For the full year of 2007, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99. This guidance includes the estimated $.10 per share dilutive impact of the ICOS acquisition related to the incremental interest expense on debt used to finance the acquisition, the amortization of ICOS intangibles and other integration costs. A disproportionate amount of this dilution is expected to be incurred in the first half of the year. This guidance also includes the IPR&D charges related to the ICOS acquisition and the in licensing of a diabetes compound from OSI, together estimated to be a total of $.29 per share as discussed in Note 3, as well as additional restructuring and other special charges as discussed in Note 4, estimated to be $.07 per share. We expect sales to grow in the high single or low double digits, impacted favorably by the inclusion of all Cialis revenue subsequent to the acquisition. Gross margins as a percent of sales are expected to improve slightly compared with 2006. In addition, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low double digits, driven primarily by the inclusion of all Cialis operating expenses subsequent to the acquisition and increased marketing and selling expenses in support of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, and the diabetes care franchise, as well as ongoing investment in research and development that will continue to place Lilly among the industry leaders in terms of research and development as a percent of sales. We also expect other income net to contribute less than $100 million, a reduction from 2006 due to the removal of the Lilly ICOS joint venture after tax profit. Other income will primarily include net interest income and income from the partnering and out licensing of molecules. In terms of cash flow, we expect a continuation of strong cash flow trends in 2007, with capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy), Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals (together, Teva), each submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2011) and alleging that this patent was invalid or not enforceable. We filed lawsuits against these companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that the patent is valid, enforceable and being infringed. The district court ruled in our favor on all counts on April 14, 2005, and on December 26, 2006, that ruling was upheld by the Court 34 of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Reddy and Teva are seeking a review of that decision. We are confident Reddys and Tevas claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. An unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an ANDA in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2012 2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that our relevant U.S. patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. No trial date has been set in either case. We believe Barrs and Tevas claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), a subsidiary of Teva, submitted ANDAs in November 2005 seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2010 and 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. In February 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Sicor in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid and are being infringed by Sicor. In response to our lawsuit, Sicor filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Sicor also moved to dismiss our lawsuit in Indiana, asserting the Indiana court lacks jurisdiction. The California action has been dismissed. In September 2006, we received notice that Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne) filed a similar ANDA for Gemzar. In October 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Mayne in the Southern District of Indiana in response to the ANDA filing. In response to our lawsuit, Mayne filed a motion to our lawsuit, asserting the Indiana court lacks jurisdiction. In October 2006, we received notice that Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) filed an ANDA for Gemzar, alleging that the 2013 patent is invalid. In December 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Sun in the Southern District of Indiana in response to Suns ANDA filing. We expect to prevail in litigation involving our Gemzar patents and believe that claims made by these generic companies that our patents are not valid are without merit. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In June 2002, we were sued by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the President and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. In June 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office commenced a re examination of the patent in order to consider certain issues raised by us relating to the validity of the patent. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial. We are seeking to have the jury verdict overturned by the trial court judge, and if unsuccessful, will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held the week of August 7, 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. No decision has been rendered. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. 35 Government Investigations In March 2004, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us that it had commenced a civil investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In October 2005, the U.S. Attorneys Office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of Lillys Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney in these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney Generals office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexas status on Californias formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health care providers. Beginning in August 2006, we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states. Most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. We are aware that 26 states are participating in this joint effort, and we anticipate that additional states will join the investigation. These attorneys general are seeking a broad range of Zyprexa documents, including documents relating to sales, marketing and promotional practices, and remuneration of health care providers. It is possible that other Lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of health care professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations. Product Liability and Related Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the claims) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 28,500 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. That settlement is being administered by special settlement masters appointed by Judge Weinstein. In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. 36 The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during 2005. The January 2007 settlements were recorded in other current liabilities in our December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet and will be paid in the first quarter of 2007. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 340 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 900 claimants and an additional 400 claims of which we are aware. In addition, we have been served with a lawsuit seeking class certification in which the members of the purported class are seeking refunds and medical monitoring. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining cases. We currently anticipate that trials in seven cases in the Eastern District of New York will begin in the second quarter of 2007. We have insurance coverage for a portion of our Zyprexa product liability claims exposure. The third party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies. The dispute is now the subject of litigation in the federal court in Indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in Bermuda against other carriers. While we believe our position has merit, there can be no assurance that we will prevail. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. In the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net pretax charge of $1.07 billion for product liability matters. The charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters. The charge covered the following: The cost of the June 2005 Zyprexa settlements described above; and Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the then known and expected product liability claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. A substantial majority of those exposures and costs were related to then known and expected Zyprexa claims. As a result of the January 2007 settlements discussed above, we incurred a pretax charge of $494.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The charge covered the following: The cost of the January 2007 Zyprexa settlements; and Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the then known and expected Zyprexa product liability claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa related illnesses. In 2006, we were served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, West Virginia, New Mexico, and Mississippi in the courts of the respective states. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, 37 punitive damages, and attorneys fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on similar grounds. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. We cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. In addition, although we believe it is probable, there can be no assurance that the January 2007 Zyprexa product liability settlements described above will be concluded. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely self insured for future product liability losses. In addition, as noted above, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.
