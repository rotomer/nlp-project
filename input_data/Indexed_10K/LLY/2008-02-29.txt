Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Review of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, significant business development, recent product and late stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 19 percent. This growth was primarily driven by volume increases in a number of key products, with a significant portion of this increase in volume resulting from the acquisition of ICOS. Our additional investments in marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, contributed to this sales growth and enabled us to increase our investment in research and development 11 percent in 2007. While cost of sales and operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the same rate as sales, other income net decreased and the effective tax rate increased. As a result, net income and earnings per share increased 11 percent, to $2.95 billion, or $2.71 per share, in 2007 as compared with $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006. Net income comparisons between 2007 and 2006 are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results (see Notes 3, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2007 We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $98.2 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.07. In the first quarter, we recognized similar charges associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities of $123.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.08 (Note 4). We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over Zyprexa product liability claims, which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries. This resulted in a charge of $81.3 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.06 in the third quarter (Notes 4 and 13). We incurred in process research and development (IPRD) charges associated with our licensing arrangement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India of $45.0 million (pretax) and our licensing arrangement with MacroGenics, Inc., of $44.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.05 in the fourth quarter (Note 3). We incurred IPRD charges associated with the acquisition of Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), of $291.1 million (no tax benefit) and the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), of $37.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29 in the second quarter (Note 3). We incurred IPRD charges associated with the acquisition of ICOS of $303.5 million (no tax benefit) and a licensing arrangement with OSI Pharmaceuticals of $25.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29 in the first quarter (Note 3). 2006 We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 4). In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 4 and 13). 17 Late Stage Pipeline Developments and Business Development Activity Our long term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have achieved a number of successes with late stage pipeline developments and recent business development transactions within the past year, including: Pipeline On December 26, 2007, together with our collaboration partner Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, we submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for prasugrel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The proposed trademark for prasugrel is Effienttm. The submission follows the release of results of the TRITON TIMI 38 Phase III head to head study of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in November. In January 2008, the FDA approved Cialis for once daily use to treat erectile dysfunction. Cialis was approved by the European Commission for once daily use in June 2007. In November, the FDA approved Cymbalta for the maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. In February, the FDA approved Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. During 2007, we submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia. In October, with our collaboration partners Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Alkermes, Inc., we announced positive results from a 30 week comparator study of once weekly exenatide long acting release injection and Byetta (exenatide) injection taken twice daily in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the second quarter, we submitted NDAs to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for approval of olanzapine (Zyprexa) long acting injection. In late February 2008, the FDA issued a not approvable letter, stating it needs more information to better understand the risk and underlying cause of excessive sedation events that have been observed in about one percent of patients in clinical trials. 18 In September, the FDA approved Evista for a new use to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in two populations: postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer. We submitted an application to the EMEA for centralized review of Alimta, in combination with cisplatin, for the first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer. Business Development In December, we entered into a licensing and development agreement with BioMS Medical Corp. whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple sclerosis (MS) compound. The compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and one Phase II clinical trial in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). In connection with this agreement, we will incur a charge to earnings for acquired IPRD of $87.0 million (pretax), which will be included as expense in the first quarter of 2008. In October, we entered into an agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India whereby we acquired the rights to a portfolio of transient receptor potential vanilloid sub family 1 (TRPV1) antagonist molecules, including a clinical phase compound. The compound is currently in Phase II development as a potential next generation treatment for various pain conditions, including osteoarthritic pain. In October, we entered into a global strategic alliance with MacroGenics, Inc., to develop and commercialize teplizumab, a humanized anti CD3 monoclonal antibody, as well as other potential next generation anti CD3 molecules for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As part of the arrangement, we acquired the exclusive rights to the molecule. Teplizumab is currently being studied in the PROTG trial, a global pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial for individuals with recent onset type 1 diabetes. In June, we completed the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, Inc., a privately held applied research and pharmaceutical product development company focused on the animal health industry. The acquisition provides us with product lines that complement those of our animal health business. In April, we completed the acquisition of Hypnion, Inc., a privately held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep disorders. The deal expands our presence in the area of sleep disorder research and provides ownership of a novel Phase II insomnia compound with a dual mechanism of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset and sleep maintenance. In January, we completed the acquisition of ICOS at a cost of approximately $2.3 billion. The acquisition brings the full value of Cialis to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development, marketing, and selling of this product. In January, we licensed from OSI Pharmaceuticals its glucokinase activator (GKA) program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including the lead compound. Lilly received an exclusive license to develop and market any compounds derived from the GKA program. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In October, the United States Supreme Court denied the petitions for certiorari that were filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals and Dr. Reddys Laboratories, bringing to an end the two companies challenges to the validity of Lillys U.S. Zyprexa patent. In June, we received notice of two court rulings by the Canadian Federal Court and the German Patent Court that permit the entry of generic olanzapine (Zyprexa) by competitors into the Canadian and German markets. Generic olanzapine is now available for sale by competitors in Canada and Germany. We have reached agreements with claimants attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately 31,200 claims against us relating to the medication. Approximately 1,235 claims remain. As a result of our product liability exposures, since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product liability matters. 19 In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorneys office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) that it had commenced an investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In November 2007, we received a grand jury subpoena from the EDPA requesting documents related to Zyprexa. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) continues to effectively provide a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program (known as Medicare Part D). Various measures have been discussed and or passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products, including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to Medicaid patients. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to continue. In 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a final rule seeking to implement sections of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This rule relates to the Medicaid program and among other things, sets out a methodology for the calculation and use of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price for pharmaceuticals. We have implemented the final rule, which has the effect of reducing net selling prices for Medicaid sales; however, we do not expect the impact to be material to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. OPERATING RESULTS 2007 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2007 increased 19 percent, to $18.63 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis since our January 29, 2007 acquisition of ICOS and sales growth of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Humalog. Worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent, while selling prices and foreign exchange rates each increased sales by 3 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, to $10.15 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, and Byetta, and the inclusion of Cialis. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, to $8.49 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis, and sales growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Cymbalta. Zyprexa, our top selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2007, driven by higher net selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder, increased 58 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by strong demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 70 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declining prices. 20 The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2007 compared with 2006: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2006 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,236.0 $ 2,525.0 $ 4,761.0 $ 4,363.6 9 Cymbalta 1,835.6 267.3 2,102.9 1,316.4 60 Gemzar 670.0 922.4 1,592.4 1,408.1 13 Humalog 888.0 586.6 1,474.6 1,299.5 13 Cialis2 423.8 720.0 1,143.8 215.8 NM Evista 706.1 384.6 1,090.7 1,045.3 4 Animal health products 480.9 514.9 995.8 875.5 14 Humulin 365.2 620.0 985.2 925.3 6 Alimta 448.0 406.0 854.0 611.8 40 Forteo 494.1 215.2 709.3 594.3 19 Strattera 464.6 104.8 569.4 579.0 (2 ) Humatrope 213.6 227.2 440.8 415.6 6 Actos 150.8 219.8 370.6 448.5 (17 ) Byetta 316.5 14.2 330.7 219.0 51 Other pharmaceutical products 452.3 760.0 1,212.3 1,373.3 (12 ) Total net sales $ 10,145.5 $ 8,488.0 $ 18,633.5 $ 15,691.0 19 NM Not meaningful 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS, the Cialis sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income net in our consolidated income statement. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net sales. 21 Total worldwide sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, were $1.22 billion and $971.0 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Worldwide sales grew 25 percent in 2007. U.S. sales increased 20 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 28 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices. Prior to the ICOS acquisition, Cialis sales in our territories were reported in net sales, while our 50 percent share of the joint venture net income was reported in other income net. All sales of Cialis subsequent to the ICOS acquisition are reported in our net sales. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and lower demand. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Alimta, a second line treatment for non small cell lung cancer and in combination with another agent, for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma, increased 28 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 55 percent, driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture, increased 19 percent in the U.S., driven by higher net selling prices. U.S. sales growth benefited from access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program and to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 21 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 22 Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, decreased 9 percent in the U.S., as a result of decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Our revenues from Actos, an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, a portion of which represent revenues from a copromotion agreement in the U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda), decreased 46 percent in the U.S. Actos is manufactured by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos expired in September 2006; however, we continue to receive royalties from Takeda through September 2009 at rates that decline each year. Our arrangement outside the U.S. continues. Sales outside the U.S. increased 30 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which we market with Amylin Pharmaceuticals (Amylin), increased 51 percent to $650.2 million during 2007. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byettas gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues increased 51 percent to $330.7 million in 2007. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, driven by increased demand, the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, and new companion animal product launches. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2007 gross margin decreased to 77.2 percent of sales compared with 77.4 percent for 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales, offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses) increased 19 percent in 2007. Investment in research and development increased 11 percent, to $3.49 billion. In addition to the acquisition of ICOS, this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late stage clinical trial costs. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing 23 approximately 19 percent of our sales into research and development during 2007. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2007, to $6.10 billion. This increase was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Acquired IPRD charges were $745.6 million in 2007 and related to the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion, and Ivy, as well as our licensing arrangements with OSI, MacroGenics, and Glenmark. We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $302.5 million in 2007 as compared to $945.2 million in 2006. See Notes 3, 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other income net decreased $115.8 million, to $122.0 million. This line item consists of interest expense, interest income, the after tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. Interest expense for 2007 decreased $9.8 million, to $228.3 million. This decrease is a result of lower average debt balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest income for 2007 decreased $46.6 million, to $215.3 million, due to lower cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006. The Lilly ICOS joint venture income was $11.0 million in 2007 as compared to $96.3 million in 2006, due to the acquisition of ICOS on January 29, 2007. Net other miscellaneous income items increased $6.3 million to $124.0 million. We incurred tax expense of $923.8 million in 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent, compared with 22.1 percent for 2006. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were affected primarily by the nondeductible ICOS and Hypnion IPRD charges of $594.6 million in 2007, and the product liability charges of $494.9 million in 2006. The tax effect of the product liability charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 24 OPERATING RESULTS 2006 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent, primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products. We increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and continued our commitment to research and development, investing approximately 20 percent of our sales during 2006. Our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture as well as cost containment and productivity initiatives. Net income was $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006 as compared with $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 35 percent. Certain items, reflected in our operating results for 2006 and 2005, should be considered in comparing the two years. The significant items for 2006 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2005 items are summarized as follows (see Notes 2, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters, primarily related to Zyprexa, of $1.07 billion (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the second quarter (Notes 4 and 13). We recognized asset impairments and other special charges of $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4). We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million (after tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02 (Note 2). Sales Our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent, to $15.69 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Forteo, Byetta, Zyprexa, and Alimta. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent, and selling prices increased sales by 4 percent. Foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth. Sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, to $8.60 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, diabetes care products, Forteo, and Zyprexa. U.S. growth comparisons benefited from an estimated $170 million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, we experienced a sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low income patients from Medicaid to Medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our LillyAnswers program following the implementation of MMA in 2006. This contributed part of the increases in U.S. net effective sales prices of 9 percent. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, to $7.09 billion, driven by growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, and Zyprexa. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 4 percent in 2006, driven by higher prices, offset in part by lower demand. The increase in net selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain low income patients from Medicaid to Medicare. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven primarily by increased demand, offset in part by declining prices. Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.96 billion in 2006, an increase of 6 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.73 billion. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $1.23 billion. Results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows: Humalog sales increased 10 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, and increased 7 percent outside the U.S., due primarily to increased volume, offset partially by lower prices. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 10 percent due primarily to decreased volume, offset partially by increased selling prices. Outside the U.S., Humulin sales decreased 6 percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices. 25 Actos revenues in the U.S. decreased 22 percent in 2006, due to the expiration of our U.S. marketing rights in September 2006. Sales outside the U.S. increased 23 percent, due primarily to increased volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset in part by lower prices. Total sales of Byetta, launched in the U.S. in June 2005, were $430.2 million for 2006. Sales of Gemzar increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005. Gemzar sales increased 7 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume. Sales of Cymbalta increased 82 percent in the U.S., due to strong demand. Sales of Cymbalta outside the U.S. reflect international launches. Sales of Evista increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices, offset partially by a decline in demand. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista decreased 1 percent, driven by lower prices, offset by an increase in demand. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2006 compared with 2005: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2005 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,106.2 $ 2,257.4 $ 4,363.6 $ 4,202.3 4 Gemzar 609.8 798.3 1,408.1 1,334.5 6 Cymbalta 1,158.7 157.7 1,316.4 679.7 94 Humalog 811.0 488.5 1,299.5 1,197.7 9 Evista 664.0 381.3 1,045.3 1,036.1 1 Humulin 367.9 557.4 925.3 1,004.7 (8 ) Animal health products 405.9 469.6 875.5 863.7 1 Alimta 350.1 261.7 611.8 463.2 32 Forteo 416.2 178.1 594.3 389.3 53 Strattera 509.2 69.8 579.0 552.1 5 Actos 279.1 169.4 448.5 493.0 (9 ) Humatrope 202.3 213.3 415.6 414.4 0 Byetta 219.0 219.0 39.6 NM Cialis2 3.7 212.1 215.8 169.9 27 Other pharmaceutical products 496.1 877.2 1,373.3 1,805.1 (24 ) Total net sales $ 8,599.2 $ 7,091.8 $ 15,691.0 $ 14,645.3 7 NM Not meaningful 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Cialis had worldwide 2006 sales of $971.0 million, representing an increase of 30 percent compared with 2005. The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income net in our consolidated statements of income. Sales of Alimta increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the U.S. and outside the U.S., respectively, due primarily to increased demand. Sales of Forteo increased 57 percent in the U.S. In addition to increased demand, U.S. sales significantly benefited from patients access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and from decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program, LillyAnswers. Sales outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, reflecting strong demand. 26 Sales of Strattera increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005, offset by a decline in demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset partially by lower prices. Total product sales of Cialis increased 38 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent outside the U.S. Worldwide Cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains, market growth, and price increases during 2006. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, due primarily to increased demand led by Rumensin and Tylan. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of Surmax as a result of the European Unions growth promotion use ban on the product, effective January 1, 2006. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2006 gross margin increased to 77.4 percent of sales compared with 76.3 percent for 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. Operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2006. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $3.13 billion, primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and development during 2006. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2006, to $4.89 billion. This increase was largely attributable to increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise, and an increase in litigation related costs. Other income net decreased $76.4 million, to $237.8 million. Interest expense for 2006 increased $132.9 million, to $238.1 million. This increase was a result of higher interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the completion in late 2005 of certain manufacturing facilities. Interest income for 2006 increased $49.8 million, to $261.9 million, due to higher short term interest rates. The Lilly ICOS joint venture income was $96.3 million in 2006 as compared to $11.1 million in 2005. The increase was due to increased Cialis sales and decreased selling and marketing expenses. Net other miscellaneous income items decreased $78.5 million, to $117.7 million, primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicensing of legacy products and partnered compounds in development. We incurred tax expense of $755.3 million in 2006, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.1 percent, compared with 26.3 percent for 2005. The effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product liability charges of $494.9 million and $1.07 billion, respectively. The tax benefit associated with these charges was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $4.83 billion compared with $3.89 billion at December 31, 2006. Cash flow from operations in 2007 of $5.15 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $1.45 billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of $2.67 billion, dividends paid of $1.85 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $1.08 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.08 billion during 2007 were consistent with 2006, due primarily to the management of capital spending. We expect near term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2007 levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives, continue to upgrade our 27 manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt as of December 31, 2007 increased $1.29 billion, to $5.01 billion, reflecting the $2.50 billion of debt we issued in 2007 to finance our acquisition of ICOS, offset by long term debt repayment of $1.06 billion. Our current debt ratings from Standard Poors and Moodys remain at AA and Aa3, respectively. Dividends of $1.70 per share were paid in 2007, an increase of 6 percent from 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2007, effective for the first quarter dividend in 2008, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.47 per share (a 10.6 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2008 of $1.88 per share. The year 2007 was the 123rd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 40th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with product liability litigation, dividends, and taxes in 2008. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings, if necessary. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2008 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. 28 In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2007 and 2006, including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. 29 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and partner assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. The inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt, including interest payments1 $ 9,582.3 $ 645.6 $ 522.4 $ 1,000.7 $ 7,413.6 Capital lease obligations 72.5 15.5 20.3 5.8 30.9 Operating leases 305.4 93.7 129.5 76.2 6.0 Purchase obligations2 5,101.7 4,575.5 330.3 149.7 46.2 Other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 829.3 154.3 159.7 515.3 Other4 146.3 146.3 Total $ 16,037.5 $ 5,476.6 $ 1,156.8 $ 1,392.1 $ 8,012.0 1 Our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2007 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2007. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included our long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.57 billion are excluded as reasonable estimates could not be made regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. 30 The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2007. The amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the U.S. could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our 2005 sales by approximately $170 million. The modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid 31 recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate/discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Due to the time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $642.1 million, $571.7 million, and $637.1 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2007 would lead to an approximate $32 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2007, our Medicaid and Medicare rebate liability was $308.8 million. Approximately 75 percent and 85 percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following represents a roll forward of our most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2007 2006 Rebate and discount liability, beginning of year $ 383.3 $ 379.4 Reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates1 1,314.1 1,246.1 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,228.6 ) (1,242.2 ) Rebate and discount liability, end of year $ 468.8 $ 383.3 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and the possibility of and the length of time for collection. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. 32 Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2007 annual expense would increase by approximately $28 million. A one percentage point decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2007 service cost and interest cost by approximately $23 million. If the 2007 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $32 million. If the 2007 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $14 million. If our assumption regarding the 2007 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately $31 million. The U.S. plans represent approximately 80 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2007. Impairment of Long lived Assets We review the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the assets net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require managements judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of 33 an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $78 million and $26 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2008 For the full year of 2008, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.95. This guidance includes the anticipated acquired in process research and development charges of $.05 related to the BioMS in licensing agreement. We expect sales to grow in the mid to high single digits, driven primarily by increased volume and strong sales growth for Cymbalta, Cialis, Byetta, Alimta, and Humalog. We expect modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales, driven primarily by manufacturing expenses growing more slowly than sales. In addition, we expect operating expenses to grow more slowly than sales in 2008, with growth in the mid single digits. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to grow in the low single digits, driven by investments in prasugrel, Cymbalta, Evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction, Humalog, and Byetta, offset by decreases in other areas. Research and development expenses are expected to grow in the high single to low double digits. Other income net is expected to contribute less than $100 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 percent. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring 34 in 2012 2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a similar lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is currently scheduled for trial beginning March 9, 2009, while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Barr. We believe that Barrs and Tevas claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each submitted ANDAs seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and method of use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Sicor (February 2006) and Mayne (October 2006), seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being infringed. In November 2007, the lawsuit against Mayne was stayed and administratively closed by the court. Also in November 2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking a ruling that our method of use patent is invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the sale of Suns generic product. Sun informed us in December 2007 that it is also challenging our compound patent, and that patent has now been added to the declaratory judgment action. In January 2008, we filed a second lawsuit against Mayne in response to a second ANDA filed by Mayne for a new dosage strength. We expect to prevail in this litigation and believe that these claims are without merit. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA (Glenmark), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Synthon Laboratories, Inc. (Synthon), and Zydus Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc. (Zydus) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this patent is invalid. We filed a lawsuit against Actavis in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in August 2007. Sandoz filed a declaratory judgment action in the same court, but its case has been dismissed. In September 2007, we amended the complaint in the New Jersey lawsuit to add Glenmark, Sun, Sandoz, Mylan, Teva, Apotex, Aurobindo, Synthon, and Zydus as defendants. We filed a second action against Synthon in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Synthon has filed a motion to dismiss our lawsuit in New Jersey. In December 2007, Zydus agreed to entry of a consent judgment in which Zydus conceded the validity and enforceability of the patent and agreed to a permanent injunction. We expect to prevail in this litigation and believe that these claims are without merit. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the U.S.: In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method of use patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and Apotex has appealed that ruling. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held that the invalidity allegations of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), were justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We have appealed that decision and sued Novopharm for patent infringement. The appeal was dismissed. In November 2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of 35 our Zyprexa compound and method of use patents (expiring in 2011). The trial court ruled in our favor in February 2007. Apotex will likely appeal. In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Egis Gyogyszergyar and Neolabs Ltd. challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method of use patents (expiring in 2011). In June 2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. We are appealing the decision. Generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. We have received challenges in a number of other countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and several smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers challenge, but we anticipate further legal challenges from generic manufacturers. In the U.K., a trial date has tentatively been set for July 2008. We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents on a country by country basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The availability of generic olanzapine in Canada and Germany will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. The availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held in August 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. In June 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) commenced a reexamination of the patent, and in August 2007 took the position that the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In September 2007, the Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariads claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a 2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We plan to appeal this judgment. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. Government Investigations and Related Litigation In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In November 2007, we received a grand jury subpoena from the EDPA for a broad range of documents related to Zyprexa. A number of State Medicaid Fraud Control Units are coordinating with the EDPA in its investigation of any Medicaid related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In October 2005, the EDPA advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of our Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. 36 In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney Generals Office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexas status on Californias formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health care providers. In February 2007, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, seeking production of documents and information relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa. Beginning in August 2006, we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws. Most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. We are aware that approximately 30 states are participating in this joint effort, and it is possible that additional states will join the investigation. These attorneys general are seeking a broad range of Zyprexa documents, including documents relating to sales, marketing and promotional practices, and remuneration of health care providers. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in a private suit in California State Court, which was removed to federal court, alleging violations of the California False Claims Act with respect to certain Zyprexa marketing and promotional practices. This suit was brought by an individual on behalf of the government, under the qui tam provision of the California False Claims Act. We are cooperating in each of these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations. It is possible that other Lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of health care professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations. Product Liability and Related Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the claims) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 31,200 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during 2005. The January 2007 settlements were paid during 2007. 37 We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 325 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 1,235 plaintiffs. Trial dates have been set for June 23, 2008, in the Eastern District of New York, for several of the U.S. plaintiffs. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes all Canadian residents, except for residents of Quebec and British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S. We have insurance coverage for a portion of our Zyprexa product liability claims exposure. The third party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies. The dispute was the subject of litigation in the federal court in Indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in Bermuda against other carriers. In the second half of 2007, we reached settlements resolving the vast majority of the disputed insurance claims, and a portion of the insurance proceeds were paid to us prior to the end of 2007. Since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product liability matters. The net charges, which take into account our actual and expected insurance recoveries, covered the following: The cost of the Zyprexa product liability settlements to date; and Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the known Zyprexa product liability claims and expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa related illnesses. We have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in the courts of the respective states. The Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. The Alaska case is scheduled for trial beginning March 3, 2008. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on similar grounds. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. 38 Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely self insured for future product liability losses. In addition, as noted above, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.
