Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Review of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late stage pipeline developments, significant business development, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 9 percent, which was primarily driven by volume increases in several key products. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as sales, driven by pre launch activities associated with prasugrel, marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased litigation related expenses; while our investment in research and development grew 10 percent. We completed our acquisition of ImClone Systems Inc. (ImClone), resulting in a significant charge of $4.69 billion for acquired in process research and development (IPRD) and reached resolution on government investigations related to our past U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, resulting in an additional charge of $1.48 billion. We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million, despite a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion, primarily caused by the non deductibility of the ImClone IPRD charge and the partial deductibility of the Zyprexa investigation settlements. Accordingly, earnings decreased $5.02 billion, to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and earnings per share decreased $4.60, to a loss of $1.89 per share, in 2008 as compared with net income of $2.95 billion, or earnings per share of $2.71 in 2007. Net income comparisons between 2008 and 2007 are affected by the impact of the following significant items (see Notes 3, 5, 12, and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2008 Acquisitions (Note 3) We recognized charges totaling $4.73 billion (pretax) associated with the acquisition of ImClone, which decreased earnings per share by $4.46. These amounts include an IPRD charge of $4.69 billion (pretax). The remaining net expenses are related to ImClones operating results subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux. We also incurred IPRD charges of $28.0 million (pretax) associated with the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. We incurred IPRD charges associated with licensing arrangements with BioMS Medical Corp. (BioMS) and TransPharma Medical Ltd. totaling $122.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.07. 19 Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges totaling $497.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.30. A similar charge of $57.1 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.04, was included in cost of sales. These charges were primarily associated with the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana site, the termination of the AIR Insulin program, and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations. We recorded charges of $1.48 billion (pretax) related to the federal and state Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA), as well as the resolution of a multi state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of Columbia, which decreased earnings per share by $1.20. Other (Note 12) We recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, which increased earnings per share by $.19. 2007 Acquisitions (Note 3) We incurred IPRD charges associated with the acquisitions of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), and Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), totaling $631.6 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.57. We incurred IPRD charges associated with our licensing arrangements with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India, MacroGenics, Inc., and OSI Pharmaceuticals, totaling $114.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.06. 20 Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $190.6 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.12. These charges were primarily associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities. We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over Zyprexa product liability claims, which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries, and other product liability charges. This resulted in a charge totaling $111.9 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.09. Late Stage Pipeline Developments and Business Development Activity Our long term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotech nology or pharmaceutical companies. There were a number of late stage pipeline developments and business development transactions within the past year, including: Pipeline We, along with our partner Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, are seeking from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for prasugrel as a treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome being managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. The Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA reviewed prasugrel during a hearing and unanimously recommended it for approval. The FDA will consider the recommendation as it continues its review and makes its final decision. Prasugrel was approved for marketing by the European Commission under the trade name Efient in February 2009 for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We received a complete response letter from the FDA for olanzapine long acting injection (LAI) for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. We are continuing to work with the agency on the new drug application (NDA). The FDA does not require any additional clinical trials for the continued review of the NDA. Per the agencys request, we are preparing a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which will be submitted in the near future. In addition, olanzapine long acting injection was approved by the European Commission under the trade name Zypadheratm. We withdrew our supplemental NDA from the FDA for Cymbalta for the management of chronic pain. We plan to resubmit the application in the first half of 2009, adding data from a recently completed study in chronic osteoarthritis pain of the knee. The FDA approved Alimta, in combination with cisplatin, as a first line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with nonsquamous histology. The European health authorities also approved Alimta, in combination with cisplatin, as a first line treatment for non small cell lung cancer patients with other than predominantly squamous cell histology. We submitted tadalafil as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The FDA approved Cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder. In addition, the European Commission approved Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We, along with our partner Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin), submitted Byetta as a monotherapy treatment for type 2 diabetes to the FDA. The European Commission approved a new indication for Forsteo for the treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained, systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and men at increased risk for fracture. We have also received an approvable letter from the FDA for Forteo for the same indication. 21 We terminated development of our AIR Insulin program, which was being conducted in collaboration with Alkermes, Inc. The program had been in Phase III clinical development as a potential treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This decision was not a result of any observations during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of the product, but rather was a result of increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment and a thorough evaluation of the evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies. Business Development We acquired all of the outstanding shares of ImClone for a total purchase price of approximately $6.5 billion. This strategic combination will offer both targeted therapies and oncolytic agents along with an oncology pipeline spanning all phases of clinical development. It also expands our biotechnology capabilities. We entered into a license and a supply arrangement with United Therapeutics Corporation related to the U.S. commercialization rights for the PAH indication of tadalafil. We received an upfront payment of $150.0 million in exchange for exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for PAH in the U.S., as well as for a product manufacturing and supply arrangement. As part of this arrangement, we acquired a $150.0 million equity position in the company. The indication is currently under review by the FDA. We acquired the worldwide rights to the dairy cow supplement Posilac, as well as the products supporting operations, from Monsanto Company (Monsanto) for an upfront payment of $300.0 million, as well as contingent consideration based on future Posilac sales. The acquisition of Posilac provides us with a product that complements those of our animal health product line. We sold our Greenfield Laboratories site in Greenfield, Indiana, to Covance Inc. We also signed a 10 year service agreement, under which Covance will assume responsibility for our toxicology testing and other RD support activities at the site. We acquired SGX for approximately $64 million in cash. The acquisition allows us to integrate SGXs structure guided drug discovery platform into our drug discovery efforts. It also gives us access to FASTtm, SGXs fragment based, protein structure guided drug discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology compounds focused on a number of kinase targets. We entered into a licensing and development agreement with TransPharma Medical Ltd. (TransPharma) to acquire rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the treatment of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered transdermally using TransPharmas proprietary technology, is currently in Phase II clinical testing. We entered into an agreement with an affiliate of TPG Axon Capital (TPG) for the Phase III development of our two lead molecules for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. This agreement provides TPG with success based milestones and royalties in exchange for clinical trial funding. We entered into a licensing and development agreement with BioMS whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple sclerosis (MS) compound. The compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials in secondary progressive MS. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorneys office for the EDPA that it had commenced an investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In October 2008, we announced that we were in advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the EDPA, and we recorded a charge of $1.42 billion. In January 2009, we announced that the discussions had been successfully concluded, and that we settled the Zyprexa related federal claims, as well as similar Medicaid related claims of states which decide to participate in the settlement. Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws seeking documents pertaining to Zyprexa. In 22 October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia, under which we paid $62.0 million. In December 2008, the Federal Supreme Court (BGH) in Germany re established our Zyprexa patent that had been declared invalid in 2007 by the German Federal Patent Court. As a result of this ruling, generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the German market as of the beginning of 2009. We continue to reach agreements with claimants attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle claims against us relating to the medication. Approximately 120 claims remain. In the third quarter of 2008, we initiated a strategic review of our Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana. Options being considered for this site include continuing operations with a revised site mission, exploring opportunities to sell the facility, and ceasing operations altogether. The review is expected to last six to twelve months. No final decisions have been made at this time; however, depending on the decision, we could record significant charges. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) continues to provide an effective prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program (known as Medicare Part D). Various measures have been discussed and or passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products, including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to Medicaid patients or impose additional rebates on sales to patients who receive their medicines through Medicare Part D. Uncertainty exists surrounding the new administration and Congress and the impact any government decisions or programs will have on the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, many states are facing substantial budget difficulties due to the downturn in the economy and are expected to seek aggressive cuts or other offsets in healthcare spending. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2008 compared with 2007: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, Percent December 31, 2008 2007 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2007 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,202.5 $ 2,493.6 $ 4,696.1 $ 4,761.0 (1 ) Cymbalta 2,253.8 443.3 2,697.1 2,102.9 28 Humalog 1,008.4 727.4 1,735.8 1,474.6 18 Gemzar 734.8 985.0 1,719.8 1,592.4 8 Cialis2 539.0 905.5 1,444.5 1,143.8 26 Alimta 561.9 592.8 1,154.7 854.0 35 Animal health products 537.3 556.0 1,093.3 995.8 10 Evista 700.5 375.1 1,075.6 1,090.7 (1 ) Humulin 380.9 682.3 1,063.2 985.2 8 Forteo 489.9 288.8 778.7 709.3 10 Strattera 437.8 141.7 579.5 569.4 2 Other pharmaceutical products 1,087.6 1,252.1 2,339.7 2,354.4 (1 ) Total net sales $ 10,934.4 $ 9,443.6 $ 20,378.0 $ 18,633.5 9 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 23 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS in late January 2007, the Cialis sales shown do not include sales in the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales for January 2007, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other net in our consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net sales. Worldwide 2008 sales for Cialis grew 19 percent from 2007 sales of $1.22 billion. OPERATING RESULTS 2008 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2008 increased 9 percent, to $20.38 billion, driven primarily by growth of Cymbalta, Cialis, Alimta, Humalog, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales volume increased 5 percent, while foreign exchange rates contributed 3 percent, and selling prices contributed 2 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $10.93 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $9.44 billion, driven primarily by the sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, and Humalog. Zyprexa, our top selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 1 percent in 2008, driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased demand and to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Germany and Canada. As noted previously, generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the German market as of the beginning of 2009. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased 23 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 66 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Higher demand outside the U.S. reflects increased demand in established markets as well as recent launches in new markets. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 24 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 24 Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. We will likely face increased generic competition in certain markets outside the U.S. in 2009. Our sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, increased 27 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 26 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Total worldwide sales of Cialis increased 19 percent to $1.44 billion in 2008 as compared to $1.22 billion in 2007. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 46 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by lower demand and lower prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. As described in Legal and Regulatory Matters, Evista is the subject of a Hatch Waxman patent challenge by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), which has received tentative approval of its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) from the FDA. Unless the current stay on Tevas approved ANDA remains in force or Teva is preliminarily enjoined from markets if the stay is lifted, it is possible that Teva could choose to launch before the current action against Teva is concluded. Such a launch could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 35 percent, driven primarily by increased demand. Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin, increased 16 percent to $751.4 million during 2008. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byettas gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues increased 20 percent to $396.1 million in 2008. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the inclusion of U.S. Posilac sales since the date of acquisition. Sales outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2008 gross margin increased to 78.5 percent of sales compared with 77.2 percent for 2007. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 25 Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2008, to $6.63 billion. This increase was due to increased marketing and selling expenses, including prelaunch expenses for prasugrel and marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista; the impact of foreign exchange rates; and increased litigation related expenses. Investment in research and development increased 10 percent, to $3.84 billion, due to increased late stage clinical trial and discovery research costs. Acquired IPRD charges related to the acquisitions of ImClone and SGX, as well as our in licensing arrangements with BioMS and TransPharma, were $4.84 billion in 2008 as compared to $745.6 million in 26 2007. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $1.97 billion in 2008, as compared to $302.5 million in 2007. The 2008 charges were primarily associated with the resolution of Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA and multiple states. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other net decreased $148.1 million, to a net expense of $26.1 million. This line item consists of interest expense, interest income, the after tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. Interest expense for 2008 was essentially flat at $228.3 million. The impact of lower interest rates on our debt was substantially offset by lower capitalized interest due to lower construction in progress balances and increased interest expense due to the financing of the ImClone acquisition. Interest income for 2008 decreased $4.6 million, to $210.7 million, as lower interest rates were partially offset by higher cash balances. The Lilly ICOS joint venture income prior to the 2007 acquisition was $11.0 million. Subsequent to the acquisition, all activity related to ICOS is included in our consolidated financial results. Net other miscellaneous items decreased $132.5 million to a loss of $8.5 million, primarily as a result of lower outlicensing income and increased net losses on investment securities in 2008 (the majority of which consisted of unrealized losses). We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPRD charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements. The IPRD charge was not tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of the IRS audit. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent in 2007. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. OPERATING RESULTS 2007 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 19 percent. This growth was primarily driven by volume increases in a number of key products, with a significant portion of this increase in volume resulting from the acquisition of ICOS. Our additional investments in marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, contributed to this sales growth and enabled us to increase our investment in research and development 11 percent in 2007. While cost of sales and operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the same rate as sales, other net decreased and the effective tax rate increased. As a result, net income and earnings per share increased 11 percent, to $2.95 billion, or $2.71 per share, in 2007 as compared with $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006. Net income comparisons between 2007 and 2006 are affected by the impact of significant items that are reflected in our financial results. The significant items for 2007 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2006 items are summarized as follows (see Notes 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 5). In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 5 and 14). Sales Our worldwide sales for 2007 increased 19 percent, to $18.63 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis since our January 29, 2007 acquisition of ICOS and sales growth of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Humalog. Worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent, while selling prices and foreign 27 exchange rates each increased sales by 3 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, to $10.15 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, and Byetta, and the inclusion of Cialis. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, to $8.49 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis, and sales growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Cymbalta. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2007 compared with 2006: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2006 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,236.0 $ 2,525.0 $ 4,761.0 $ 4,363.6 9 Cymbalta 1,835.6 267.3 2,102.9 1,316.4 60 Gemzar 670.0 922.4 1,592.4 1,408.1 13 Humalog 888.0 586.6 1,474.6 1,299.5 13 Cialis2 423.8 720.0 1,143.8 215.8 NM Evista 706.1 384.6 1,090.7 1,045.3 4 Animal health products 480.9 514.9 995.8 875.5 14 Humulin 365.2 620.0 985.2 925.3 6 Alimta 448.0 406.0 854.0 611.8 40 Forteo 494.1 215.2 709.3 594.3 19 Strattera 464.6 104.8 569.4 579.0 (2 ) Humatrope 213.6 227.2 440.8 415.6 6 Actos 150.8 219.8 370.6 448.5 (17 ) Byetta 316.5 14.2 330.7 219.0 51 Other pharmaceutical products 452.3 760.0 1,212.3 1,373.3 (12 ) Total net sales $ 10,145.5 $ 8,488.0 $ 18,633.5 $ 15,691.0 19 NM Not meaningful 1 U.S sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS, the Cialis sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other net in our consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net sales. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2007, driven by higher net selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Cymbalta increased 58 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by strong demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 70 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humalog increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declining prices. Total worldwide sales of Cialis were $1.22 billion and $971.0 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Worldwide sales grew 25 percent in 2007. U.S. sales increased 20 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 28 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices. 28 Sales of Evista increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and lower demand. Sales of Humulin decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Alimta increased 28 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 55 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo increased 19 percent in the U.S., driven by higher net selling prices. U.S. sales growth benefited from access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 21 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera decreased 9 percent in the U.S., as a result of decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Our revenues from Actos decreased 46 percent in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. increased 30 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide sales of Byetta increased 51 percent to $650.2 million during 2007. Our revenues increased 51 percent to $330.7 million in 2007. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, driven by increased demand, the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, and new companion animal product launches. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2007 gross margin decreased to 77.2 percent of sales compared with 77.4 percent for 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales, offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses) increased 19 percent in 2007. Investment in research and development increased 11 percent, to $3.49 billion. In addition to the acquisition of ICOS, this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late stage clinical trial costs. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2007, to $6.10 billion. This increase was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Acquired IPRD charges were $745.6 million in 2007 and related to the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion, and Ivy, as well as our licensing arrangements with OSI, MacroGenics, and Glenmark. We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $302.5 million in 2007 as compared to $945.2 million in 2006. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other net decreased $115.8 million, to income of $122.0 million. This line item consists of interest expense, interest income, the after tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. Interest expense for 2007 decreased $9.8 million, to $228.3 million. This decrease is a result of lower average debt balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest income for 2007 decreased $46.6 million, to $215.3 million, due to lower cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006. 29 The Lilly ICOS joint venture income was $11.0 million in 2007 as compared to $96.3 million in 2006, due to the acquisition of ICOS on January 29, 2007. Net other miscellaneous income items increased $6.3 million to $124.0 million. We incurred tax expense of $923.8 million in 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent, compared with 22.1 percent for 2006. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were affected primarily by the nondeductible ICOS and Hypnion IPRD charges of $594.6 million in 2007, and the product liability charges of $494.9 million in 2006. The tax effect of the product liability charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $5.93 billion compared with $4.83 billion at December 31, 2007. Cash flow from operations in 2008 of $7.30 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $4.41 billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of $6.08 billion, dividends paid of $2.06 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $947.2 million, and net purchases of noncurrent investments of $815.1 million. Capital expenditures of $947.2 million during 2008 were $135.2 million less than in 2007. We expect 2009 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities, continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt as of December 31, 2008 increased $5.45 billion, to $10.46 billion, reflecting the commercial paper we issued in November 2008 primarily to finance our acquisition of ImClone, offset by long term debt repayments and paydown of commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our current debt ratings from Standard Poors and Moodys are at AA and A1, respectively. Dividends of $1.88 per share were paid in 2008, an increase of 11 percent from 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, effective for the first quarter dividend in 2009, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.49 per share (a 4.3 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2009 of $1.96 per share. The year 2008 was the 30 124th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 41st consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. In recent months, global economic conditions have deteriorated. Triggered by the liquidity crisis in the capital markets, the implications have become more widespread, resulting in higher unemployment and declines in real consumer spending. In addition, many financial institutions have tightened lines of credit, reducing funding available for near term economic growth. Pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns; however, an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding with the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the U.S. In addition, both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care, including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs. We continue to monitor the potential near term impact of prescription trends, the credit worthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers, the decline of health insurance coverage in the overall population, and the federal governments involvement in the economic crisis. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government investigations, and dividends in 2009. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market because of the high credit quality of our short and long term debt. In 2009, we intend to fund payments required in connection with the EDPA settlements, and to further reduce outstanding commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations, and the issuance of longterm debt. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Additionally, in November 2008, we obtained a one year short term revolving credit facility in the amount of $4.00 billion as back up, alternative financing. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2009 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. 31 In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2008 and 2007, including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a one year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, 32 results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt, including interest payments1 $ 8,205.5 $ 595.8 $ 387.0 $ 881.2 $ 6,341.5 Capital lease obligations 41.3 13.1 17.0 5.2 6.0 Operating leases 335.3 90.8 141.4 73.6 29.5 Purchase obligations2 7,923.0 5,976.3 723.5 388.5 834.7 Other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 1,088.8 316.7 185.0 587.1 Other4 157.1 157.1 Total $ 17,751.0 $ 6,833.1 $ 1,585.6 $ 1,533.5 $ 7,798.8 1 Our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2008 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2008. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $906.2 million, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2008. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. 33 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales, which are outside the U.S., are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns. We establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Consistent with SFAS 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. Actual product returns have been approximately one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related 34 to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $1.03 billion, $738.8 million, and $704.8 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2008 would lead to an approximate $52 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2008, our sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was $618.5 million. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 80 percent and 78 percent of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following represents a roll forward of our most significant U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2008 2007 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 693.5 $ 614.5 Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates1 1,864.9 1,404.0 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,751.8 ) (1,325.0 ) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 806.5 $ 693.5 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 0.1 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. 35 The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 88 percent to 92 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2008 annual expense would increase by approximately $27 million. A one percentage point decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2008 service cost and interest cost by approximately $21 million. If the 2008 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $26 million. If the 2008 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $17 million. If our assumption regarding the 2008 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately $28 million. The U.S. plans represent approximately 83 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 84 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2008. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the assets net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require managements judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the 36 position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $43.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2009 For the full year of 2009, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.25. We expect volume growth in sales again in 2009, driven by Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis, Humalog, and the anticipated launches of prasugrel, as well as by the Elanco animal health division. However, the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies, worldwide pricing pressures, and the impact of generic competition in certain markets for Gemzar are anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts. As a result, we expect mid single digit sales growth. We expect gross margin as a percent of net sales to increase, driven by the strengthening dollar. This increase could be more pronounced in the first half of 2009. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to show flat to low single digit growth. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low double digits. Other net is expected to be a net loss of between $200 million and $250 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect continued strong operating cash flow. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. 37 Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): Cymbalta: Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted ANDAs seeking permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege non infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation, and eight allege invalidity of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the eight challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia, and one alleges the patent having claims directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable. Lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Activis Elizabeth LLC; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; Sun Pharma Global, Inc.; and Wockhardt Limited, seeking rulings that the patents are valid, infringed, and enforceable. Answers to the complaints are pending. Gemzar: Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and method of use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Sicor (February 2006) and Mayne (October 2006 and January 2008), seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being infringed. The suit against Sicor has been scheduled for trial in July 2009. Sicors ANDAs have been approved by the FDA; however, Sicor must provide 90 days notice prior to marketing generic Gemzar to allow time for us to seek a preliminary injunction. Both suits against Mayne have been administratively closed, and the parties have agreed to be bound by the results of the Sicor suit. In November 2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking rulings that our method of use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the sale of Suns generic product. This trial is scheduled for December 2009. Alimta: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva) and APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and alleging the patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva and APP, seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. Trial is scheduled for November 8, 2010. Evista: Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) submitted an ANDA in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2012 2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a similar lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is currently scheduled for trial beginning March 9, 2009, while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Barr. In April 2008, the FDA granted Teva tentative approval of its ANDA, but Tevas ability to market a generic product is subject to a statutory stay, which has been extended to expire on March 9, 2009. If the stay expires and the company cannot obtain preliminary relief from the court, Teva can launch its generic product, regardless of the status of the current litigation, but subject to our right to recover damages, should we prevail at trial. We believe each of these Hatch Waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. 38 We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the U.S.: In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method of use patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We sued Novopharm for patent infringement, and the trial began in November 2008. We expect the trial to run through the first quarter of 2009, with a decision in the second half of 2009. In November 2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of our Zyprexa compound and method of use patents, and no trial date has been set. We have brought similar actions against Pharmascience (August 2007), Sandoz (July 2007), Nu Pharm (June 2008), Genpharm (June 2008) and Cobalt (January 2009); none of these suits has been scheduled for trial. Pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of the Novopharm suit, and, pending the outcome of the lawsuit, we have agreed not to take any further steps to prevent the company from coming to market with generic olanzapine tablets, subject to a contingent damages obligation should we be successful against Novopharm. In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Egis Gyogyszergyar and Neolab Ltd. challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method of use patent (expiring in 2011). In June 2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. Generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. We appealed the decision to the German Federal Supreme Court and following a hearing in December 2008, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Patent Court and found the patent to be valid. Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic companies either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to preliminary injunction. We are pursuing these companies for damages arising from infringement. We have received challenges in a number of other countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, and several smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers challenges, but further legal challenge is now pending before the Commercial Court in Madrid. In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer Dr. Reddys Laboratories (UK) Limited has challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method of use patent (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents Court in the High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid. Dr. Reddys appealed this decision, and a hearing date for the appeal has not been set. We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents on a country by country basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. Xigris and Evista: In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held in August 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. In June 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) commenced a reexamination of the patent, and in August 2007 took the position that the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In September 2007, the Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariads claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a 2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We have appealed this 39 judgment. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal on February 6, 2009. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. Government Investigations and Related Litigation In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In addition, the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than 30 states coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation of any Medicaid related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In January 2009, we announced that we reached resolution of this matter. As part of the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and agreed to pay $615.0 million. The misdemeanor plea is for the off label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimers dementia, between September 1999 and March 2001. We have also entered into a settlement agreement resolving the federal civil claims, under which we will pay approximately $438.0 million, although we do not admit to the allegations. We have also agreed to settle the civil investigations brought by the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of the states that have coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation, and will make available a maximum amount of approximately $362.0 million for payment to those states that agree to settle. The charge we recorded for this matter in the third quarter of $1.42 billion will be sufficient to cover these payments. Also, as part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This agreement will require us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also provides for an independent third party review organization to assess and report on the companys systems, processes, policies, procedures and practices. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney Generals Office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexas status on Californias formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health care providers. We expect these matters to be resolved if Florida and California participate in the state component of the EDPA resolution. Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws. Most of these requests became part of a multistate investigative effort coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. In October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia. While there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted, we paid $62.0 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed in the settling states. The 32 states participating in the settlement are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Product Liability and Related Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the claims) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the 40 federal lawsuits are part of a Multi District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during 2005. The January 2007 settlements were paid during 2007. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 105 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 120 plaintiffs, of which about 80 cases covering about 90 plaintiffs are part of the MDL. No trials have been scheduled related to these claims. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S. Since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product liability matters. The net charges, which take into account our actual insurance recoveries, covered the following: The cost of the Zyprexa product liability settlements to date; and Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the known Zyprexa product liability claims and expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY). In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa related illnesses. We have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in the courts of the respective states. The Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings in the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March 2008 for a payment of $15.0 million, plus terms designed to ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. The following cases have been set for trial in 2009: Connecticut in the EDNY in June, Pennsylvania in November, and South Carolina in August, in their respective states. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September 41 2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of third party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinsteins order denying our motion for summary judgment, in September 2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in October 2009. We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future.
