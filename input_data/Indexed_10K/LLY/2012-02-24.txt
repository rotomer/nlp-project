Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 5 percent in 2011, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Cymbalta, insulin products, animal health products, Alimta, Effient, and Cialis, offset by the decline in Gemzar and Zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity. This revenue growth, as well as a lower effective tax rate, was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage; increased marketing, selling, and administrative costs; higher other expense; and the increased impact in 2011 of the items noted below. As a result, net income decreased 14 percent to $4.35 billion, and earnings per share decreased 15 percent to $3.90 per share, in 2011 as compared to $5.07 billion, or $4.58 per share, in 2010. 2011 U.S. Health Care Reform As a result of higher rebates and subsidies included in health care reform enacted in the U.S. during 2010, total revenue in 2011 was reduced by $408.8 million (pretax), or $.29 per share. Also, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $178.0 million (pretax), or $.16 per share, as a result of the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee. Collaborations (Note 4) We incurred acquired in process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim of $388.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.23. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Note 5) We recognized restructuring charges of $316.4 million (pretax), or $.24 per share, primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. We incurred a charge of $85.0 million (pretax), or approximately $.05 per share, in 2011 primarily for returned product and contractual commitments related to the withdrawal of Xigris. 2010 U.S. Health Care Reform As a result of higher rebates included in health care reform enacted in the U.S. during 2010, total revenue in 2010 was reduced by $229.0 million (pretax), or $.16 per share. We also recorded a one time non cash deferred income tax charge in the first quarter of $85.1 million, or $.08 per share, associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our U.S. retiree health plan. Acquisitions (Note 3) We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with the in licensing arrangement with Acrux Limited (Acrux) of $50.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Note 5) We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million (pretax), or $.13 per share, primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions. Late Stage Pipeline Our long term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 65 potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical research. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) and the introduction of new products. A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 17 $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Delays and uncertainties in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products. We manage R&D spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total R&D spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the R&D process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our R&D projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful R&D project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated R&D expense. While we do accumulate certain R&D costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total R&D costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. The following new molecular entities (NMEs) are currently in Phase III clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described. The quarter in which the NME initially entered Phase III for any indication is shown in parentheses: Dulaglutide* (Q3 2008) a glucagon like peptide 1 analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes Edivoxetine (Q4 2010) a norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of major depression Empagliflozin BI10773 (Q3 2010) a sodium glucose co transporter (SGLT 2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Enzastaurin (Q1 2006) a small molecule for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma Ixekizumab formerly IL 17 MAb* (Q4 2011) a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis Necitumumab* (Q4 2009) a fully human monoclonal antibody for the treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb) New insulin glargine product formerly LY2963016 (Q3 2011) a new insulin glargine product for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Novel basal insulin analog* (Q4 2011) a novel basal insulin for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Pomaglumetad Methionil (Q1 2011) a metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu 2/3) receptor agonist for the treatment of schizophrenia Ramucirumab* (Q4 2009) a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of metastatic breast, gastric, liver, NSCLC, and colorectal cancers Solanezumab* (Q2 2009) an amyloid beta (A&szlig;) antibody for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. Tabalumab formerly BAFF MAb* (Q4 2010) an anti BAFF monoclonal antibody for the treatment of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis * Biologic molecule subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act The following NMEs have been submitted for regulatory review for potential use in the disease described. The quarter the NME initially was submitted for any indication is shown in parentheses: Florbetapir (Q3 2010) a molecular imaging tool for the detection of beta amyloid plaque in the brain Liprotamase (Q1 2010) a non porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The following late stage pipeline developments have occurred since January 1, 2011: Arxxant In December, we completed and evaluated the final clinical trial for Arxxant, the EYES study, which did not meet the primary study endpoint. We have opted not to re submit Arxxant to the FDA for diabetic retinopathy. Bydureon In June, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Bydureon, the first once weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes in combination with certain oral therapies. European launches began in the third quarter of 2011, starting with the United Kingdom and Germany. In January 2012, the FDA approved Bydureon as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. We and Amylin terminated the collaboration in November 2011; refer to Note 4 of the Financial Statements for additional information. Florbetapir In March, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for the New Drug Application (NDA) for Amyvid (florbetapir) that was primarily focused on the need to establish a reader training program for market implementation that helps to ensure reader accuracy and consistency of interpretations of existing Amyvid scans. We submitted our response to the FDAs complete response letter. Ixekizumab In November, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for ixekizumab. 18 Linagliptin and Empagliflozin In January 2011, we announced a global agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (Boehringer) to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes compounds currently in mid and late stage development, including Boehringers two investigational oral diabetes agents, linagliptin and empagliflozin. In 2011, linagliptin was approved and launched in the U.S. (trade name Tradjenta), Japan (trade name Trazenta), Europe (trade name Trajenta&reg;), and other countries. In January 2012, the FDA approved Jentadueto, a combination of linagliptin and metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Liprotamase In April, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for the NDA for liprotamase that communicated the need for us to conduct an additional clinical trial prior to a re submission. We are currently finalizing the study design and anticipate starting a clinical study in 2012. Necitumumab In February 2011, we and Bristol Myers Squibb Company stopped enrollment in one of the two global Phase III studies. The decision to stop enrollment in the Phase III non squamous NSCLC INSPIRE trial (combination treatment with Alimta) followed an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism (blood clots) in the experimental arm of the study. The second Phase III study in squamous NSCLC looking at the combination use of necitumumab with Gemzar is continuing. New insulin glargine product In September, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for our new insulin glargine product. Novel basal insulin analog In November, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for our novel basal insulin analog. Pomaglumetad Methionil In February 2011, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for pomaglumetad methionil. Solanezumab In January 2012, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that we continue the two ongoing Phase III randomized pivotal trials for solanezumab without modifications, based on pre planned interim safety and futility analyses. The DMC also recommended that we make a protocol modification to EXPEDITION XT, the open label extension study of the two Phase III trials, making the protocol for the open label extension more consistent with the current protocol for the pivotal studies. Acquisition In February 2012, we acquired ChemGen Corp., a privately held bioscience company specializing in the development and commercialization of innovative feed enzyme products that improve the efficiency of poultry, egg, and meat production. The transaction is not material to our consolidated financial statements. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In October 2011, we announced the withdrawal of our Xigris [drotrecogin alfa (activated)] product in all markets following results of the PROWESS SHOCK study, which did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in 28 day all cause mortality in patients with septic shock. We incurred a charge of $85.0 million (pretax), or approximately $.05 per share, for product returns and contractual commitments related to Xigris. Revenue related to Xigris has not been material to our consolidated financial statements. The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 in March 2010 brought significant changes to U.S. health care. These changes began to affect our financial results in the first quarter of 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the PPACA. Oral arguments will take place in March 2012 and a decision is expected in the summer of 2012. Changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to Medicaid beneficiaries, which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent, became effective in the first quarter of 2010. This rebate has been expanded to managed Medicaid, a program that provides for the delivery of Medicaid benefits via managed care organizations, under arrangements between those organizations and state Medicaid agencies. Additionally, a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve low income and uninsured patients (known as 340B facilities) has been expanded. Beginning in 2011, drug manufacturers provided a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the doughnut hole (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). The doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020. Additionally, beginning in 2011, a non tax deductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. This fee is allocated to companies based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs. In 2011, we recorded $178.0 million related to this fee, which is included in marketing, selling, and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Also, there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers, such as us, who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for two more years, accounting rules dictated that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a one time non cash charge of $85.1 million upon enactment of the tax law change, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2010. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies revenue or increase 19 expenses may be enacted. Certain other federal and state health care proposals continue to be debated, and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. We also expect pricing pressures at state levels could become more severe. These federal and state proposals, or state price pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. The Obama Administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S. based companies. There also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the manner in which, and the rate at which, income of U.S. companies would be taxed. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for Congress and the Obama Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In October 2010, Puerto Rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations. This tax is included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations. We believe this tax should be creditable against our U.S. income taxes. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and several European countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures. We also anticipate an adverse effect from biennial pricing actions in Japan. There are proposals for cost containment measures pending in a number of additional countries, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. Such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries. OPERATING RESULTS 2011 Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2011 increased 5 percent, to $24.29 billion, driven by the collective growth of Cymbalta, insulin products, animal health products, Alimta, Effient, and Cialis, offset by the decline in Gemzar and Zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Worldwide sales volume increased 6 percent, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue growth, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower prices. The increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Zyprexa and Gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine. Revenue in the U.S. increased 1 percent, to $12.98 billion, due to higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $11.31 billion, due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. In 2011, total revenue was reduced by $408.8 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform. The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2011 compared with 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2011 Year Ended December 31, 2010Total Percent Changefrom 2010 Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total2 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,165.3 $ 2,456.7 $ 4,622.0 $ 5,026.4 (8 ) Cymbalta 3,173.4 988.4 4,161.8 3,459.2 20 Alimta 994.6 1,466.5 2,461.1 2,208.6 11 Humalog 1,398.9 968.7 2,367.6 2,054.2 15 Cialis 704.5 1,171.1 1,875.6 1,699.4 10 Animal health products 896.8 781.8 1,678.6 1,391.4 21 Humulin 588.1 660.7 1,248.8 1,088.9 15 Evista 707.5 359.4 1,066.9 1,024.4 4 Forteo 453.1 496.7 949.8 830.1 14 Strattera 392.2 227.9 620.1 576.7 8 Gemzar 70.6 381.5 452.1 1,149.4 (61 ) Other pharmaceutical products 879.4 1,221.0 2,100.4 1,933.5 9 Total net product sales 12,424.4 11,180.4 23,604.8 22,442.2 5 Collaboration and other revenue3 552.8 128.9 681.7 633.8 8 Total revenue $ 12,977.2 $ 11,309.3 $ 24,286.5 $ 23,076.0 5 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byettas gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 13 percent in 2011 due to the loss of patent exclusivity in 20 the U.S. on October 23, 2011. Despite a decline in demand for branded Zyprexa, U.S. volume increased in 2011 primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our six month agreement with Prasco Laboratories. This volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded Zyprexa and authorized olanzapine. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of Japan during 2011, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan. In the five major European countries, which in the aggregate had approximately $900 million in sales in 2011, we lost exclusivity in Spain in April 2011 and in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom in September 2011. Globally, upon loss of exclusivity, we are experiencing generic competition which is causing rapid and severe declines on our Zyprexa sales. In Japan, our second largest market with approximately $540 million in sales in 2011, our patent expires in December 2015. We anticipate worldwide sales of Zyprexa to decline by at least $3 billion in 2012. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 44 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 17 percent, due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We expect 2012 sales outside the U.S. to be negatively affected by significant government price reductions in Japan, which is our second largest market for Alimta, and the introduction of generic competition in certain markets. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 14 percent in the U.S., due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction (also approved in October 2011 for benign prostatic hyperplasia in the U.S.), increased 7 percent in the U.S., primarily due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices for Humulin and increased demand attributable to Humulin ReliOn. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, increased 4 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men, decreased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, primarily due to the increased demand in Japan. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and in the U.S. in adults, increased 1 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 22 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to treat various cancers, decreased 90 percent in the U.S., due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition, which began in November 2010, following the expiration of the compound patent. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 10 percent, due to generic competition in most major markets. We expect sales to continue to decline in 2012. We report as revenue for Erbitux, a product approved to treat various cancers, the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales. Our revenues increased 6 percent to $409.2 million in 2011. Prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with Amylin in November 2011, we recognized in revenue our 50 percent share of Byettas gross margin in the U.S. In December 2011, we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination arrangement. We will continue to recognize 100 percent of Byetta and Bydureon sales outside the U.S. until those markets transition to Amylin on a market by market basis over a period beginning no earlier than the second half of 2012 and that will not extend beyond December 31, 2013. We also recognize our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin which will continue until no later than the end of 2013. In 2011, we recognized total exenatide revenue of $422.7 million, a decrease of 2 percent. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 16 percent, due primarily to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 27 percent during 2011, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain Janssen and Pfizer animal health assets in Europe and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 21 Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses Gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 2.0 percentage points in 2011 to 79.1 percent. This decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which significantly increased cost of sales in 2011, but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in 2010. Patent expirations for Zyprexa and Gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2011 to $7.88 billion. The increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates. In addition, higher administrative expenses in the U.S. included $178.0 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $5.02 billion, due primarily to increased late stage clinical trial costs, including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $388.0 million in 2011, associated with our diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, compared with $50.0 million in 2010 associated with the in licensing agreement with Acrux. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $401.4 million in 2011, including charges of $316.4 million primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, and a special charge of $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In 2010, we recognized charges totaling $192.0 million for asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges. See Notes 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other net, expense increased $174.0 million to a net expense of $179.0 million in 2011, due primarily to the partial impairment of the acquired IPR&D assets related to liprotamase and Amyvid in 2011 and damages recovered in 2010 from generic pharmaceutical companies related to Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany. Our effective tax rate was 18.7 percent in 2011, compared with 22.3 percent in 2010. The decrease was due to the tax benefit on the IPR&D charge associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes collaboration, as well as a benefit of $85.3 million primarily from the resolution in 2011 of the IRS audits of tax years 2005 2007, along with certain matters related to 2008 2009. Additionally, the tax rate for 2010 was increased by a one time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of U.S. health care reform. OPERATING RESULTS 2010 Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 6 percent to $23.08 billion in 2010, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, animal health products, insulin products, Cialis, and Zyprexa, offset by a decline in Gemzar revenue. Cost of sales and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue, while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased. Net income increased 17 percent to $5.07 billion, and earnings per share increased 16 percent to $4.58 per share, in 2010, as compared to $4.33 billion, or $3.94 per share, in 2009. Net income comparisons between 2010 and 2009 are affected by the impact of several highlighted items. The highlighted items for 2010 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2009 highlighted items are summarized as follows: Acquisitions (Note 3) We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with an in licensing arrangement with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) of $90.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.05. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 15) We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $462.7 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29, for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site. We incurred pretax charges of $230.0 million in connection with the claims of several states related to Zyprexa, which decreased earnings per share by $.13. Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2010 increased 6 percent, to $23.08 billion, driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, animal health products, insulin products, Cialis, and Zyprexa, offset by a decline in Gemzar revenue. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent, while selling prices contributed 2 percent of revenue growth, and the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible. Revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent, to $12.87 billion, due to higher prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $10.21 billion, due to increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. In 2010, total revenue was reduced by $229.0 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform. 22 The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2010 compared with 2009: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Total Percent Change from 2010 Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total2 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,495.5 $ 2,530.9 $ 5,026.4 $ 4,915.7 2 Cymbalta 2,772.0 687.2 3,459.2 3,074.7 13 Alimta 957.1 1,251.5 2,208.6 1,706.0 29 Humalog 1,222.4 831.8 2,054.2 1,959.0 5 Cialis 658.1 1,041.4 1,699.4 1,559.1 9 Animal health products 775.1 616.3 1,391.4 1,207.2 15 Gemzar 723.3 426.1 1,149.4 1,363.2 (16 ) Humulin 470.8 618.0 1,088.9 1,022.0 7 Evista 681.8 342.6 1,024.4 1,030.4 (1 ) Forteo 499.0 331.0 830.1 816.7 2 Strattera 389.8 186.9 576.7 609.4 (5 ) Other pharmaceutical products 737.4 1,196.3 1,933.5 1,908.1 1 Total net product sales 12,382.3 10,060.0 22,442.2 21,171.5 6 Collaboration and other revenue3 483.3 150.4 633.8 664.5 (5 ) Total revenue $ 12,865.6 $ 10,210.4 $ 23,076.0 $ 21,836.0 6 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byettas gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 7 percent in 2010, driven by higher prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent driven by lower prices and decreased demand in Europe and Canada, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan. Sales of Cymbalta increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent, driven primarily by increased demand in Japan, Europe, and Canada. Sales of Alimta increased 17 percent in the U.S., due primarily to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 41 percent, due to increased demand. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably affected by continued strong growth in Japan. Sales of Humalog increased 1 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices, partially offset by the impact of wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand primarily in Japan and China. Sales of Cialis increased 6 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due primarily to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales of Gemzar decreased 3 percent in the U.S., due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition, which began in November 2010, following the expiration of the compound patent. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 31 percent, due primarily to generic competition in most major markets. Sales of Humulin increased 17 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. remained essentially flat when compared to 2009, due to lower prices offset by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista remained essentially flat in the U.S., due to decreased demand offset by increased prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by lower prices and lower demand, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo decreased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales of Strattera decreased 13 percent in the U.S., due primarily to lower demand, and to a lesser extent, lower net effective selling prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 14 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. Worldwide sales of Byetta decreased 11 percent to $710.2 million during 2010 due to competitive pressures in the U.S. and European markets. Our revenues decreased 4 percent to $430.6 million in 2010. Erbitux revenues were $386.1 million in 2010, compared with $390.8 million in 2009. Animal health product sales in the U.S. and outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, due primarily to increased demand for our companion animal and feed additive products. 23 Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2010 to 81.1 percent. This increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2010 to $7.05 billion. The increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and company wide cost containment efforts. Investment in research and development increased 13 percent, to $4.88 billion, due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules, including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $50.0 million in 2010, associated with the in licensing agreement with Acrux, compared with $90.0 million in 2009 resulting from the in licensing agreement with Incyte. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million in 2010, primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. In 2009, we recognized charges totaling $692.7 million for asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges. See Notes 3, 5, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other net, expense improved $224.5 million to a net expense of $5.0 million in 2010, due primarily to net gains on equity investments, lower net interest expense, damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at our Enfield, Connecticut, distribution center. The effective tax rate was 22.3 percent for 2010, compared with 19.2 percent for 2009. The 2010 increase was driven by $85.1 million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to U.S. health care reform. The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2011, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $6.90 billion compared with $6.73 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of $7.23 billion, partially offset by net noncurrent investment activity (as cash was invested with maturities greater than one year) of $2.32 billion, dividends paid of $2.18 billion, business and product acquisitions of $1.33 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $672.0 million. Capital expenditures of $672.0 million during 2011 were $22.3 million less than in 2010. We expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $800 million as we invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality, productivity, and capability of our manufacturing, research, and development facilities. Total debt at December 31, 2011, was $6.99 billion, an increase of $60.5 million from December 31, 2010, which was due primarily to the $252.4 million increase in the fair value of hedged debt offset by the full repayment in 2011 of $125.0 million of short term floating rate debt and $63.7 million in Employee Stock Ownership Plan debentures. In 2012, we plan to retire $1.51 billion of our debt as it matures. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys remain AA and A2, respectively. Our ratings outlook from both Moodys and Standard & Poors is stable. Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in 2011 and 2010. 2011 was the 127th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments. In the fourth quarter of 2011, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2012, the quarterly dividend was maintained at $.49 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2012 of $1.96 per share. As of the fourth quarter of 2011, the U.S. economy continues to recover while concerns have grown regarding the health of the European economy. Worries in Europe have spread beyond the peripheral nations to encompass the entirety of the euro area, with many economists believing a recession in the euro area to be probable. Meanwhile, U.S. economic data in the fourth quarter generally exceeded expectations, with housing and employment indicators signaling a strengthening recovery. Still, given the fragility of the economic recovery and the heightened anxiety regarding Europe, the Federal Reserve has maintained its view that accommodative policy is likely to be warranted through 2014. Both domestically and abroad, high sovereign debt levels, sluggish growth, rating downgrades, and ongoing fiscal deficits have spurred efforts at fiscal austerity, notably in Spain, Italy, and Greece. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation; the federal governments involvement in the U.S. economy; and various international government funding levels. Currently, we believe economic conditions in Europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, and dividends in 2012. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings. Because of the high credit quality of our short and long term debt, our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Financial Expectations for 2012 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. 24 We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. Through 2014, we expect to lose U.S. patent protection for Cymbalta (June 2013) and Evista (March 2014) . Cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity, based on completion of pediatric studies. Zyprexa and Gemzar have already lost exclusivity in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Gemzar lost exclusivity in November 2010 and Zyprexa lost exclusivity in October 2011. In addition, we face U.S. patent litigation over Alimta, and it is possible we could lose our exclusivity prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. Refer to the Hatch Waxman patent litigation discussion in Note 15 and in the Legal and Regulatory Matters section below. The loss of exclusivity for Alimta, Cymbalta, or Evista would likely result in generic competition, generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. patent for Humalog expires in May 2013. Humalog is currently protected in Europe only by formulation patents. We do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for Humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. To date, no company has received approval to market a biosimilar version of Humalog; however, it is difficult to predict the likelihood and impact of biosimilars entering the market. Our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations, liquidity, and financial position through growth in our patent protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period, in emerging markets, in Japan, and in our animal health business. Our expected growth in the emerging markets and Japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of new products in these markets. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2011 and 2010, including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen). Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. 25 Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Long term debt, including interest payments1 $ 9,127.8 $ 1,672.0 $ 1,323.5 $ 519.5 $ 5,612.8 Capital lease obligations 60.8 8.0 12.5 11.5 28.8 Operating leases 514.9 111.7 155.1 100.3 147.8 Purchase obligations2 12,694.3 10,791.8 1,258.2 496.5 147.8 Other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 1,679.7 0.0 549.0 233.0 897.7 Other4 180.5 180.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total $ 24,258.0 $ 12,764.0 $ 3,298.3 $ 1,360.8 $ 6,834.9 1 Our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2011, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2011. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.09 billion, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year, none of which are individually material. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2011. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns. Consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance, when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. 26 We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g. patent expiries), an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. U.S. sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid), and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $2.46 billion, $1.66 billion, and $1.20 billion in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2011 would lead to an approximate $123 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2011, our sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was $1.23 billion. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 82 percent and 83 percent of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following represents a roll forward of our most significant U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2011 2010 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 1,155.3 $ 963.6 Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates1 4,016.9 2,876.1 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (3,574.3 ) (2,684.4 ) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 1,597.9 $ 1,155.3 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self insured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan 27 assets, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 81 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. If the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2011 annual expense would increase by $15.1 million. A one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2011 service cost and interest cost by $12.3 million. If the 2011 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $28.4 million. If the 2011 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $19.2 million. If our assumption regarding the 2011 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $35.3 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 82 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 81 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2011. Impairment of Indefinite Lived and Long Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the assets net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. There are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the income method, which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization, to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project independently. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the Late Stage Pipeline section. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some IPR&D assets will become impaired at some time in the future. The estimated future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require managements judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable 28 income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $40.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2012 For the full year of 2012, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $21.8 billion and $22.8 billion. This includes an expected decline of more than $3 billion in Zyprexa sales due to patent expirations in most markets outside of Japan. The reduction in revenue due to Zyprexa patent expirations is expected to be partially offset by growth in key franchises including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog, Humulin, and Forteo, as well as continued growth of newer products such as Effient, Axiron, and Tradjenta. We also anticipate continued strong, double digit revenue growth from our Elanco Animal Health business. Both Japan and emerging markets are expected to post continued strong underlying volume growth; however, overall revenue growth in these markets in 2012 will be adversely affected by anticipated pricing actions in Japan and by the expected impact of patent expirations, including Zyprexa, in some emerging market countries. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 77 percent. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to decline and be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. Research and development expense is expected to be flat to increasing and in the range of $5.0 billion to $5.3 billion. Other net, expense is expected to be in a range between net expense of $50 million and net income of $100 million. Operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and our current dividend. PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 A CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by us, including those above, are based on managements belief at the time they are made. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the implementation of U.S. health care reform; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired IPR&D charges; foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, patent disputes, and government investigations; the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals; and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects, which are discussed earlier in this section and in Item 1A, Risk Factors. We undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for any of these matters; however, we believe that, except as specifically noted below with respect to the Alimta Hatch Waxman Act patent challenges, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following U.S. patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): Alimta: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva); APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP); and Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patents and data based pediatric exclusivity period (compound patent licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2017, concomitant nutritional supplement use patent expiring in 2022) and alleging the patents are invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva, APP, and Barr seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. In July 2011, the district court entered judgment in our favor, upholding that patents validity. The generic manufacturers have appealed this decision. In October 2010, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Teva, APP, Pliva Hrvatska D.O.O., and Barr seeking rulings that our concomitant nutritional supplement use patent is valid and infringed. No trial date has yet been set. In January 2012, we filed a similar lawsuit against Accord Healthcare Inc. We believe the Hatch Waxman challenges to Alimta are without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated 29 results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We expect a loss of exclusivity for Alimta would result in a rapid and severe decline in future revenues in the relevant market. Strattera: Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun Ltd.), and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva USA) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent and data based pediatric exclusivity period (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this patent is invalid. In 2007, we brought a lawsuit against Actavis, Apotex, Aurobindo, Mylan, Sandoz, Sun Ltd., and Teva USA in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2010, the court ruled that our patent was invalid; however, in July 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned that decision, upholding the patent. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied the generic manufacturers petition for rehearing en banc in October 2011, and the deadline for any further appeal has passed. Zydus Pharmaceuticals (Zydus) filed an action in the New Jersey district court in October 2010 seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the right to launch a generic atomoxetine product, based on the district court ruling. We believe that Zydus is subject to the injunction issued by the court of appeals in the Actavis case. Zyprexa Litigation We are a defendant in approximately 40 Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 120 plaintiffs. The lawsuits allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Approximately 25 of the lawsuits, covering about 30 plaintiffs, are part of a Multi District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) (MDL No. 1596). In October 2011, a jury trial in a California state court was decided in our favor. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all these lawsuits and claims. We were served with lawsuits filed by 13 states alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. We settled the Zyprexa related claims of all of these states, incurring pretax charges of $230.0 million in 2009 and $15.0 million in 2008. In 2005 and 2006, four lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors, excluding governmental entities, which made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit, brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. In September 2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of third party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers, and denied our motion for summary judgment. In September 2010, both decisions were reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs overpricing claim. The U.S. Supreme Court denied plaintiffs petition for certiorari. All remaining claims at issue in these cases have now been resolved. Byetta Litigation We have been named as a defendant in approximately 120 lawsuits involving approximately 480 plaintiffs, primarily seeking to recover damages for pancreatitis experienced by patients prescribed Byetta. We are aware of approximately 530 additional claimants who have not yet filed suit. Approximately 100 of these lawsuits are filed in California and coordinated in a Los Angeles Superior Court. Other Product Liability Litigation We have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol. These claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Product Liability Insurance Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past several years, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. 30 Item 7A.
