Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Business Description Legg Mason, Inc. (the "Parent"), a holding company, and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, "Legg Mason") are principally engaged in providing asset management, securities brokerage, investment banking and related financial services to individuals, institutions, corporations and municipalities. Terms such as "we," "us," "our" and "company" refer to Legg Mason. Legg Mason has operations principally in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada and also has offices in Spain, Switzerland and Singapore. The financial services industry in which Legg Mason operates is very competitive and highly regulated. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the amount of our assets under management, the volume of trading in securities, the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, the level of customer margin and credit account balances and the demand for investment banking services. In addition, overall market conditions, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in retaining and attracting clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. Legg Mason currently operates through four business segments: Asset Management, Private Client, Capital Markets and Other. The business segments are based upon factors such as the services provided and distribution channels utilized. Certain services that we offer are provided to clients through more than one of our business segments. As such, the same revenue category may be reflected in multiple segments. We allocate certain common income and expense items among our business segments based upon various methodologies and factors. The Asset Management segment provides investment advisory services to company sponsored investment funds and asset management services to institutional and individual clients. Investment advisory and related fees earned by Asset Management vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management and the type of services that are provided. In addition, performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. The Private Client segment distributes a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. At March 31, 2002, Private Clients financial advisors operated out of 134 retail branch offices. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client are commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned on mutual funds, fees earned on fee based brokerage and managed accounts and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment are reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. The Capital Markets segment consists of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance advisory and underwriting activities. Fixed income institutional sales and trading include transactions in both taxable and municipal products. Although we maintain securities in inventory primarily to facilitate customer transactions, Capital Markets also realizes profits and losses from trading activities. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings are reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also include realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant banking and investment banking activities. The Other segment consists principally of our real estate service business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. All references to fiscal 2002, 2001 or 2000 refer to our March 31 fiscal year then ended. 27 Business Environment For the U.S. economy, fiscal 2002 was a period of slower economic growth, declines in corporate earnings and rising unemployment levels. During fiscal 2002, the equity markets continued to be volatile and weak, particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors. Corporate failures and the associated accounting questions have also contributed to the negative market conditions and low investor confidence. Finally, the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the political unrest abroad have also contributed to the sluggish economy. In an effort to stimulate the lagging economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve significantly lowered the overnight interest rate 11 times or 6.5% over the last 15 months. Although we were not physically impacted by the events of September 11, its effect on the economy and investor confidence negatively impacted our business and, in particular, our Private Client business. Despite the difficult market conditions, we were able to achieve record net revenues primarily as a result of the addition of fees from acquired entities and growth in fixed income investment advisory accounts. Results of Operations Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Many of our activities have fixed operating costs that do not decline with reduced levels of business activity. Accordingly, sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as percentages of net revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Net Revenues Period to Period Change Years ended March 31, 2002 2001 Compared Compared 2002 2001 2000 to 2001 to 2000 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees ........... 53.9% 48.1% 44.5% 19.5% 16.1% Commissions .................................... 22.8 26.3 28.7 (7.7) (1.2) Principal transactions ......................... 9.6 9.2 10.0 11.5 (1.4) Investment banking ............................. 7.0 4.8 5.5 55.1 (4.4) Interest ....................................... 11.6 20.7 17.6 (40.4) 26.5 Other .......................................... 3.9 3.8 4.3 11.6 (7.2) Total revenues. .............................. 108.8 112.9 110.6 2.8 9.8 Interest expense ............................... 8.8 12.9 10.6 (27.4) 30.5 Net revenues ................................. 100.0 100.0 100.0 6.6 7.6 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits ...................... 60.9 59.1 59.2 9.8 7.4 Communications and technology .................. 6.8 7.6 7.0 (3.7) 16.3 Occupancy ...................................... 4.3 3.8 3.8 20.4 7.3 Amortization of intangible assets .............. 1.3 0.9 0.9 51.8 13.1 Other .......................................... 9.3 9.1 9.0 9.1 8.2 Total non interest expenses .................. 82.6 80.5 79.9 9.4 8.3 Earnings Before Income Tax Provision .............. 17.4 19.5 20.1 (4.7) 4.5 Income tax provision ........................... 6.9 8.0 8.2 (8.5) 5.3 Net Earnings ...................................... 10.5% 11.5% 11.9% (2.1) 3.9 28 Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal 2001 Financial Overview In fiscal 2002, net revenues reached record levels and increased 7% to $1.45 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in investment advisory and related fees. On August 1, 2001, we acquired Private Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliated entities ("PCM"), a high net worth investment manager in Naples, Florida. At acquisition date, PCM managed $8.6 billion of assets, primarily in small to mid cap stocks. On October 1, 2001, we acquired Royce & Associates, Inc. ("Royce"), an investment manager located in New York City. At acquisition date, Royce managed $4.7 billion of assets, primarily in small and micro cap mutual funds. Both acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions. Under purchase accounting, the net assets and results of operations of both PCM and Royce are included in our financial statements from the respective dates of their acquisition. Revenues from investment advisory and related activities (including distribution fees from mutual funds) rose $127.6 million or 20% to $781.6 million in fiscal 2002, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce, which contributed $97.1 million of the increase. The remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to growth in assets under management in fixed income advisory accounts. Revenues from securities brokerage activities, including both commissions and principal transactions, declined 3% to $469.8 million as a result of a decrease in retail securities transactions and non affiliated mutual fund and variable annuity sales. These declines were offset in part by increases in fixed income and equity institutional securities transaction volume. Revenues from investment banking activities increased 55% to $102.2 million primarily due to a $34.2 million increase in new issue sales concessions and increased municipal banking fees. Other revenues increased 12% to $57.0 million primarily as a result of realized and unrealized gains on firm investments and an increase in loan origination fees, partially offset by the sale of a merchant banking related investment in the prior fiscal year. Our net interest profit declined 62% to $40.8 million from $106.8 million in the prior fiscal year as a result of lower average interest rates earned on firm investments, lower customer margin account balances and an increase in acquisition related debt. Net interest profit accounted for 16% of consolidated pre tax profits, down significantly from 40% in the prior fiscal year. Despite the increase in net revenues during fiscal 2002, net earnings declined 2% to $152.9 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of increased expenses, including profitability based incentive compensation, the addition of expenses of acquired entities and litigation related costs. In fiscal 2002, basic earnings per share declined 4% to $2.35 from $2.45 in fiscal 2001. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2002 declined 3% to $2.24 from $2.30 in fiscal 2001. The results for fiscal 2002 also include the effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which resulted in an expense reduction of $7.8 million ($6.7 million net of tax). This expense reduction increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.10 in fiscal 2002. Investment Advisory Revenues and Assets Under Management Assets Under Management Investment Advisory and Related Fee (in billions,"B") Revenues (in millions, "M") 98 $ 71.0B $315.8M 99 $ 88.9B $414.7M 00 $111.8B $563.5M 01 $139.9B $654.0M 02 $177.0B $781.6M Revenues By Segment The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, net revenues and pre tax earnings by segment: Years ended March 31, (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net revenues: Asset Management .................... $ 557.9 $ 445.0 $ 376.7 Private Client ...................... 618.2 707.4 694.2 Capital Markets ..................... 242.2 174.3 157.1 Other ............................... 33.0 34.2 37.2 Total ................................. $1,451.3 $1,360.9 $1,265.2 Pre tax earnings: Asset Management .................... $ 159.2 $ 132.3 $ 129.5 Private Client ...................... 53.3 113.3 114.2 Capital Markets ..................... 39.3 15.5 5.0 Other ............................... 1.4 4.7 5.7 Total ................................. $ 253.2 $ 265.8 $ 254.4 Asset Management Net revenues in Asset Management increased 25% to $557.9 million primarily as a result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce. Asset Management represented 38% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002, an increase from 33% in fiscal 2001. Revenues from Asset Management tend to be more stable than those from Private Client and Capital Markets because they are less affected by changes in securities market conditions. Total assets under management were $177.0 billion as of March 31, 2002, an increase of $37.1 billion or 27% from March 31, 2001. As of March 31, 2002, approximately $67.2 billion or 38% of assets under management were in equity related products and $109.8 billion or 62% were in fixed income related products. In fiscal 2002, PCM and Royce contributed fees of $97.1 million and the internal growth of our core fixed income institutional manager increased revenues by $29.2 million. Performance fees, 29 which are included in investment advisory and related fees, increased to $20.6 million in fiscal 2002 from $6.0 million in fiscal 2001, principally due to fees earned by PCM and Royce, as well as additional fees earned by other subsidiaries. Private Client The difficult market conditions in fiscal 2002, as well as significantly lower interest rates and lower retail transaction volume, negatively impacted Private Client. Accordingly, net revenues decreased 13% to $618.2 million for fiscal 2002. Private Client represented 43% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002, a decrease from 52% in the prior fiscal year. Net interest profit in Private Client decreased 35% to $57.1 million in fiscal 2002 because of significantly lower average interest rates and lower average customer margin account balances, offset in part by an increase in average firm investment balances, principally funds segregated for regulatory purposes. Commissions from retail securities transactions, including listed and over the counter trading, decreased approximately $38.6 million or 26% during fiscal 2002 from the prior year. Net revenues also declined from decreases in retail generated principal transactions and sales of non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. Capital Markets Capital Markets achieved record net revenues in fiscal 2002. Net revenues increased 39% to $242.2 million in fiscal 2002, primarily as a result of higher institutional equity and fixed income transaction volume. Capital Markets represented 17% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002, an increase from 13% in fiscal 2001. Other Other consists principally of the results of our real estate service business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. Net revenues were down slightly for the fiscal year from $34.2 million to $33.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower interest rates. Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest paid to customers on their credit account balances and interest incurred in connection with our long and short term borrowings. Interest expense declined $48.1 million or 27% in fiscal 2002, principally due to the sharp decrease in average interest rates paid on customer credit account balances and stock borrow balances. Offsetting these declines, we incurred $30.2 million of interest expense on long term debt issued in fiscal 2002 to fund the acquisitions of PCM and Royce. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding Legg Masons long term debt. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased 10% to $883.4 million, primarily attributable to significantly higher profitability based incentive compensation which increased by $36.9 million, the addition of $28.2 million in expenses as a result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce and an increase in vested deferred compensation of $10.8 million during fiscal 2002. These increases were offset in part by a decline in variable sales commissions of $10.6 million. A substantial part of compensation expense fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity. Other compensation costs, primarily salaries and benefits, are fixed and typically do not decline with reduced levels of business activity. Communications and Technology Communications and technology expense declined 4% to $99.0 million as a result of decreased costs for telephone usage, quote services and printing, offset in part by the addition of expenses of acquired entities. Occupancy Occupancy costs increased 20% to $62.2 million in fiscal 2002 from $51.7 million in fiscal 2001 as a result of a full year impact of prior year expansion, including an operations center and new branch offices, as well as the addition of expenses of acquired entities. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $6.4 million or 52% to $18.8 million from the prior fiscal year, primarily attributable to $11.0 million of amortization of PCMs asset management contracts, offset in part by the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142, under which goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Expenses Other expenses increased 9% to $134.7 million, primarily attributable to an increase in litigation related costs of $12.7 million (net of recoveries of $11.1 million). Fiscal 2002 net litigation related costs were $15.1 million compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2001. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision decreased 9% to $100.3 million in fiscal 2002 due to lower pre tax earnings and lower state income taxes. Legg Masons effective income tax rate was 39.6% in fiscal 2002, down from 41.2% in fiscal 2001 due to lower state income taxes and the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142, which eliminated non deductible amortization of goodwill for book purposes. 30 Fiscal 2001 Compared with Fiscal 2000 Financial Overview In fiscal 2001, revenues, net earnings and earnings per share were higher than fiscal 2000 as we achieved record levels. Net revenues increased 8% to $1.4 billion and total revenues were $1.5 billion, an increase of 10% from revenues of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2000. Investment advisory and related fees increased 16% to $654 million, primarily as a result of growth in assets under management in fixed income advisory accounts, fee based brokerage accounts and company sponsored mutual funds as well as the results of acquired subsidiaries. Net interest profit increased 21% to $106.8 million in fiscal 2001 from $88.6 million in fiscal 2000 due to increased interest income on higher margin account balances and average firm investments as well as higher average interest rates. Net earnings were $156.2 million, up 4% from net earnings in the prior fiscal year. Basic earnings per share increased 1% to $2.45 from $2.43. Diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $2.30 from $2.27. Revenues By Segment Asset Management Net revenues in Asset Management rose 18% to $445.0 million in fiscal 2001, primarily as a result of growth in assets under management in fixed income investment advisory accounts and company sponsored mutual funds and a full year of fees earned by Legg Mason Investors Holdings plc ("Legg Mason Investors"), which was acquired in December 1999. Total assets under management as of March 31, 2001 were $139.9 billion, up 25% from $111.8 billion as of March 31, 2000. Of the total assets under management as of March 31, 2001, approximately 33% were in equity related products and approximately 67% were in fixed income related products. Private Client Net revenues in Private Client were up 2% from $694.2 million in fiscal 2000 to $707.4 million in fiscal 2001, primarily as a result of a 14% increase in net interest income to $88.4 million driven by higher average interest rates and higher levels of customer margin account balances and firm investments, predominately funds segregated for regulatory purposes. Sales of non proprietary mutual funds also increased. Offsetting these increases were lower volumes of retail over the counter, listed and fixed income transactions. Capital Markets In fiscal 2001, net revenues in Capital Markets increased 11% to $174.3 million as a result of an increase in institutional equity securities transaction volume and sales and trading profits on taxable fixed income products. These increases were offset in part by a decline in investment banking fees, primarily from equity and municipal underwritings. Other In fiscal 2001, net revenues declined 8% to $34.2 million as a result of a decline in loan origination fees at the Parents real estate services subsidiary. Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense increased 31% to $175.4 million, primarily due to higher interest bearing customer credit account balances and higher average interest rates. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% to $804.8 million as a result of higher fixed compensation costs, primarily attributable to an increase in the number of employees and higher incentive and sales compensation related to asset management activities. Communications and Technology Communications and technology expense increased 16% to $102.8 million due to new and expanded branch office locations, increased investments in technology and increased quote and telephone usage due to an increase in the number of employees. Occupancy Occupancy costs increased 7% to $51.7 million as a result of additional costs for new and expanded branch office locations and the impact of acquired companies. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.4 million or 13% due to business acquisitions. Other Expenses Other expenses increased 8% to $123.4 million. This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of a full year of expenses of Legg Mason Investors, increased promotional expenses and costs associated with the acquisition of Perigee Investment Counsel Inc. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in floor brokerage and clearing fees. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision rose 5% to $109.6 million in fiscal 2001 as a result of increased pre tax earnings and an increase in Legg Masons effective tax rate to 41.2% in fiscal 2001 from 40.9% in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to non deductible foreign losses and higher statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. 31 Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support Legg Masons business strategies, as well as the regulatory capital requirements of our subsidiaries, and to provide needed liquidity at all times. Liquidity and the access to liquidity are essential to the success of our on going operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying our businesses. These opportunities may involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, the raising of additional capital and or the issuance of additional debt. We emphasize diversification of funding sources and seek to manage exposure to refinancing risk. Legg Mason has committed short term financing on both a secured and unsecured basis. Secured financing is obtained through the use of securities lending agreements and secured bank loans, which are primarily collateralized by short term U.S. government and agency securities, highly rated corporate debt, money market funds and equity securities. Short term funding is generally obtained at rates based upon benchmarks such as federal funds, LIBOR or money market rates. We maintain a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility of $100 million that matures on June 30, 2003 for general corporate purposes. The facility has restrictive covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain specified levels of net worth and debt to equity ratios. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of March 31, 2002 and 2001. Our real estate service subsidiary has two committed short term financing facilities that mature on September 15, 2002 and are used in connection with its business operations. The first is a $50 million warehouse line of credit from a national bank ($3.6 million and $4.9 million outstanding at March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively) that is used to provide interim financing for the funding of commercial mortgage loans. The Parent is a guarantor on this credit facility. The weighted average interest rates for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were 3.80% and 5.58%, respectively. The second credit facility is a financing agreement with the same national bank that allows for borrowing funds for short term investing of up to $125 million at an interest rate of 0.80% based upon the amount of customer escrow funds that are on deposit with the same bank. The credit facility is collateralized by the securities that are purchased with the funds, which are primarily short term U.S. government and agency securities, highly rated corporate commercial paper and money market funds. There were no outstanding balances on this line as of March 31, 2002 and 2001. We have maintained compliance with all applicable covenants of these facilities throughout the year. In the event that we fail to meet the covenants specified by these credit facilities, these lines of credit may not be available to us. Legg Mason also maintains uncommitted credit facilities from several banks and financial institutions. Uncommitted facilities consist of lines of credit that we have been advised are available, but for which no contractual lending obligation exists. As such, these uncommitted facilities would likely be unavailable to us if any material adverse effect on our financial condition occurred. We have not relied on the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund our operating needs nor do we utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities to provide operating liquidity. Legg Masons assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, collateralized short term receivables, investment advisory fee receivables, securities owned and borrowed, intangible assets and goodwill. Our assets are principally funded by payables to customers, securities loaned, bank loans, long term debt and equity. The collateralized short term receivables consist primarily of customer margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, all of which are secured by U.S. government and agency securities and corporate debt and equity securities. The investment advisory fee receivables, although not collateralized, are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is currently invested primarily in institutional money market funds. The highly liquid nature of our assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. Legg Masons total assets increased $1.2 billion from $4.7 billion at March 31, 2001 to $5.9 billion at March 31, 2002. This increase was principally due to a net increase in intangible assets and goodwill of $446.6 million and $341.3 million, respectively, primarily the result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce. The increase in intangible assets and goodwill was accompanied by a corresponding increase in long term debt of $679.7 million, which was the primary source of funds for the acquisitions of PCM and Royce. Stockholders equity surpassed the one billion dollar mark for the first time in Legg Masons history. As of March 31, 2002, stockholders equity was $1.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $87.8 million, which primarily reflects the use of cash in connection with the acquisitions of PCM and Royce. For fiscal 2002, cash flows from operating activities provided approximately $86.3 million, primarily attributable to net earnings, adjusted for non cash charges. Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations increased $486.3 million reflecting an increase in customer credit account balances and a decrease in customer margin account balances. 32 As of March 31, 2002, Legg Mason had three long term fixed rate debt facilities. We had $100 million outstanding of senior notes due February 15, 2006, which bear interest at a stated rate of 6.5%. The notes were originally issued in February 1996 at a discount to yield 6.57%. During fiscal 2002, we issued long term fixed rate debt to fund acquisitions. On June 6, 2001, we issued $567 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due on June 6, 2031, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $244 million. The convertible notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers at an initial offering price of $440.70 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. The discounted price reflects a yield to maturity of 2.75% per year. Upon certain events, including the sale price of our stock reaching certain thresholds, the convertible notes being rated below specified credit ratings and the convertible notes being called for redemption, each note is convertible into 7.7062 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. We may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after June 6, 2006 at their accreted value. In addition, we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders, on June 6, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011 and every five years thereafter until 2026 or upon a change in control of Legg Mason. Such repurchases can be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both. Approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion. On July 2, 2001, we issued $425 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were sold at a discount to yield 6.80%. The net proceeds were approximately $421 million. On August 1, 2001, Legg Mason purchased PCM for cash of $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction includes two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.4 billion. As such, we may be required to make maximum payments in the amount of $400 million on August 1, 2004 and $300 million on August 1, 2006 if certain conditions are met. On October 1, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Royce for cash of $115 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction includes three contingent payments based on Royces revenue growth for the years ending on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $215 million. We may, therefore, be required to make a maximum payment in the amount of $100 million on October 1, 2004 as part of this acquisition if certain conditions are met. We have the option to pay as much as 50% of the remaining purchase price for Royce in common stock. We expect to fund these commitments through operations, available lines of credit or the capital markets. In addition to PCM and Royce, we acquired two smaller investment management firms for approximately $7.6 million in cash. As of March 31, 2002, we had $75 million remaining for the issuance of additional debt or convertible debt securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement. A shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable. We intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes including the expansion of our business. There are no assurances as to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they depend on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance. Certain finance subsidiaries of Legg Mason previously issued secured, fixed rate long term debt in connection with their investment operations. The long term debt of the finance subsidiaries is scheduled to mature in fiscal 2003. As described in Market Risk below, there are specific assets that were purchased with the proceeds of the debt that will mature or will be available for sale to meet this obligation. During fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized Legg Mason, at its discretion, to purchase up to 3 million shares of its own common stock. As of March 31, 2002, we repurchased 136,800 shares for $7.1 million. In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we paid cash dividends of $25.1 million and $23.6 million, respectively. The Parents broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. As of March 31, 2002, the broker dealer subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of $310.6 million, which exceeded minimum net capital requirements by $289.4 million. The amount of the broker dealers net assets that may be distributed is subject to restrictions under applicable net capital rules. The Parents trust subsidiary is subject to the requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which requires compliance with two overlapping sets of regulatory capital standards. We believe that the trust subsidiary has met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Contractual and Contingent Obligations Legg Mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our short and long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, we may also be required to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements if certain future events occur. See Notes 2, 7, 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure related to our commitments. 33 The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations: Short term borrowings by contract maturity ......... $ 3.6 $ $ $ $ $ $ 3.6 Long term borrowings by contract maturity (a) ...... 100.9 264.0 100.0 425.0 889.9 Coupon interest on long term borrowings ............ 35.2 35.2 35.2 35.2 31.9 43.0 215.7 Minimum rental commitments ......................... 61.8 47.5 34.9 26.0 21.1 47.3 238.6 Total Contractual Obligations ................... $ 201.5 $ 346.7 $ 70.1 $ 161.2 $ 53.0 $ 515.3 $ 1,347.8 Contingent Obligations: Contingent payments related to business acquisitions (b) ................................ 3.6 1.0 500.0 13.8 300.0 818.4 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations (c) ... $ 205.1 $ 347.7 $ 570.1 $ 175.0 $ 353.0 $ 515.3 $ 2,166.2 (a) The amount reflected for long term borrowings due in 2003 represents notes payable of finance subsidiaries. This obligation will be funded by proceeds from the related investments, which will mature or will be available for sale in 2003. Payments in 2004 reflect amounts that may be due to holders of the zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes, which represents the accreted value on the earliest possible date that the holders may require us to purchase the notes. Legg Mason may choose to pay the purchase price in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both. (b) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (c) The table above does not include approximately $10.3 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from 2005 to 2010. Risk Management Risk is an inherent part of our business and activities. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our soundness and profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities: funding, market, credit, operational and legal. Risk management at Legg Mason is a multi faceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Currently, we have four formal risk management committees: credit, capital markets commitments, new products and new business. Our risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Funding risk is discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Market Risk The potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments we own is referred to as market risk. Our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and the correlation among them, along with the level of volatility. Interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayments and credit spreads. Equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices. Legg Mason makes dealer markets in equity and debt securities. To facilitate customer order flow, we may be required to own equity and debt securities in our trading and inventory accounts. The majority of our trading and inventory accounts consist of fixed income debt instruments. We attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short position. For example, we may hedge a municipal portfolio by taking an offsetting position in a related futures contract. Due to imperfections in correlations, gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged. Position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis. Each day, consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management, which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups. We also monitor inventory aging, pricing, concentration and securities ratings. 34 The following table categorizes Legg Masons market risk sensitive financial instruments: Financial Instruments with Market Risk at March 31, 2002 Years to Maturity (in thousands) 1 or less 1 to 5 5 to 10 Over 10 Total Fair Value of Trading Securities: U.S. government and agencies ................................ $ $ (21,169) $ (984) $ 9,870 $ (12,283) Corporate debt .............................................. 7,076 7,254 1,172 4,657 20,159 State and municipal bonds ................................... 52,886 2,173 3,148 19,482 77,689 Total debt securities ..................................... 59,962 (11,742) 3,336 34,009 85,565 Equity and other securities ................................. 10,235 10,235 Total trading securities .................................. $ 59,962 $ (11,742) $ 3,336 $ 44,244 $ 95,800 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments: U.S. government and agencies ................................ $ 123,114 $ 996 $ 206 $ 2,765 $ 127,081 Corporate debt .............................................. 6,657 6,657 Total debt securities ..................................... 129,771 996 206 2,765 133,738 Equity and other securities ................................. 16,858 16,858 Total other financial instruments ......................... $ 129,771 $ 996 $ 206 $ 19,623 $ 150,596 Total trading and other financial instruments ............. $ 189,733 $ (10,746) $ 3,542 $ 63,867 $ 246,396 Weighted Average Yield: U.S. government and agencies ................................ 3.10% 4.67% 5.41% 5.40% Corporate debt .............................................. 2.26 5.47 6.07 6.47 State and municipal bonds ................................... 1.37 3.86 4.54 4.99 Financial Instruments with Market Risk at March 31, 2001 Years to Maturity (in thousands) 1 or less 1 to 5 5 to 10 Over 10 Total Fair Value of Trading Securities: U.S. government and agencies ................................ $ 3 $ (24,183) $ 77 $ 760 $ (23,343) Corporate debt .............................................. 1,514 10,939 7,184 15,158 34,795 State and municipal bonds ................................... 755 8,901 22,670 40,226 72,552 Total debt securities ..................................... 2,272 (4,343) 29,931 56,144 84,004 Equity and other securities ................................. 4,370 4,370 Total trading securities .................................. $ 2,272 $ (4,343) $ 29,931 $ 60,514 $ 88,374 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments: U.S. government and agencies ................................ $ 65,156 $ 256 $ 281 $ 4,101 $ 69,794 Corporate debt .............................................. 2,184 2,184 Total debt securities ..................................... 67,340 256 281 4,101 71,978 Equity and other securities ................................. 6,521 6,521 Total other financial instruments ......................... $ 67,340 $ 256 $ 281 $ 10,622 $ 78,499 Total trading and other financial instruments ............. $ 69,612 $ (4,087) $ 30,212 $ 71,136 $ 166,873 Weighted Average Yield: U.S. government and agencies ................................ 5.29% 5.27% 5.03% 6.03% Corporate debt .............................................. 5.43 6.86 6.39 7.76 State and municipal bonds ................................... 4.61 4.09 4.07 4.53 The tables include net long and short values, which is consistent with the way the firm manages risk exposure. See Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the related gross long and short fair values of financial instruments owned and investments. Fair value of other financial instruments includes U.S. treasury securities segregated for regulatory purposes of $122.9 million and $64.4 million at March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 35 The purpose of Legg Mason Investors finance subsidiaries (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) is to raise funds by issuing secured fixed rate loan securities and to use the proceeds to invest in a portfolio of bonds issued by various financial institutions which are not generally available to the public in tranches small enough for the retail investor. The Investments of finance subsidiaries and the Notes payable of finance subsidiaries on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are directly related, have offsetting risk characteristics and do not represent a material market risk to Legg Mason. Additionally, claims of the note holders are limited to the assets of the finance subsidiaries, which limits our exposure to default risk on the investments. The assets and liabilities of the finance subsidiaries mature or are available for sale during fiscal 2003. In addition to the financial instruments included in the table, we have three long term debt facilities, which are described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are impacted by fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are not material to our financial condition. For fiscal 2002, the impact of currency fluctuations on our results of operations was not material. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client, counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by Legg Mason fails to perform its contractual obligations to us. We follow industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral. Credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which are monitored daily. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform sensitivity analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. Operational Risk Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes. We operate different businesses in diverse markets and we are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, Legg Mason could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, we have procedures that require that all transactions are confirmed on a timely basis, that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances. September 11 heightened the need for comprehensive disaster recovery plans. Disaster recovery plans exist for our critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. We believe that our disaster recovery program, including off site back up technology and operational facilities, is adequate to handle a reasonable business disruption. However, there can be no assurances that a disaster directly affecting our headquarters or our operations center would not have a material adverse impact. Insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses. We also use periodic self assessments, internal audit reviews and independent consultants as a further check on operational risk and exposure. Legal Risk Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Legg Mason is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, collection activities, money laundering and record keeping. 36 Critical Accounting Policies Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of Legg Mason. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among Legg Masons current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations, Financial instruments owned, Investment securities, Investments of finance subsidiaries and Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the determination of fair value requires management to estimate the value of the securities based upon available information such as projected cash flows and a review of the financial and market conditions of the underlying company. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. In addition, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For instance, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them, and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value. We evaluate our non trading securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the value of the investment security recorded on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. As of March 31, 2002, we own approximately $4.6 million of financial instruments that are valued solely on our assumptions or estimates. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, it provides that the cost of an acquired entity must be allocated to the assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition. The excess cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired must be recognized as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset must be amortized over its useful life, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired, primarily asset management contracts and trade names, based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgement based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed. The value of contracts to manage assets in mutual funds and the value of trade names are classified as indefinite life intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage mutual funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. The assignment of indefinite lives to trade names is based on the assumption that they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. For significant acquisitions, including PCM and Royce, we engage the services of third party consultants to perform independent valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 37 As of March 31, 2002, we had $443.4 million in goodwill, $158.7 million in indefinite life intangible assets and $335.3 million in amortizable intangible assets. The estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets range from 5 to 20 years. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis. SFAS No. 142 requires intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill to be reviewed for impairment at least annually based on a fair value analysis. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on our financial statements and its current fair value must be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues and discounted cash flows, similar to the models we employ in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Substantially all of our goodwill is assigned to our asset management operating segment. We have defined our asset management reporting units to be wealth management, institutional and mutual funds, which are one level below the operating segment. During fiscal 2002, Legg Mason recognized an impairment charge of $1.2 million related to terminated asset management contracts acquired in a prior business combination. As of March 31, 2002, we have determined that our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets have not been impaired, based upon the methods described above. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM and Royce, involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the overall purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. These contingent payments are consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Generally contingent payments are recorded as additional goodwill. Reserves for Losses and Contingencies Legg Mason is the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities, including certain class actions which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages which could be substantial. Legg Mason has also been involved in governmental and self regulatory agency investigations and proceedings. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies," we have established reserves for potential losses that may result from such complaints, legal actions, investigations and proceedings. In establishing these reserves, we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses may be incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses. In making these decisions, we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations, consultation with legal counsel and our experience. If our judgments prove to be incorrect, our reserves may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions, which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies. Special Purpose Entities Special purpose entities ("SPEs") are trusts, partnerships, corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose. SPEs generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement, derive continued benefit, exhibit control or have recourse. We do not utilize SPEs as a form of financing or to provide liquidity, nor have we recognized any gains from the sale of assets to SPEs. Our primary relationship with SPEs involves one of our asset management subsidiaries, which is the collateral manager of a Collateralized Debt Obligation ("CDO") SPE. The CDO was established during fiscal 2002 as a vehicle for investors and issued approximately $383 million of debt and acquired a portfolio consisting primarily of high quality asset backed securities. We did not sell any assets to the CDO. For our services as collateral manager, we receive senior and subordinated management fees up to approximately $1.5 million annually. We may be removed as collateral manager under certain conditions. Currently, we do not own an equity interest in the entity, however, we have entered into a derivative contract whereby we may purchase $4.2 million of preference shares (approximately 1% of the entity) in four years. Other than this derivative, we have no financial commitments or guarantees to the CDO and the underlying debt is non recourse to us as collateral manager. As such, we do not consolidate this entity. The FASB has currently undertaken a project to address accounting for SPEs and we will continue to monitor the FASBs project to determine whether or not consolidation of the CDO will be required in the future. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS, but adjusts for the effect of potential common shares. Diluted EPS does not include 4.4 million shares that may be issued upon conversion of the zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due to the contingent nature of the conversion feature, which provides for conversion only in limited circumstances, including the sale price of our common stock reaching certain thresholds, the notes being rated below specified credit ratings and the notes being called for redemption. In the event that the notes become convertible into shares of common stock, or the shares are required to be included in EPS, diluted EPS will likely be negatively impacted. 38 Forward Looking Statements Information or statements provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason from time to time, including those within this Report, may contain certain "forward looking information," including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of client assets under management, anticipated expense levels, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. We caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and in "Item 1. Business Factors Affecting the Company and the Financial Services Industry." Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Legg Masons future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of assets under management; the volume of trading in securities; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; the ability of Legg Mason to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; the level of margin and customer account balances; competitive conditions in each of our business segments; the demand for investment banking services; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred by Legg Mason as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation; and the effects of acquisitions. Legg Masons business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. Effects of Inflation Based on todays modest inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, securities and receivables, we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation. The rate of inflation, however, can affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Recent Accounting Developments The FASB issued the following pronouncements that will be adopted by Legg Mason during fiscal 2003. SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" requires the fair value of a liability to be recorded for costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which the liability is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." This statement principally deals with implementation issues of SFAS No. 121, including developing a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002." SFAS No. 145 primarily provides guidance for reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt and sale leaseback transactions. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS Nos. 143, 144 and 145 to determine the potential impacts, if any, to Legg Masons consolidated financial statements. Item 7A.
