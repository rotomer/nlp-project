Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Business Description Legg Mason, Inc. (the Parent), a holding company, and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, Legg Mason) are principally engaged in providing asset management, securities brokerage, investment banking and related financial services to individuals, institutions, corporations and municipalities. Terms such as we, us, our and company refer to Legg Mason. Legg Mason has operations principally in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada and also has offices in Spain, Switzerland and Singapore. The financial services industry in which Legg Mason operates is very competitive and highly regulated. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, the volume of trading in securities, the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, the level of customer margin and credit account balances and the demand for investment banking services. In addition, overall market conditions, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in retaining and attracting clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. Legg Mason currently operates through four business segments: Asset Management, Private Client, Capital Markets, and Other. The business segments are based upon factors such as the services provided and distribution channels utilized. Certain services that we offer are provided to clients through more than one of our business segments. As such, the same revenue category may be reflected in multiple segments. We allocate certain common income and expense items among our business segments based upon various methodologies and factors. The Asset Management segment provides asset management services to institutional and individual clients and investment advisory services to company sponsored investment funds. Investment advisory and related fees earned by Asset Management vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management and the type of services that are provided. In addition, performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. The Private Client segment distributes a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. At March 31, 2003, Private Clients financial advisors operated out of 136 retail branch offices. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client are commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fees earned from fee based brokerage and managed accounts and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment are reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. The Capital Markets segment consists of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading, corporate and public finance advisory and underwriting activities, as well as corporate structured financing activities. Fixed income institutional sales and trading include transactions in both corporate and municipal products. Although we maintain securities in inventory primarily to facilitate customer transactions, Capital Markets also realizes trading profits and losses from trading activities. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings are reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also include realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities. The Other segment consists principally of our real estate service and mortgage banking business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. All references to fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001 refer to our March 31 fiscal year then ended. Business Environment The weak U.S. and global financial market conditions experienced in the prior fiscal year continued during fiscal 2003 as the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook remained. The equity markets were plagued by slow economic activity, corporate governance, regulatory and accounting issues, concerns over terrorism and the growing tension and ultimate war in the Middle East. Domestically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500 were down 23%, 28% and 26%, respectively, during the year ended March 31, 2003. The fixed income markets benefited during the year due to declining interest rates and the volatility of the equity markets. During fiscal 2003, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.50% to 1.25%, the lowest level since 1961. 30 The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act), as well as regulations established by the various market exchanges, were in response to the corporate governance and accounting scandals. The Act provides additional oversight to protect investors interests and addresses many issues including the independence of public accountants and boards of directors, and managements responsibility for fair and accurate disclosures. In addition, regulatory proceedings and investigations of the relationships between research analysts and investment banking operations at financial services companies have created uncertainty as to whether companies in the industry will be required to make significant changes in their research or investment banking operations. This difficult regulatory environment, coupled with the uncertain economic outlook, provided for a challenging business environment. Despite the difficult market conditions, we were able to achieve strong results of operations, primarily as a result of the addition and subsequent growth of revenues from entities acquired during fiscal 2002, a robust fixed income environment and the benefit of a full year of cost savings and efficiency initiatives. Results of Operations Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Many of our activities have fixed operating costs that do not decline with reduced levels of business activity. Accordingly, sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Net RevenuesYears Ended March 31, Period to Period Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 Compared to 2002 2002 Comparedto 2001 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees 56.3 % 53.8 % 48.1 % 10.2 % 19.4 % Commissions 20.7 22.8 26.3 (4.3 ) (7.7 ) Principal transactions 10.4 9.6 9.2 13.9 11.5 Investment banking 7.1 7.0 4.8 6.7 55.1 Interest 7.1 11.6 20.7 (35.3 ) (40.4 ) Other 4.1 4.0 3.8 7.5 13.5 Total revenues 105.7 108.8 112.9 2.3 2.8 Interest expense 5.7 8.8 12.9 (31.5 ) (27.4 ) Net revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 5.3 6.6 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 58.7 60.9 59.1 1.6 9.8 Communications and technology 6.0 6.8 7.6 (7.0 ) (3.7 ) Occupancy 4.3 4.3 3.8 4.9 20.4 Amortization of intangible assets 1.6 1.3 0.9 32.5 51.8 Other 9.2 9.3 9.1 4.1 9.1 Total non interest expenses 79.8 82.6 80.5 1.8 9.4 Earnings Before Income Tax Provision 20.2 17.4 19.5 21.7 (4.7 ) Income tax provision 7.7 6.9 8.0 17.0 (8.5 ) Net Earnings 12.5 % 10.5 % 11.5 % 24.8 (2.1 ) 31 FISCAL 2003 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2002 Financial Overview Net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were up 5% to $1.53 billion, 25% to $190.9 million and 24% to $2.78, respectively. On August 1, 2001, we acquired Private Capital Management, L.P. (PCM), a high net worth investment manager in Naples, Florida. At acquisition, PCM managed $8.6 billion of assets, primarily in small to mid cap stocks. On October 1, 2001, we acquired Royce & Associates, Inc. (Royce), an investment manager located in New York City. At acquisition, Royce managed $4.7 billion of assets, primarily in small and micro cap mutual funds. As of March 31, 2003, PCM and Royce managed $11.5 billion and $8.2 billion of assets, respectively. The benefit of a full year of results and growth of Royce and PCM increased net revenues by approximately $80.0 million (net of interest expense). Additionally, net earnings increased as a result of lower compensation costs as a percentage of net revenues, decreases in litigation related costs and the benefit of a full year of cost savings initiatives implemented in the prior year. Net Revenues Investment advisory and related fees, including distribution fees from investment funds, increased 10% to $860.3 million, primarily as a result of additional investment advisory fees of $90.5 million from Royce and PCM and growth of $40.9 million from our fixed income institutional investment advisor. Excluding acquisitions, these increases were offset in part by declines in investment advisory and distribution fees from company sponsored equity investment funds of $42.7 million and lower fees at certain non U.S. based investment advisors of $10.2 million. Investment Advisory Revenues and Assets Under Management Assets Under Management (in billions, B) Investment Advisory and RelatedFee Revenues (in millions, M) 99 $ 88.9B $ 414.7M 00 $ 111.8B $ 563.5M 01 $ 139.9B $ 654.0M 02 $ 177.0B $ 780.6M 03 $ 192.2B $ 860.3M Securities brokerage revenues, including both commissions and principal transactions, increased 1 % to $474.9 million as a result of increases in the volume of both institutional and retail fixed income transactions, sales of annuities and the impact of a full year of commissions earned by PCMs brokerage operations. These increases were offset in part by declines in listed retail equity transaction volume and sales of non proprietary mutual funds. Investment banking revenues increased 7% to $109.0 million, primarily due to increases in new issue and underwriting revenues, and increased merger and advisory fees. Other revenues increased 8% to $62.3 million, primarily as a result of a $3.1 million increase in annual retirement account fees due to more accounts being charged a fee and increases in the fee rates, higher loan origination fees at our mortgage banking subsidiary and a $1.3 million realized gain on the sale of certain contracts in our bank brokerage network, offset in part by unrealized losses on firm investments. Net interest profit declined 47% to $21.6 million primarily as a result of a decrease of $53.1 million in interest revenue due to lower average interest rates earned on customer account and firm investment balances, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $42.8 million as a result of lower average interest rates paid on customer credit account balances. In addition, interest expense increased $9.2 million as a result of acquisition related debt. Net interest profit accounted for 7.0% of consolidated pre tax profits, down significantly from 16.1% in the prior fiscal year. Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 2% to $897.5 million, primarily due to a full years impact of PCM and Royce, which resulted in an increase of $32.4 million in compensation related expenses, and higher profitability based asset management incentive expense, offset in part by a decline in sales and distribution fee commissions of $27.6 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 58.7% in fiscal 2003 from 60.9% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to our Private Client and Capital Market segments. A substantial part of compensation expense fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity. Other compensation costs, primarily salaries and benefits, are fixed and typically do not decline with reduced levels of business activity. Communications and technology expense declined 7% to $92.0 million, primarily as a result of declines in costs for quote services, consulting fees and leased computer equipment. Occupancy increased 5% to $65.2 million, primarily due to the impact of a full year of expenses of acquired entities, higher operating expenses at our corporate headquarters and the addition of office space leased by our fixed income institutional investment advisor. 32 Amortization of intangible assets increased 32% to $24.9 million, primarily as a result of a $5.5 million increase related to a full year of amortization of asset management contracts acquired in the PCM acquisition. We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective April 1, 2001, under which goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expenses increased 4% to $140.3 million, primarily as a result of the impact of a full year of commissions paid to third party distributors of Royce funds, the addition of expenses of acquired entities and an increase of $2.1 million in reserves for recruiting related advances to financial advisors. These increases were offset in part by a decline in litigation related expenses of approximately $5.7 million and lower promotional expenses. The provision for income taxes increased 17% to $117.4 million in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of the increase in pretax earnings. The effective tax rate declined to 38.1% from 39.6% in the prior year due to lower average effective state income tax rates resulting from changes in state apportionment factors, $2.6 million in one time net state income tax refunds and a lower average effective foreign tax rate as a result of realizing the tax benefits of U.K. net operating loss carryforwards. We do not expect that the changes in state apportionment factors will continue to further reduce effective state tax rates. Results by Segment Asset Management Years Ended March 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Net revenues $ 648.1 $ 557.9 Non interest expenses 469.4 398.7 Pre tax earnings $ 178.7 $ 159.2 Profit margin 27.6 % 28.5 % Net revenues in Asset Management increased 16% to $648.1 million and pre tax earnings increased 12% to $178.7 million, principally as a result of the impact of a full year of results and growth at PCM and Royce, as well as growth at our fixed income institutional investment advisor. Revenues from Asset Management tend to be more stable than those from Private Client and Capital Markets because they are less affected by changes in securities market conditions. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues increased to 48.3% in fiscal 2003 from 46.7% in fiscal 2002 and the pre tax profit margin decreased to 27.6% in fiscal 2003 from 28.5% in fiscal 2002 because a higher percentage of revenues were generated by subsidiaries that retain a larger percentage of revenues, under revenue sharing agreements, as incentive compensation. Asset Management represented 42.4% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003, an increase from 38.4% in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, PCM and Royce contributed an additional $90.5 million of investment advisory fees and $31.3 million of pre tax earnings. In addition, investment advisory fees grew $40.9 million at our fixed income institutional investment advisor. These increases were offset in part by declines of $19.2 million in advisory fees from company sponsored equity investment funds and $10.2 million in advisory fees from certain non U.S. based investment advisors. In addition, net interest profit decreased $11.9 million primarily as a result of lower average interest rates earned on firm investment balances and an increase in acquisition related debt. Included in the current fiscal year are charges of $2.8 million related to write downs of previously acquired asset management contracts. Total assets under management were $192.2 billion as of March 31, 2003, an increase of $15.2 billion or 9% from March 31, 2002. As of March 31, 2003, approximately $132.1 billion or 68.7% of assets under management were in fixed income related products and $60.1 billion or 31.3% were in equity related products. Our assets under management mix was as follows: Institutional $136.8 billion (71.2%); Mutual Funds $35.9 billion (18.7%); and Wealth Management $19.5 billion (10.1%). Private Client Years Ended March 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Net revenues $ 588.6 $ 618.2 Non interest expenses 511.0 564.9 Pre tax earnings $ 77.6 $ 53.3 Profit margin 13.2 % 8.6 % Despite a decline in Private Clients net revenues of 5% to $588.6 million, pre tax earnings increased 46% to $77.6 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 58.1% in fiscal 2003 from 61.9% in fiscal 2002 as a result of lower effective commission payout rates and incentive compensation. The pre tax profit margin increased to 13.2% in fiscal 2003 from 8.6% in fiscal 2002. Private Client represented 38.5% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003, a decrease from 42.6% in the prior year. Net revenues declined primarily due to a decrease of $19.8 million in distribution fee revenues on company sponsored investment funds, principally equity funds, and lower retail transaction volume. Improved pre tax earnings and profit margin are attributable to a decline in non interest expenses, driven by cost savings initiatives implemented last year, including the impact of branch consolidations, a reduction in the number of full time employees and lower costs for communication services. Net interest profit in Private Client decreased 12% to $49.9 million, primarily due to a decline in average interest rates earned on firm investment balances. 33 Capital Markets Years Ended March 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Net revenues $ 259.7 $ 242.2 Non interest expenses 207.2 202.9 Pre tax earnings $ 52.5 $ 39.3 Profit margin 20.2 % 16.2 % Net revenues in Capital Markets increased 7% to $259.7 million, while pre tax earnings increased 34% to $52.5 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 56.4% in fiscal 2003 from 60.6% in fiscal 2002 due to lower effective percentage payouts for incentive compensation on higher revenues. The pre tax profit margin increased to 20.2% in fiscal 2003 from 16.2% in fiscal 2002. Capital Markets represented 17.0% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003 and 16.7% in fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to higher institutional fixed income transaction volume and trading profits, as well as increases in municipal banking fees, offset in part by a decline in corporate banking fees and unrealized losses related to warrants acquired in connection with private placements. Other Years Ended March 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Net revenues $ 31.8 $ 33.0 Non interest expenses 32.3 31.6 Pre tax earnings $ (0.5) $ 1.4 Profit margin (1.6) % 4.2 % Other consists principally of the results of our real estate service and mortgage banking business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. Net revenues and pre tax earnings declined $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, from the prior year, reflecting a reduction in net interest profit at our real estate service and mortgage banking subsidiary, partially offset by increased mortgage banking fees. FISCAL 2002 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2001 Financial Overview In fiscal 2002, net revenues reached then record levels and increased 7% to $1.45 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in investment advisory and related fees. Despite the increase in net revenues during fiscal 2002, net earnings declined 2% to $152.9 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of increased expenses, including profitability based incentive compensation, the addition of expenses of acquired entities and litigation related costs. In fiscal 2002, diluted earnings per share declined 3% to $2.24 from $2.30 in fiscal 2001. The results for fiscal 2002 also include the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142, which resulted in an expense reduction of $7.8 million ($6.7 million net of tax). This expense reduction increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.10 in fiscal 2002. Net Revenues Revenues from investment advisory and related activities rose $126.6 million or 19% to $780.6 million in fiscal 2002, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce, which contributed $97.1 million to the increase. The remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to growth in assets under management in fixed income investment advisory accounts. Revenues from securities brokerage activities declined 3% to $469.8 million as a result of a decrease in retail securities transactions and non affiliated mutual fund and variable annuity sales. These declines were offset in part by increases in fixed income and equity institutional securities transaction volume. Revenues from investment banking activities increased 55% to $102.2 million primarily due to a $34.2 million increase in new issue sales concessions and increased municipal banking fees. Other revenues increased 14% to $58.0 million primarily as a result of realized and unrealized gains on firm investments and an increase in loan origination fees, partially offset by the sale of a merchant banking related investment in the prior fiscal year. Our net interest profit declined 62% to $40.8 million from $106.8 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a decrease of $92.0 million in interest revenue, due to lower average interest rates earned on customer margin account and firm investment balances, and an increase in interest expense of $30.2 million as a result of an increase in acquisition related debt. These decreases in net interest profit were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $69.3 million as a result of lower average interest rates paid on customer credit account balances. Net interest profit accounted for 16.1% of consolidated pre tax profits, down significantly from 40.2% in the prior fiscal year. Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits expense increased 10% to $883.4 million, primarily attributable to significantly higher profitability based incentive compensation, which increased by $36.9 million, the addition of $28.2 million in expenses as a result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce and an increase in vested deferred compensation of $10.8 million during fiscal 2002. These increases were offset in part by a decline in variable sales commissions of $10.6 million. Communications and technology expense declined 4% to $99.0 million as a result of decreased costs for telephone usage, quote services and printing, offset in part by the addition of expenses of acquired entities. 34 Occupancy costs increased 20% to $62.2 million in fiscal 2002 from $51.7 million in fiscal 2001 as a result of a full year impact of prior year expansion, including an operations center and new branch offices, as well as the addition of expenses of acquired entities. Amortization of intangible assets increased $6.4 million or 52% to $18.8 million from the prior fiscal year, primarily attributable to $11.0 million of amortization of PCMs asset management contracts, offset in part by the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142, under which goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expenses increased 9% to $134.7 million, primarily attributable to an increase in litigation related costs of $12.7 million (net of recoveries of $9.8 million). Fiscal 2002 net litigation related costs were $15.1 million compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2001. The income tax provision decreased 9% to $100.3 million in fiscal 2002 due to lower pre tax earnings and lower state income taxes. Legg Masons effective income tax rate was 39.6% in fiscal 2002, down from 41.2% in fiscal 2001 due to lower average effective state income tax rates and the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142, which eliminated non deductible amortization of goodwill for book purposes. Results by Segment Asset Management Years Ended March 31, 2002 2001 (In millions) Net revenues $ 557.9 $ 445.0 Non interest expenses 398.7 312.7 Pre tax earnings $ 159.2 $ 132.3 Profit margin 28.5 % 29.7 % Net revenues in Asset Management increased 25% to $557.9 million, and pre tax earnings increased 20% to $159.2 million, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of PCM and Royce. The pre tax profit margin decreased to 28.5% in fiscal 2002 from 29.7% in fiscal 2001. Asset Management represented 38.4% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002, an increase from 32.7% in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, PCM and Royce contributed fees of $97.1 million and the internal growth of our core fixed income institutional manager increased revenues by $29.2 million. Performance fees, which are included in investment advisory and related fees, increased to $20.6 million in fiscal 2002 from $6.0 million in fiscal 2001, principally due to fees earned by PCM and Royce, as well as additional fees earned by other subsidiaries. Interest expense in Asset Management increased to $44.6 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to an increase in acquisition related debt. The increase in non interest expenses is primarily attributable to the addition of expenses of acquired entities and an increase in profitability based incentives at our fixed income institutional investment advisor. Total assets under management were $177.0 billion as of March 31, 2002, an increase of $37.1 billion or 27% from March 31, 2001. As of March 31, 2002, approximately $67.2 billion or 38.0% of assets under management were in equity related products and $109.8 billion or 62.0% were in fixed income related products. Private Client Years Ended March 31, 2002 2001 (In millions) Net revenues $ 618.2 $ 707.4 Non interest expenses 564.9 594.1 Pre tax earnings $ 53.3 $ 113.3 Profit margin 8.6 % 16.0 % The difficult market conditions in fiscal 2002, as well as significantly lower interest rates and lower retail transaction volume, negatively impacted Private Client. Accordingly, net revenues decreased 13% to $618.2 million for fiscal 2002 and pre tax earnings declined 53% to $53.3 million. The pre tax profit margin declined to 8.6% in fiscal 2002 from 16.0% in fiscal 2001. Private Client represented 42.6% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002, a decrease from 52.0% in the prior fiscal year. Net interest profit in Private Client decreased 39% to $56.7 million in fiscal 2002 because of significantly lower average interest rates and lower average margin account balances, offset in part by an increase in average firm investment balances, principally funds segregated for regulatory purposes. Commissions from retail securities transactions, including listed and over the counter trading, decreased approximately $38.6 million or 26% during fiscal 2002 from the prior year. Net revenues also declined from decreases in retail generated principal transactions and sales of non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. Non interest expenses decreased 5% to $564.9 million, primarily as a result of lower variable sales commissions. Capital Markets Years Ended March 31, 2002 2001 (In millions) Net revenues $ 242.2 $ 174.3 Non interest expenses 202.9 158.8 Pre tax earnings $ 39.3 $ 15.5 Profit margin 16.2 % 8.9 % Capital Markets achieved then record net revenues in fiscal 2002. Net revenues increased 39% to $242.2 million in fiscal 2002, primarily as a result of higher institutional equity and fixed income transaction volume. Pre tax earnings increased 154% to $39.3 million and the pre tax profit margin increased 35 to 16.2% in fiscal 2002 from 8.9% in fiscal 2001. Capital Markets represented 16.7% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002, an increase from 12.8% in fiscal 2001. Non interest expenses increased 28% to $202.9 million, driven by increased compensation costs, including variable sales commissions and incentives. Other Years Ended March 31, 2002 2001 (In millions) Net revenues $ 33.0 $ 34.2 Non interest expenses 31.6 29.5 Pre tax earnings $ 1.4 $ 4.7 Profit margin 4.2 % 13.7 % Other consists principally of the results of our real estate service and mortgage banking business and unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. Net revenues were down slightly for the fiscal year from $34.2 million to $33.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower interest rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support Legg Masons business strategies, as well as the regulatory capital requirements of certain of our subsidiaries, and to provide needed liquidity at all times. Liquidity and the access to liquidity are essential to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, the raising of additional capital and or the issuance of additional debt. As part of our liquidity strategy, we emphasize diversification of funding sources and seek to manage exposure to refinancing risk. Legg Mason has available committed short term financing on both a secured and unsecured basis. Secured financing is obtained through the use of securities lending agreements and secured bank loans, which are primarily collateralized by short term U.S. government and agency securities, highly rated corporate debt, money market funds and equity securities. Short term funding is generally obtained at rates based upon benchmarks such as federal funds, prime rates, LIBOR or money market rates. We maintain a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility of $100 million that matures on June 30, 2003, for general corporate purposes. The facility has restrictive covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain specified levels of net worth and debt to equity ratios. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of March 31, 2003 and 2002. We are in the process of negotiating a new $100 million three year revolving credit facility with substantially the same terms as the current facility. We expect the new facility to be in place by June 30, 2003. Our real estate service and mortgage banking subsidiary has two committed short term financing facilities that mature on September 15, 2003 and are used in connection with its business operations. The first is a $50 million warehouse line of credit from a national bank ($24.8 million and $3.6 million outstanding at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively) that is used to provide interim financing for the funding of commercial mortgage loans. The Parent is a guarantor on this credit facility. The weighted average interest rates for fiscal 2003 and 2002 were 2.03% and 3.80%, respectively. The second credit facility is a financing agreement with the same national bank that allows for borrowing funds for short term investing of up to $125 million at an interest rate of 0.80% based upon the amount of available customer escrow funds that are on deposit with the same bank. The credit facility is collateralized by the securities that are purchased with the funds, which are primarily short term U.S. government and agency securities, highly rated corporate commercial paper and money market funds. There were no outstanding balances on this line as of March 31, 2003 and 2002. We have maintained compliance with all applicable covenants of these facilities throughout the year. In the event that we fail to meet the covenants specified by these credit facilities, these lines of credit may not be available to us. Legg Mason also maintains uncommitted credit facilities from numerous banks and financial institutions. Uncommitted facilities consist of lines of credit that we have been advised are available, but for which no contractual lending obligation exists. As such, these uncommitted facilities would likely be unavailable to us if any material adverse effect on our financial condition occurred. We have not relied on the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund our operating needs nor do we utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities to provide operating liquidity. Legg Masons assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, collateralized short term receivables, investment advisory fee receivables, securities owned and borrowed, intangible assets and goodwill. Our assets are principally funded by payables to customers, securities loaned, bank loans, long term debt and equity. The collateralized short term receivables consist primarily of margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, all of which are collateralized by U.S. government and agency securities and corporate debt and equity securities. The investment advisory fee receivables, although not collateralized, are short term in 36 nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds and securities purchased under agreements to resell. The highly liquid nature of our assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. Legg Masons total assets increased $127.8 million to $6.1 billion at March 31, 2003, principally as a result of a net increase in cash of $222.4 million, offset by the maturity of the investments of our finance subsidiaries of $97.3 million. The maturity of those investments was offset by a corresponding decrease in long term notes payable of the finance subsidiaries of $97.7 million. Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations increased $81.8 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in customer margin account balances of $62.2 million. Customer credit account balances remained relatively unchanged. Securities borrowed and securities loaned decreased $69.2 million and $59.7 million, respectively, reflecting a decline in demand for equity securities stemming from the weak equity market conditions. As of March 31, 2003, stockholders equity was $1.25 billion, a 15% increase over March 31, 2002. For fiscal 2003, cash flows from operating activities provided approximately $305.7 million, primarily attributable to net earnings, adjusted for non cash charges. We expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will be the primary source of working capital for the next year. As of March 31, 2003, Legg Mason had three long term fixed rate debt facilities with an outstanding balance of $786.7 million, an increase of $7.3 million over the prior year due to accretion of our zero coupon notes. We had outstanding $100.0 million principal amount of senior notes due February 15, 2006, which bear interest at a stated rate of 6.5%. The balance at March 31, 2003, was $99.9 million. The notes were originally issued in February 1996 at a discount to yield 6.57%. We also had outstanding $567.0 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due on June 6, 2031, that resulted in net proceeds of $244.4 million. The balance at March 31, 2003 was $262.7 million. The convertible notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers at an initial offering price of $440.70 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. The discounted price reflects a yield to maturity of 2.75% per year. Upon certain events, including the sale price of our stock reaching certain thresholds, the convertible notes being rated below specified credit ratings and the convertible notes being called for redemption, each note is convertible into 7.7062 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. We may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after June 6, 2006 at their accreted value. In addition, we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders, on June 6, 2005, 2007, 2011, and every five years thereafter until 2026 or upon a change in control of Legg Mason that occurs on or before June 6, 2006. Such repurchases can be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both. Approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion. We also had outstanding $425.0 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The balance at March 31, 2003 was $424.1 million. Proceeds from our long term debt were used to fund the acquisition of asset management entities. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2003 were BBB for Standard and Poors Rating Services and A3 for Moodys Investor Service, Inc. The Moodys Investor Service, Inc. rating increased in November 2002 from Baal. On August 1, 2001, Legg Mason purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction includes two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.4 billion. As such, we may be required to make maximum payments in the amount of $400.0 million on August 1, 2004 and $300.0 million on August 1, 2006, if certain conditions are met. Based upon the current level of assets under management and the associated revenue growth at PCM, we anticipate it is likely that a significant contingent payment will be made on August 1, 2004. On October 1, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Royce for cash of $115.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction includes three contingent payments based on Royces revenue growth for the years ending on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $215.0 million. We may, therefore, be required to make a maximum payment in the amount of $100.0 million on October 1, 2004 as part of this acquisition, if certain conditions are met. We have the option to pay as much as 50% of the remaining purchase price for Royce in common stock. Based upon the current level of assets under management and the associated revenue growth at Royce, we anticipate it is likely that a significant contingent payment in the form of cash, stock or a combination of both will be made on October 1, 2004. We expect to fund these commitments through cash available from operations, available lines of credit or by raising funds through the capital markets. As of March 31, 2003, we had $575.0 million available for the issuance of additional debt or equity securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement. A shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable. We intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of our business. There are no assurances as 37 to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they are dependent on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance. During fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized Legg Mason, at its discretion, to purchase up to 3 million shares of its own common stock. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we repurchased 884,900 shares for $42.0 million and 136,800 shares for $7.1 million, respectively. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, we paid cash dividends of $28.2 million and $25.1 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. The Parents broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. As of March 31, 2003, the broker dealer subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of $363.4 million, which exceeded minimum net capital requirements by $342.8 million. The amount of the broker dealers net assets that may be distributed is subject to restrictions under applicable net capital rules. The Parents trust subsidiary is subject to the requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which requires compliance with regulatory capital standards. As of March 31, 2003, the trust subsidiary met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments Legg Mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our short and long term debt, non cancelable lease agreements and a forward purchase agreement. In addition, as noted in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we may be required to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements if certain future events occur. See Notes 2, 7, 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations (In millions) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings by contract maturity $ 29.5 $ $ $ $ $ $ 29.5 Long term borrowings by contract maturity(a) 378.9 425.0 803.9 Coupon interest on long term borrowings 35.2 35.2 31.9 28.7 28.7 14.3 174.0 Minimum rental commitments 61.8 52.0 44.5 39.4 35.1 93.0 325.8 Forward purchase agreement(b) 4.2 4.2 Total Contractual Obligations $ 126.5 $ 87.2 $ 459.5 $ 68.1 $ 63.8 $ 532.3 $ 1,337.4 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(c) 1.0 500.0 6.8 300.0 807.8 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(d) $ 127.5 $ 587.2 $ 466.3 $ 368.1 $ 63.8 $ 532.3 $ 2,145.2 (a) Included in the payments in 2006 is $278.9, reflecting amounts that may be due to holders of the zero coupon convertible senior notes, which represents the accreted value on the next possible date that the holders may require us to purchase the notes. Legg Mason has the option to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock or a combination of both. (b) See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. (c) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (d) The table above does not include approximately $27.5 in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2004 to 2011. These capital commitments also include $1.3 of commitments to lend employees funds to invest in one of these partnerships. 38 Risk Management Risk is an inherent part of our business and activities. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our soundness and profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities: funding, market, credit, operational and legal. Risk management at Legg Mason is a multi faceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Formal risk management committees review extensions of credit, capital markets commitments, equity and fixed income market making activities and new product and business proposals. Our risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Funding risk is discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Market Risk The potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments we own is referred to as market risk. Our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and the correlation among them, along with the level of volatility. Interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayments and credit spreads. Equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices. Legg Mason makes dealer markets in equity and debt securities. To facilitate customer orders, we may be required to own equity and debt securities in our trading and inventory accounts. The majority of our trading and inventory accounts consist of debt instruments. We attempt to reduce our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short position. For example, we may hedge a municipal portfolio by taking an offsetting position in a related futures contract. Due to imperfections in correlations, gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged. Position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis. Each day, consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management, which enable management to monitor inventory levels and the results of the trading groups. We also monitor inventory aging, pricing, concentration and securities ratings. The following tables categorize Legg Masons market risk sensitive financial instruments by type of security and maturity date. The Fair Value of Trading Securities below reflects our Trading assets net of our Trading liabilities, which is consistent with the way we manage our risk exposure. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the related gross long and short fair values of our trading securities. The Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments includes Investment securities, in addition to treasury securities of $82.6 million and $122.9 million at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, included in Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations.

Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are impacted by fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations are recorded as a component of Stockholders equity and are not material to our financial condition. The impact of currency fluctuations on our results of operations was not material. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client, counter party or issuer of securities or other instruments held by Legg Mason fails to perform its contractual obligations to us. We follow industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral. Credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which are monitored daily. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform sensitivity analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. Operational Risk Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes. We operate different businesses in diverse markets and we are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, Legg Mason could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, we have procedures requiring that all securities transactions must be confirmed on a timely basis, that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counter parties in appropriate circumstances. We also use periodic self assessments, internal audit reviews and independent consultants as a further check on operational risk and exposure. 40 Disaster recovery plans exist for our critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. We believe that our disaster recovery program, including offsite back up technology and operational facilities, is adequate to handle a reasonable business disruption. However, there can be no assurances that a disaster directly affecting our headquarters or our operations centers would not have a material adverse impact. Insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses. Legal Risk Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Legg Mason is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have various procedures addressing issues, such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, protection of client information, collection activities, money laundering and record keeping. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of Legg Mason. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among Legg Masons current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations, Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Trading assets, Investment securities, Investments of finance subsidiaries and Trading liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the determination of fair value requires management to estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same security without restriction, but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. In addition, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. For instance, we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we were to sell them, and that any such sale would occur in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value. We evaluate our non trading securities for other than temporary impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. As of March 31, 2003, we owned approximately $5.3 million of financial instruments that were valued solely on our assumptions or estimates. Additionally, we had less than $0.1 million of unrealized losses on investment securities at March 31, 2003. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Effective April 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, it provides that the cost of an acquired entity must be allocated to the assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition. The excess cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired must be recognized as goodwill. SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset must be amortized over its useful life, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. 41 In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired, primarily asset management contracts and trade names, based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed. The value of contracts to manage assets in mutual funds and the value of trade names are classified as indefinite life intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage mutual funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. The assignment of indefinite lives to trade names is based on the assumption that they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. For significant acquisitions, such as PCM and Royce, we engage the services of third party consultants to perform independent valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of March 31, 2003, we had $454.5 million in goodwill, $159.2 million in indefinite life intangible assets and $311.2 million in amortizable intangible assets. Generally, the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets range from 5 to 20 years. We review our intangible assets and goodwill on a quarterly basis, considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue multiples, to determine whether the value of the assets is impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment, and is deemed to be impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues and discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Substantially all of our goodwill is assigned to the asset management operating segment. We have defined the asset management reporting units to be wealth management, institutional and mutual funds. During fiscal 2003, Legg Mason recorded an impairment charge of $2.8 million, of which $2.0 million represented the fair value of asset management contracts, acquired in a prior business combination, that were deemed to be impaired due to declining profit margins. The remainder of the impairment charge represented the fair value of asset management contracts, acquired in a prior business combination, that were terminated during the period. If actual results vary from the estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values assigned to assets, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge that could be material to our results. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM and Royce, involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the overall purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Generally, contingent payments are recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Reserves for Losses and Contingencies Legg Mason is the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities, including certain class actions, which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages, which could be substantial. Legg Mason has also been involved in governmental and self regulatory agency investigations and proceedings. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, we have established reserves for potential losses from such complaints, legal actions, investigations and proceedings. In establishing these reserves, we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses have been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses. In making these decisions, we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations, consultations with legal counsel and our experience. If our judgments prove to be incorrect, our reserves may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions, which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies. Special Purpose Entities Special purpose entities (SPEs) are trusts, partnerships, corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose. SPEs generally involve the transfer of assets 42 and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement, derive continued benefit, exhibit control or have recourse. We do not utilize SPEs as a form of financing or to provide liquidity, nor have we recognized any gains from the sale of assets to SPEs. Our primary relationship with SPEs involves one of our asset management subsidiaries, which is the collateral manager of four Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). The first CDO was established during fiscal 2002 as a vehicle for investors and issued approximately $383.0 million of debt and acquired a portfolio consisting primarily of high quality asset backed securities. We did not sell any assets to the CDO. For our services as collateral manager, we receive senior management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive subordinated management fees up to approximately $1.5 million annually. We may be removed as collateral manager under certain conditions. Currently, we do not own an equity interest in the entity; however, we have entered into a cash flow hedge whereby we may purchase a $4.2 million equity interest (approximately 1% of the assets of the entity) in three years. Since March 31, 2002, we became the collateral manager of three additional CDOs. These CDOs are vehicles for investors that issued, in total, approximately $1.1 billion of debt, the proceeds of which were used to acquire portfolios consisting primarily of high quality asset backed securities. Legg Mason did not sell any assets to these CDOs. For our services as collateral manager, we are entitled to receive senior management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive subordinated management fees up to approximately $2.2 million annually. We may be removed as collateral manager under certain conditions. Currently, we do not own an equity interest in any of the CDOs. Other than the cash flow hedge described above, we have no financial commitments or guarantees to the CDOs and the underlying debt is non recourse to us as collateral manager. These CDOs are not consolidated. As of March 31, 2003, we have recorded an unrealized loss of $1.5 million, net of tax, related to the cash flow hedge. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 provides guidance with respect to consolidation of SPEs that are deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). A VIE is an entity in which equity investors do not have characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from investors. We believe all of the CDOs described above are VIEs and, accordingly, the primary beneficiary, if any, would be required to consolidate the VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the entity that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns, or both. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of FIN 46 on these CDOs; however, we believe it is reasonably possible that we will have to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of some, if not all, of the CDOs described above as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. If we are required to consolidate all four of these CDOs, we estimate that we would record additional assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition of approximately $1.8 billion. If such liabilities are required to be recorded, we would disclose that such liabilities are without recourse to Legg Mason, as our role of collateral manager for such CDO pools does not expose us to risk of loss. In addition, in the normal course of our business activities, we become the general partner, and in some cases a limited partner, in investment partnerships and the investment manager and or managing member in limited liability companies. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of FIN 46 on these entities; however, we believe it is unlikely that we will have to consolidate these entities. See Recent Accounting Developments for additional details regarding the requirements of FIN 46. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended. We grant stock option awards with an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant, and accordingly, do not recognize compensation expense for stock option awards. Under the stock purchase plan, shares of common stock are purchased in the open market on behalf of participating employees and we provide a 10% contribution towards purchases, which is charged to stockholders equity. Restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock are recognized as expense over their vesting periods. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, we provide disclosure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the pro forma results under the fair value based method, as if compensation expense associated with stock option grants and the stock purchase plan had been recognized over the vesting period. The fair value of each option grant is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. If we accounted for stock option grants and the stock purchase plan under the fair value based method, net earnings would have been reduced by $22.6 million, $20.5 million and $15.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 43 On December 31, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 148 permits three alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method. In addition, the statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the applied method on reported results. We are currently in the process of determining whether to make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS, but adjusts for the effect of potential common shares. Diluted EPS does not include 4.4 million shares that may be issued upon conversion of the zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes, due to the contingent nature of the conversion feature, which provides for conversion only in limited circumstances, including the sale price of our common stock reaching certain thresholds, the notes being rated below specified credit ratings and the notes being called for redemption. If the notes had been converted as of April 1, 2002, diluted EPS for fiscal 2003 would have been negatively impacted by approximately $0.08 per share. Forward Looking Statements Information or statements provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason from time to time, including those within this Annual Report on Form 10 K, may contain certain forward looking information, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated change in our businesses or in the amount of client assets under management, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. We caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Legg Masons future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of assets under management; the volume of trading in securities; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; the ability of Legg Mason to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; the level of margin and customer account balances; competitive conditions in each of our business segments; the demand for investment banking services; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred by Legg Mason as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of net revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation; and the effects of acquisitions. Legg Masons business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. Effects of Inflation Based on todays low inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, securities and receivables, we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation. The rate of inflation, however, can affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges services provided by us. Recent Accounting Developments The following pronouncements have been issued by the FASB during the fiscal year. SFAS No.143. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, requires the fair value of a liability to be recorded for costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which the liability is incurred, if it can be reasonably estimated. 44 SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This statement principally addresses implementation issues of SFAS No. 121, including developing a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002, primarily provides guidance for reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt and sale leaseback transactions. SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 replaces the existing guidance provided by EITF Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 147, Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 72 and 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9. This statement provides guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of a financial institution, which had previously been addressed in SFAS No. 72, Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions, and requires those transactions to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. In addition, this statement amends SFAS No. 144 to include long term customer relationship intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, and would require these assets to be subject to an undiscounted cash flow recoverability impairment test that SFAS No. 144 requires for other long lived assets that are held and used. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for our March 31, 2003 financial statements and interim periods thereafter. FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 expands the disclosure requirements to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements regarding its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. For guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 also requires, under certain circumstances, the recognition, at the inception of a guarantee, of a liability for the fair value of the obligation as a result of issuing the guarantee. Guarantees of an entitys own future performance are not within the scope of FIN 45. As previously discussed in Special Purpose Entities under Critical Accounting Policies, FIN 46 requires the consolidation of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of VIEs by the primary beneficiary. FIN 46 also requires the disclosure of information concerning VIEs by entities that hold significant variable interests, but may not be the primary beneficiary. The provisions of FIN 46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and is effective for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for interests in VIEs that were acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 also requires the disclosure of the nature, purpose, size and activities of VIEs, as well as the maximum exposure to loss in connection with VIEs for any financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is reasonably possible that an entity will consolidate or disclose information about a VIE. SFAS Nos. 143 through 148 and FIN 45 and 46, became effective during the fiscal year and did not materially impact the consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2003. We are in the process of evaluating certain provisions of FIN 46, which are effective in subsequent periods. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. EITF 02 3 precludes mark to market accounting for energy trading contracts that are not derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133, as amended, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The provisions of this statement are effective for contracts entered into subsequent to November 22, 2002 and did not materially impact the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00 21 addresses the accounting for arrangements under which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The provisions of this statement are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not expect this statement to materially impact the consolidated financial statements. 45 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Risk Management for disclosure about market risk.
