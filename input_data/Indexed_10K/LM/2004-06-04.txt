ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Overview Legg Mason, Inc. (the Parent), a holding company, and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, Legg Mason) are principally engaged in providing asset management, securities brokerage, investment banking and related financial services to individuals, institutions, corporations and municipalities. We have operations principally in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada and also have offices in Spain, Switzerland and Singapore. Terms such as we, us, our and company refer to Legg Mason. Legg Mason currently operates through three business segments: Asset Management, Private Client and Capital Markets. The business segment classifications are based upon factors such as the services provided and distribution channels utilized. Certain services that Legg Mason offers are provided to clients through more than one of its business segments. Therefore, the revenue categories are allocated to multiple segments. Legg Mason allocates certain common income and expense items among its business segments based upon various methodologies and factors. These methodologies are by their nature subjective and are reviewed periodically by management. Business segment results in the future may reflect reallocations of revenues and expenses that result from changes in methodologies, but any reallocations will have no effect on Legg Masons consolidated results of operations. Asset Management provides investment advisory services to institutional and individual clients and to company sponsored investment funds. The primary sources of revenue in Asset Management are investment advisory, distribution and administrative fees, which typically are calculated as a percentage of the assets in the account and vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management and the type of services that are provided. In addition, performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in Asset Management when the fund is sold through direct marketing channels and in the Private Client segment when the fund is sold through its branch distribution network. Revenues from Asset Management tend to be more stable than those from Private Client and Capital Markets because they are less affected by changes in securities market conditions. Private Client distributes a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client are commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fees earned from fee based brokerage and managed accounts, and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment are reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. Capital Markets consists of Legg Masons equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance investment banking. The primary sources of revenue for equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading include commissions and principal credits on transactions in both corporate and municipal products. Legg Mason maintains proprietary fixed income and equity securities inventory primarily to facilitate customer transactions and realizes trading profits and losses from proprietary trading activities. Investment banking revenues include underwriting fees and advisory fees from private placements and mergers and acquisitions. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings are reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also include realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities. In September 2003, we sold the mortgage banking and servicing operations of Legg Mason Real Estate Services, Inc. (LMRES), which had been previously reported in a fourth segment: Other. Other also included certain unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. Consolidated results have been restated to reflect the historical results of the sold business as discontinued operations and the remaining operations of LMRES in Capital Markets. The corporate revenues and expenses that are not allocated to the business segments are now reported separately as Corporate. The most significant component of our cost structure is Compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes sales commissions that are based upon certain revenues and incentive bonuses that are based upon production levels and or profitability. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, equipment leasing and minimum contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and may not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, may not rise proportionately with increased business activity. 33 Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, the volume of trading in securities, the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, the level of customer margin and credit account balances and the demand for investment banking services, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. The financial services businesses in which we are engaged are extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous national, regional and local asset management firms and broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been affected by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers or acquisitions. The increasing competitive pressures require us to offer our customers many of the services provided by much larger firms. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws and by securities exchanges and other self regulatory authorities. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes in the post Enron era. In addition, the financial services industry has been the subject of a number of regulatory proceedings and requirements over the last two years, including changes in the relationships of research analysts and investment banking and proceedings regarding a number of mutual funds sales practices. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 has required us to implement new policies or review existing policies with respect to corporate governance, auditor independence and disclosure controls. In addition, various regulatory organizations adopted changes to their rules and policies in response to certain abuses and corporate scandals. All references to fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002 refer to our March 31 fiscal year then ended. Business Environment Fiscal 2004 began with continued economic uncertainty, fueled by the conflict in Iraq and continued focus on corporate governance, regulatory and accounting issues. Despite these factors, the equity markets improved substantially in fiscal 2004 as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500 were up 30%, 49% and 33%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. During fiscal 2004, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to 1.00%, the lowest level in 45 years. However, there was increased volatility in long term yields, as investor sentiment shifted between fears of deflation to fears of inflation. Recent economic growth has led to some speculation that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise short term interest rates during calendar 2004. As a result, equity and fixed income markets continue to be volatile and uncertain as we begin fiscal 2005, and we are unable to predict the impact this will have on our results. The financial services industry continues to be impacted by legislative and regulatory changes. Regulatory investigations into mutual fund trading practices within the financial services industry have uncovered instances of conflicts of interest and insufficient internal controls related to mutual funds and have resulted in a negative public perception of the mutual fund industry, numerous regulatory rule proposals, a strict regulatory environment and significant fines and penalties against, and fee reductions by, a number of financial services companies. Like numerous other firms, starting in September 2003, we received a subpoena from the office of the New York Attorney General (NY AG) and inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) relating to their investigations of sales practices, late trading, market timing and selective disclosure of portfolio holdings in connection with mutual funds. We have responded to the NY AG subpoena and the SEC inquiries and are cooperating with two separate SEC investigations. We are not currently able to determine whether any regulators will initiate enforcement actions as a result of their investigations, or to predict what effect, if any, the mutual fund investigations will have on our business, results of operations or assets under management. 34 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Net Revenues Period to Period Change Years EndedMarch 31, 2004Comparedto 2003 2003Comparedto 2002 2004 2003 2002 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees 62.7 % 57.3 % 54.8 % 41.5 % 10.2 % Commissions 17.7 21.1 23.2 8.5 (4.3 ) Principal transactions 8.5 10.5 9.8 4.6 13.9 Investment banking 7.7 7.3 7.2 37.7 6.7 Interest 4.3 7.1 11.5 (20.6 ) (35.0 ) Other 2.3 2.4 2.3 22.3 9.1 Total revenues 103.2 105.7 108.8 26.3 2.4 Interest expense 3.2 5.7 8.8 (26.6 ) (31.4 ) Net revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 29.4 5.4 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 56.0 58.7 60.8 23.6 1.6 Communications and technology 4.8 6.0 6.9 2.3 (7.3 ) Occupancy 3.4 4.2 4.2 6.1 5.0 Distribution and service fees 2.5 1.6 1.2 94.4 49.1 Amortization of intangible assets 1.1 1.5 1.2 (6.5 ) 33.5 Litigation award charge 0.9 n/m n/m Other 7.0 7.5 8.1 20.4 (2.5 ) Total non interest expenses 75.7 79.5 82.4 23.1 1.8 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision 24.3 20.5 17.6 53.9 22.2 Income tax provision 9.3 7.9 7.0 54.7 18.0 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations 15.0 12.6 10.6 53.4 24.9 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.1 0.1 n/m 16.4 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.3 n/m n/m Net Earnings 15.3 % 12.7 % 10.7 % 56.0 24.8 n/m not meaningful 35 FISCAL 2004 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2003 Financial Overview Legg Mason reported record net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2004. Net revenues increased 29% to $1.941 billion, primarily due to increased revenues from higher assets under management. Assets under management increased 49% to $286.4 billion as a result of approximately equal increases in net client cash flows and market appreciation. Net earnings increased 56% to $297.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $4.06, an increase of 46%. The pre tax profit margin increased to 24.3% from 20.5%. Included in fiscal 2004 is a single litigation award charge of $17.5 million. Our earnings were also affected by the impact of the sale of the mortgage servicing operations of LMRES, which increased net earnings by $6.5 million. Our diluted earnings per share included the impact of 4.4 million shares that would be issuable upon conversion of our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes, which became convertible in January 2004, when our stock price reached a convertibility threshold in the prior quarter, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.09. Net Revenues Investment advisory and related fees, including distribution fees from company sponsored mutual and offshore funds, increased 42% to $1.217 billion, primarily as a result of the combined growth from assets managed by Private Capital Management, L.P. (PCM), Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset), Royce & Associates, LLC (Royce) and Legg Mason Funds Management, Inc. (LMFM). Distribution fees from proprietary investment funds increased $53.0 million to $190.1 million. Investment advisory and related fees represented 63% of consolidated net revenues, up from 57% in the prior year. Investment Advisory Revenues and Assets Under Management Assets under management at March 31, 2004 were $286.4 billion, up 49% from March 31, 2003. Changes in the business environment during fiscal 2004, which gave rise to improvements in the equity markets, resulted in dramatic growth in our equity assets under management. Over $50 billion of the $94 billion increase in assets was in equity assets. Because we earn higher fees on our equity products, pre tax earnings rose 77% in our Asset Management segment. Assets under management as of March 31, 2004 and 2003 by type are as follows: 2004* % ofTotal 2003* % ofTotal %Change Equity $ 112.3 39.2 $ 60.1 31.3 86.9 % Fixed Income 174.1 60.8 132.1 68.7 31.8 % Total $ 286.4 100.0 $ 192.2 100.0 49.0 % * In billions 36 Assets Under Management by Division (In billions) Securities brokerage revenues, including both commissions and principal transactions, increased 7% to $509.0 million, primarily as a result of increases in retail client transaction volume, particularly listed and over the counter equities and non affiliated mutual funds. Commission revenues in fiscal 2004 were reduced by $7.4 million for reimbursements to clients for Legg Mason Wood Walkers failure to provide breakpoint discounts in connection with client purchases of non proprietary front end load mutual fund shares and $5.6 million as a result of the impact of the sale of our bank brokerage network in fiscal 2003. Investment banking revenues were $150.1 million, an increase of 38% over the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in retail and institutional selling concessions and corporate banking management fees from new issues. Other revenues increased 22% to $43.8 million, primarily as a result of net gains on firm investments. Net interest profit of $21.2 million increased 5% from $20.2 million in the prior year. Interest revenue declined 21% to $84.3 million as a result of significantly lower interest rates earned on higher average customer and firm investment balances. Interest expense declined 27% to $63.2 million as a result of significantly lower interest rates paid on customer credit account balances and lower amortized issue costs relating to our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes, which were fully amortized in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The net interest profit margin in the current period increased to 25.1% from 19.0% in the prior year, and accounted for 4.5% of earnings before income tax provision, down from 6.6% in the prior year. Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 24% to $1.087 billion, as a result of increases in profitability based incentive costs, primarily asset management related, and increased retail financial advisor sales compensation. However, compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 56.0% from 58.7% in the prior year, as a result of the impact of fixed compensation costs on increased revenues, a lower percentage of pre tax profits accrued for corporate executive incentive compensation and lower effective compensation rates. Communications and technology expense of $92.5 million was relatively unchanged from the prior year, as increased investments in technology were offset by the impact of lower depreciation as a result of assets that became fully depreciated in a prior year. Occupancy expense rose 6% to $66.5 million in the current year, primarily as a result of increased rent, equipment depreciation and relocation costs of $1.7 million related to Western Assets move to a new office location. We also incurred $1.0 million of additional costs to consolidate two investment advisory subsidiary office locations in New York City. Amortization of intangible assets declined 7% to $21.8 million, primarily as a result of asset management contracts that were fully amortized during the year. During fiscal 2004, we recorded a litigation award charge of $17.5 million as a result of a judgment in a copyright infringement lawsuit (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Distribution and service fees increased 94% to $47.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in distribution fees paid to third party distributors on sales of offshore and Royce funds. Other expenses increased 20% to $135.4 million in the current fiscal year, primarily due to: an increase of $8.0 million in audit and consulting fees as a result of a more stringent legislative and regulatory environment and legal fees for litigation; a $2.3 million fine levied by the SEC and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) as a result of our failure to provide certain clients the benefit of breakpoint discounts in connection with their purchases of non proprietary front end load mutual fund shares; stock based compensation expense of $2.1 million for stock option grants to our non employee directors; and an increase of $2.0 million in contributions to the Legg Mason charitable foundation. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses related to advances to financial advisors and impairment charges taken on intangible assets in fiscal 2003. The income tax provision increased 55% to $181.7 million, primarily as a result of the increase in pre tax earnings. The effective tax rate was 38.5% in the current fiscal year and 38.3% in the prior year. The current year reflects a lower average effective foreign tax rate, while the prior year benefited from $2.6 million in state income tax refunds. 37 Results by Segment Asset Management Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2004 2003 Net revenues $ 969.3 $ 648.1 Non interest expenses 653.0 469.4 Earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision $ 316.3 $ 178.7 Profit margin 32.6% 27.6% Net revenues in Asset Management increased 50% to $969.3 million and pre tax earnings increased 77% to $316.3 million, principally as a result of increased revenues from higher levels of assets under management. Investment advisory revenues at PCM, Western Asset, Royce and LMFM, combined, accounted for $224.5 million (or 73%) of the increase, including performance fees. Performance fees rose $20.0 million to $41.5 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues was 46.6% for fiscal 2004 and 48.5% in the prior fiscal year. The profit margin increased to 32.6% from 27.6% in the prior year as a result of a greater portion of revenues generated at subsidiaries that retain a lower percentage of revenues under revenue sharing agreements. Asset Management represented 49.9% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2004, an increase from 43.2% in the prior year. Net Revenues by Division within Asset Management (In millions) Private Client Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2004 2003 Net revenues $ 677.8 $ 588.6 Non interest expenses 557.1 511.0 Earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision $ 120.7 $ 77.6 Profit margin 17.8% 13.2% Private Client net revenues increased 15% to $677.8 million from $588.6 million in the prior year and pre tax earnings increased 56% to $120.7 million, principally as a result of increases in distribution fees on company sponsored mutual funds, corporate selling concessions and an increased volume of listed and over the counter securities transactions. Additionally, increased commissions on sales of non affiliated mutual funds and fees earned from fee based brokerage accounts contributed to the increase in net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of contracts in our bank brokerage network in the prior year of $9.9 million and the impact of a $7.4 million reduction in mutual fund commissions for breakpoint reimbursements to clients. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 57.4% in fiscal 2004 from 58.1% in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of lower commission rates paid on distribution fees from company sponsored mutual funds and the elimination of bank brokerage commissions, as a result of the sale of our bank brokerage network in the prior year. The profit margin rose to 17.8% from 13.2% in the prior year as a result of increased revenues and lower effective compensation costs. Private Client represented 34.9% of consolidated net revenues in the year ended March 31, 2004, a decrease from 39.2% in the prior year due to the significant increase in Asset Management net revenues. Net interest profit in Private Client declined 2% to $48.9 million. 38 Capital Markets Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2004 2003 Net revenues $ 295.8 $ 264.2 Non interest expenses 240.7 212.6 Earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision $ 55.1 $ 51.6 Profit margin 18.6% 19.5% Capital Markets net revenues increased 12% to $295.8 million from $264.2 million in the prior year as a result of higher corporate banking management fees and selling concessions on new issues, higher corporate advisory fees and increased institutional equity over the counter transaction volume. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues was 56.9%, compared to 56.8% in the prior year. The profit margin decreased to 18.6% from 19.5% in the prior year as a result of increased direct and allocated support costs. Capital Markets represented 15.2% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2004, a decrease from 17.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the significant increase in net revenues in our Asset Management segment. Corporate Years EndingMarch 31, (In millions) 2004 2003 Net revenues (losses) $ (1.8 ) $ (0.6 ) Non interest expenses 18.0 0.5 Earnings (losses) from continuing operations before income tax provision $ (19.8 ) $ (1.1 ) Profit margin n/m n/m n/m not meaningful Corporate includes unallocated revenues and expenses, primarily gains and losses on certain firm investments and the $17.5 million litigation award charge. FISCAL 2003 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2002 Financial Overview Net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were up 5% to $1.50 billion, 25% to $190.9 million and 24% to $2.78, respectively. On August 1, 2001, we acquired PCM, which at the acquisition date managed $8.6 billion of assets. On October 1, 2001, we acquired Royce, which at the acquisition date managed $4.7 billion of assets. As of March 31, 2003, PCM and Royce managed $11.5 billion and $8.2 billion of assets, respectively. The benefit of a full year of results and growth of Royce and PCM increased net revenues by approximately $80.0 million (net of interest expense). Additionally, net earnings increased as a result of lower compensation costs as a percentage of net revenues, decreases in litigation related costs and the benefit of a full year of cost savings initiatives implemented in the prior year. Net Revenues Investment advisory and related fees, including distribution fees from investment funds, increased 10% to $860.3 million, primarily as a result of additional investment advisory fees of $90.5 million from Royce and PCM and growth of $40.9 million from Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by declines in investment advisory and distribution fees from company sponsored equity investment funds of $42.7 million and lower fees at certain non U.S. based investment advisors of $10.2 million. Securities brokerage revenues increased 1% to $474.9 million as a result of increases in the volume of both institutional and retail fixed income transactions, sales of annuities and the impact of a full year of commissions earned by PCMs brokerage operations. These increases were offset in part by declines in listed retail equity transaction volume and sales of non proprietary mutual funds. Investment banking revenues increased 7% to $109.0 million, primarily due to increases in new issue and underwriting revenues, and increased merger and advisory fees. Other revenues increased 9% to $35.8 million, primarily as a result of a $3.1 million increase in annual retirement account fees due to more accounts being charged a fee and increases in the fee rates and a $1.3 million realized gain on the sale of certain contracts in our bank brokerage network, offset in part by unrealized losses on firm investments. Net interest profit declined 47% to $20.2 million primarily as a result of a decrease of $53.1 million in interest revenue due to lower average interest rates earned on customer account and firm investment balances, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $42.8 million as a result of lower average interest rates paid on customer credit account balances. In addition, interest expense increased $9.2 million as a result of acquisition related debt. Net interest profit accounted for 6.6% of consolidated pre tax profits, down significantly from 15.2% in the prior fiscal year. 39 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 2% to $880.1 million, primarily due to a full years impact of PCM and Royce, which resulted in an increase of $32.4 million in compensation related expenses, and higher profitability based asset management incentive expense, offset in part by a decline in sales and distribution fee commissions of $27.6 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 58.7% in fiscal 2003 from 60.8% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to our Private Client and Capital Market segments. Communications and technology expense declined 7% to $90.5 million, primarily as a result of declines in costs for quote services, consulting fees and leased computer equipment. Occupancy increased 5% to $62.7 million, primarily due to the impact of a full year of expenses of acquired entities, higher operating expenses at our corporate headquarters and the addition of office space leased by Western Asset. Amortization of intangible assets increased 34% to $23.3 million, primarily as a result of a $5.5 million increase related to a full year of amortization of asset management contracts acquired in the PCM acquisition. We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective April 1, 2001, under which goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Distribution and service fees increased 49% to $24.6 million, primarily as a result of the impact of a full year of commissions paid to third party distributors of Royce funds. Other expenses decreased 3% to $112.5 million, primarily as a result of a decline in litigation related expenses of approximately $5.7 million and lower promotional expenses. These decreases were offset in part by the addition of expenses of acquired entities and an increase of $2.1 million in allowances for recruiting related advances to financial advisors. The income tax provision increased 18% to $117.4 million in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of the increase in pre tax earnings. The effective tax rate declined to 38.3% from 39.6% in the prior year due to lower average effective state income tax rates resulting from changes in state apportionment factors, $2.6 million in one time net state income tax refunds and a lower average effective foreign tax rate as a result of realizing the tax benefits of U.K. net operating loss carryforwards. Results by Segment Asset Management Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2003 2002 Net revenues $ 648.1 $ 557.9 Non interest expenses 469.4 398.7 Earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision $ 178.7 $ 159.2 Profit margin 27.6% 28.5% Net revenues in Asset Management increased 16% to $648.1 million and pre tax earnings increased 12% to $178.7 million, principally as a result of the impact of a full year of results and growth at PCM and Royce, as well as growth at Western Asset. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues increased to 48.3% in fiscal 2003 from 46.7% in fiscal 2002 and the pre tax profit margin decreased to 27.6% in fiscal 2003 from 28.5% in fiscal 2002 because a higher percentage of revenues were generated by subsidiaries that retain a larger percentage of revenues, under revenue sharing agreements, as incentive compensation. Asset Management represented 43.2% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003, an increase from 39.2% in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, PCM and Royce contributed an additional $90.5 million of investment advisory fees and $31.3 million of pre tax earnings. In addition, investment advisory fees grew $40.9 million at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by declines of $19.2 million in advisory fees from company sponsored equity investment funds and $10.2 million in advisory fees from certain non U.S. based investment advisors. In addition, net interest profit decreased $11.9 million primarily as a result of lower average interest rates earned on firm investment balances and an increase in acquisition related debt. Included in the current fiscal year are charges of $2.8 million related to write downs of previously acquired asset management contracts. Net Revenues by Division within Asset Management (In millions) 40 Private Client Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2003 2002 Net revenues $ 588.6 $ 618.2 Non interest expenses 511.0 564.9 Earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision $ 77.6 $ 53.3 Profit margin 13.2% 8.6% Despite a decline in Private Clients net revenues of 5% to $588.6 million, pre tax earnings increased 46% to $77.6 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 58.1% in fiscal 2003 from 61.9% in fiscal 2002 as a result of lower effective commission payout rates and incentive compensation. The pre tax profit margin increased to 13.2% in fiscal 2003 from 8.6% in fiscal 2002. Private Client represented 39.2% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003, a decrease from 43.4% in the prior year. Net revenues declined primarily due to a decrease of $19.8 million in distribution fee revenues on company sponsored investment funds, principally equity funds, and lower retail transaction volume. Improved pre tax earnings and profit margin are attributable to a decline in non interest expenses, driven by cost savings initiatives implemented last year, including the impact of branch consolidations, a reduction in the number of full time employees and lower costs for communication services. Net interest profit in Private Client decreased 12% to $49.9 million, primarily due to a decline in average interest rates earned on firm investment balances. Capital Markets Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2003 2002 Net revenues $ 264.2 $ 247.6 Non interest expenses 212.6 208.6 Earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision $ 51.6 $ 39.0 Profit margin 19.5% 15.8% Net revenues in Capital Markets increased 7% to $264.2 million, while pre tax earnings increased 32% to $51.6 million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 56.8% in fiscal 2003 from 60.9% in fiscal 2002 due to lower effective percentage payouts for incentive compensation on higher revenues. The pre tax profit margin increased to 19.5% in fiscal 2003 from 15.8% in fiscal 2002. Capital Markets represented 17.6% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003 and 17.4% in fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to higher institutional fixed income transaction volume and trading profits, as well as increases in municipal banking fees, offset in part by a decline in corporate banking fees and unrealized losses related to warrants acquired in connection with private placements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support Legg Masons business strategies, as well as the regulatory capital requirements of certain of our subsidiaries, and to provide needed liquidity at all times. Liquidity and the access to liquidity are essential to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, the raising of additional capital and or the issuance of additional debt. As part of our liquidity strategy, we emphasize diversification of funding sources and seek to manage exposure to refinancing risk. Legg Mason has available committed short term financing on both a secured and unsecured basis. Secured financing is obtained through the use of securities lending agreements and secured bank loans, which are primarily collateralized by short term U.S. government and agency securities, highly rated corporate debt, money market funds and equity securities. Short term funding is generally obtained at rates based upon benchmarks such as federal funds, prime rates, LIBOR or money market rates. 41 We maintain a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility of $100 million that matures on June 30, 2006, for general corporate purposes that may include short term funding needs. The facility has restrictive covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain specified levels of net worth and debt to equity ratios. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of March 31, 2004 and 2003. Legg Mason also maintains uncommitted credit facilities from numerous banks and financial institutions. Uncommitted facilities consist of lines of credit that we have been advised are available, but for which no contractual lending obligation exists. As such, these uncommitted facilities would likely be unavailable to us if any material adverse effect on our financial condition occurred. We have not relied on the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund our operating needs nor do we utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities to provide operating liquidity. On September 30, 2003, we sold certain assets and liabilities comprising the commercial mortgage banking and mortgage servicing operations of our wholly owned subsidiary, LMRES. LMRES will continue to operate its real estate investment advisory group. The cash received at closing for the sale of the assets was approximately $63.5 million, which included $40.9 million that was used to repay the outstanding balance of a secured warehouse line of credit. The cash at closing excluded a $6.9 million non interest bearing note due four years from closing. In addition, the short term investments securing the outstanding borrowings under a committed, secured compensating balance line of credit were liquidated and the line of credit, used by the mortgage banking and servicing operations, was repaid. Both of these lines of credit are no longer part of LMRESs continuing operations. The pre tax earnings and cash flows from the operations of LMRES that were sold are not material to our consolidated results of operations. The financial results of the operations sold are reflected as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Legg Masons assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, collateralized short term receivables, investment advisory fee receivables, securities owned and borrowed, intangible assets and goodwill. Our assets are principally funded by payables to customers, securities loaned, bank loans, long term debt and equity. The collateralized short term receivables consist primarily of margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, all of which are collateralized by U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt and equity securities. The investment advisory fee receivables, although not collateralized, are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds, commercial paper and securities purchased under agreements to resell. The highly liquid nature of our assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. Legg Masons total assets increased $1.2 billion to $7.3 billion at March 31, 2004, primarily as a result of increases in securities borrowed of $313.2 million, cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations of $293.0 million, cash of $177.3 million and an increase in receivables from customers of $170.9 million. The increase in securities borrowed was accompanied by a corresponding increase in securities loaned of $267.8 million, reflecting a higher demand for equity securities. The increase in securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations was accompanied by a corresponding increase in payables to customers of $329.8 million. As of March 31, 2004, stockholders equity was $1.560 billion, a 25% increase over March 31, 2003, primarily from the results of operations for the year. For fiscal 2004, cash flows from operating activities provided approximately $189.4 million, primarily attributable to net earnings, adjusted for non cash charges. We expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will be the primary source of working capital for the next year. As of March 31, 2004, Legg Mason had three long term fixed rate debt facilities with an outstanding balance of $794.2 million, an increase of $7.5 million over the prior year due to accretion of our zero coupon notes. We had outstanding $100.0 million principal amount of senior notes due February 15, 2006, which bear interest at a stated rate of 6.5%. The balance at March 31, 2004, was $99.9 million. The notes were originally issued in February 1996 at a discount to yield 6.57%. We also had outstanding $567.0 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due on June 6, 2031, that resulted in net proceeds of $244.4 million. The balance at March 31, 2004 was $270.0 million. The convertible notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers at an initial offering price of $440.70 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. The discounted price reflects a yield to maturity of 2.75% per year. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion trigger price of $73.15 for at least 20 trading days in the last 30 trading days of the quarter. As a result, each note became convertible into 7.7062 shares of our common stock, or 4.4 million shares in aggregate, subject to adjustment, commencing on January 2, 2004. We may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after June 6, 2006 at their accreted value; however, the notes may be converted prior to any redemption. In addition, we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders, on June 6, 2005, 2007, 2011, and every five years thereafter until 2026 or upon a change in control of Legg Mason that occurs on or before June 6, 2006. Such repurchases can be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both. We also had outstanding $425.0 million principal amount of senior notes due 42 July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The balance at March 31, 2004 was $424.3 million. Proceeds from our long term debt were used to fund the acquisition of asset management entities. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2004 were BBB+ for Standard and Poors Rating Services and A3 for Moodys Investor Service, Inc. The Standard and Poors Rating Services rating increased in November 2003 from BBB. On August 1, 2001, Legg Mason purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction includes two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. Based on current revenue levels of PCM, we will be required to make the third anniversary payment of $400.0 million. Additionally, if PCMs revenues remain at current levels or increase, it is likely we will be required to make the fifth anniversary payment of $300.0 million. On October 1, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Royce for cash of $115.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction includes three contingent payments based on Royces revenue growth for the years ending on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $215.0 million. Based on current revenue levels of Royce, we will be required to make an additional payment of the remaining $100.0 million in fiscal 2005. We have the option to pay as much as 50% of the remaining purchase price for Royce in common stock. We currently expect to fund these fiscal 2005 commitments with available cash. As of March 31, 2004, we had $575.0 million available for the issuance of additional debt or equity securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement. A shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable. We intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of our business. There are no assurances as to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they are dependent on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance. During fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized Legg Mason, at its discretion, to purchase up to three million shares of its own common stock. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we repurchased 789,300 shares for $65.4 million, 884,900 shares for $42.0 million and 136,800 shares for $7.1 million, respectively. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid cash dividends of $35.2 million, $28.2 million and $21.5 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. The Parents broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. As of March 31, 2004, the broker dealer subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of $408.6 million, which exceeded minimum net capital requirements by $383.3 million. The amount of the broker dealers net assets that may be distributed is subject to restrictions under applicable net capital rules. The Parents trust subsidiary is subject to the requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which requires compliance with regulatory capital standards. As of March 31, 2004, the trust subsidiary met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC, include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as under contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Special Purposes Entities under Critical Accounting Policies. In connection with the sale of certain assets of LMRES, we provided customary indemnifications to the purchaser. We do not believe there will be any material obligations from these indemnifications. In addition, our broker dealer subsidiaries enter into transactions in the normal course of business that expose us to off balance sheet risk, which are described in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments Legg Mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 2, 7, 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. 43 The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations at March 31, 2004 (In millions) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term borrowings by contract maturity(a) $ $ 378.9 $ $ $ 425.0 $ $ 803.9 Coupon interest on long term borrowings 35.2 31.9 28.7 28.7 14.3 138.8 Minimum rental commitments 66.8 56.4 48.8 44.1 39.3 77.7 333.1 Total Contractual Obligations $ 102.0 $ 467.2 $ 77.5 $ 72.8 $ 478.6 $ 77.7 $ 1,275.8 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(b) 504.3 2.1 300.0 806.4 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(c) $ 606.3 $ 469.3 $ 377.5 $ 72.8 $ 478.6 $ 77.7 $ 2,082.2 (a) Included in the payments in 2006 is $278.9, reflecting amounts that may be due to holders of the zero coupon convertible senior notes, which represents the accreted value on the next possible date that the holders may require us to purchase the notes. Legg Mason has the option to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock or a combination of both. (b) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (c) The table above does not include approximately $18.1 in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2005 to 2011. These capital commitments also include $0.5 of commitments to lend employees funds to invest in one of these partnerships. Risk Management Risk is an inherent part of our business. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our soundness and profitability. The primary risks which we seek to manage are: market, credit, operational, legal and funding. Risk management at Legg Mason is a multi faceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and utilizes specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. We utilize a variety of committees in our risk management framework. The Risk Management Committee (RMC) sets broad based risk policies consistent with the business objectives of Legg Mason. We also have committees that report to the RMC, all of which have representation by senior management of both the relevant business units and the support and control functions within Legg Mason. These committees are intended to ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and businesses, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review. Equity and Fixed Income Commitment Committees approve our participation in the underwriting of equity and fixed income securities. The PCG and Capital Markets New Business and Products (NB&P) Committee evaluates and approves proposed new business initiatives, or proposed changes to existing businesses which may increase the risk profile of the firm. In evaluating a proposed new initiative or business change, the NB&P Committee is assisted by Legg Mason support units such as legal, compliance, operations, finance, regulatory and information technology. 44 The Asset Management Risk Management Committee evaluates and approves proposed new business initiatives, or proposed changes to existing businesses, in our Asset Management segment. It also establishes and monitors procedures to control the operational, compliance, market, credit and legal risks specific to our Asset Management segment. The Credit Committee establishes policies for, and monitors the related risks of, counterparty credit and market risk exposure created through margin lending, equity and fixed income proprietary trading, securities lending, correspondent clearing and institutional sales. In addition, the Credit Committee establishes policies including size and aging limits for trading securities owned by the firm that are used to facilitate customer securities transactions. Our risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Because risk management is a continuous process that seeks to manage rather than eliminate risks, no assurance can be given as to the effect on Legg Mason of any risk, or that any or all risks will actually be properly managed. Funding risk is discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, implied volatilities, correlations, or other market factors such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We make dealer markets in a variety of debt and equity securities and accordingly hold these securities in our inventory accounts. We also hold security positions in inventory to facilitate customer orders. These holdings subject us to market risk. The majority of our trading security inventory consists of debt instruments for which we attempt to hedge or reduce the market risk by holding offsetting positions in other trading securities with similar characteristics or financial instruments such as options or futures. Due to imperfections in correlations between the trading security being hedged and the hedging instrument, gains and losses can occur even for security positions that are hedged. The equity securities in our trading security inventory primarily result from our acting as a market maker for certain securities traded on NASDAQ, and from executing and clearing large blocks of equity securities for our clients. Virtually all of our trading inventory is denominated in U.S. dollars, therefore minimizing foreign exchange risk. We do not deal in, or hold, interest rate or currency swaps or other similar off balance sheet instruments. We generally do not deal in, or hold, commodity futures. Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. We have established a variety of limits, at business unit and trading desk levels, to lessen our exposure to market risk. These limits include aggregate long market value, aggregate short market value, aging, and concentration. Our various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed on an intra day basis and within the limits as set by management. Compliance with these limits is also monitored on a daily basis by a support area independent of the business units. Limit exceptions, if any, are communicated to both the applicable business unit and senior management on a daily basis, and to the Credit Committee. The following tables categorize Legg Masons market risk sensitive financial instruments by type of security and maturity date. The Fair Value of Trading Securities below reflects our Trading assets net of our Trading liabilities, excluding those of consolidated variable interest entities, which is consistent with the way we manage our risk exposure. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the related gross long and short fair values of our trading securities. The Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments includes Investment securities, in addition to treasury securities of $242.2 million and $82.6 million at March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, included in Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations. 45 Financial Instruments with Market Risk at March 31, 2004 Fiscal Year (In thousands) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fair Value of Trading Securities U.S. Government and agencies $ (25 ) $ (15,918 ) $ 7,291 $ 4,727 $ (22,386 ) $ 33,775 $ 7,464 Corporate debt 136 9 228 (7,861 ) 2,833 6,338 1,683 State and municipal bonds 5,614 4,244 737 4,435 1,647 108,521 125,198 Total debt securities 5,725 (11,665 ) 8,256 1,301 (17,906 ) 148,634 134,345 Equity and other securities 7,308 7,308 Total trading securities $ 5,725 $ (11,665 ) $ 8,256 $ 1,301 $ (17,906 ) $ 155,942 $ 141,653 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments U.S. Government and agencies $ 242,185 $ $ $ $ 480 $ 2,714 $ 245,379 Corporate debt 1,550 742 1,593 389 4,274 Total debt securities 243,735 742 1,593 389 480 2,714 249,653 Equity and other securities 30,807 30,807 Total other financial instruments $ 243,735 $ 742 $ 1,593 $ 389 $ 480 $ 33,521 $ 280,460 Total trading and other financial instruments $ 249,460 $ (10,923 ) $ 9,849 $ 1,690 $ (17,426 ) $ 189,463 $ 422,113 Weighted Average Yield U.S. Government and agencies 4.08 % 1.09 % 2.30 % 1.67 % 2.16 % 4.15 % Corporate debt 1.89 5.62 3.53 3.90 4.45 5.01 State and municipal bonds 4.45 3.05 3.63 3.54 2.80 3.79 Financial Instruments with Market Risk at March 31, 2003 Fiscal Year (In thousands) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Fair Value of Trading Securities U.S. Government and agencies $ 4,913 $ (4,035 ) $ 3,199 $ 3,006 $ 5,771 $ 15,955 $ 28,809 Corporate debt 221 1,640 379 4,190 316 11,939 18,685 State and municipal bonds 3,033 1,404 8,857 1,366 3,352 52,123 70,135 Total debt securities 8,167 (991 ) 12,435 8,562 9,439 80,017 117,629 Equity and other securities 2,477 2,477 Total trading securities $ 8,167 $ (991 ) $ 12,435 $ 8,562 $ 9,439 $ 82,494 $ 120,106 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments U.S. Government and agencies $ 83,036 $ $ $ $ $ 3,408 $ 86,444 Corporate debt 1,628 510 259 21 2,418 Total debt securities 84,664 510 259 3,429 88,862 Equity and other securities 20,054 20,054 Total other financial instruments $ 84,664 $ 510 $ 259 $ $ $ 23,483 $ 108,916 Total trading and other financial instruments $ 92,831 $ (481 ) $ 12,694 $ 8,562 $ 9,439 $ 105,977 $ 229,022 Weighted Average Yield U.S. Government and agencies 2.19 % 1.04 % 3.34 % 3.56 % 2.47 % 4.56 % Corporate debt 3.72 6.17 5.45 5.87 4.76 5.54 State and municipal bonds 1.62 4.77 2.31 3.64 2.57 3.69 46 In addition to the financial instruments included in the table, we have three long term debt facilities, which are described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are impacted by fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations are recorded as a component of Stockholders Equity and are not material to our financial condition. The impact of currency fluctuations during the year on our results of operations was not material. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client, counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by Legg Mason fails to perform its contractual obligations to us. We follow industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral. Credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which are monitored daily. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform sensitivity analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. Operational Risk Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from operating activities, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes. We operate different businesses in diverse markets and we are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process high volumes of transactions often within limited time frames. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, we have procedures requiring that all securities transactions must be confirmed on a timely basis, that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances. We also use periodic self assessments, internal audit reviews and independent consultants as a further check on operational risk and exposure. Disaster recovery plans exist for our critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. We believe that our disaster recovery program, including off site back up technology and operational facilities, is adequate to handle a reasonable business disruption. However, there can be no assurances that a disaster directly affecting our headquarters or our operations centers would not have a material adverse impact. Insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses. Legal Risk Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have various procedures addressing issues, such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, protection of client information, collection activities, money laundering and record keeping. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of Legg Mason. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. 47 Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations, Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Trading assets, Investment securities and Trading liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. Where available, we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices, broker or dealer price quotations or external pricing sources. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires management to estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of the same security without restriction, but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. In addition, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. We generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if sold, and that any such sale would occur in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value received upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value. We evaluate our non trading securities for other than temporary impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, we owned approximately $3.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of non trading financial instruments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates. Additionally, we had approximately $0.1 million of unrealized losses on investment securities at March 31, 2004 and 2003. Intangible Assets and Goodwill SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, it provides that the cost of an acquired entity must be allocated to the assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition. The excess cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired must be recognized as goodwill. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, provides that goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset must be amortized over its useful life, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired, primarily asset management contracts and trade names, based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds and the value of trade names are classified as indefinite life intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage proprietary mutual funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. The assignment of indefinite lives to trade names is based on the assumption that they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. As of March 31, 2004, we had $466.2 million in goodwill, $159.9 million in indefinite life intangible assets and $284.5 million in amortizable intangible assets. Generally, the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets range from 5 to 20 years. 48 We review our intangible assets and goodwill on a quarterly basis, considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue multiples, to determine whether the value of the assets is impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment, and is deemed to be impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues and discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Substantially all of our goodwill is assigned to the asset management operating segment. We have defined the asset management reporting units to be wealth management, institutional and mutual funds. During fiscal 2003, Legg Mason recorded an impairment charge of $2.8 million, of which $2.0 million represented the fair value of asset management contracts, acquired in a prior business combination, that were deemed to be impaired due to declining profit margins. The remainder of the impairment charge represented the fair value of asset management contracts, acquired in a prior business combination, that were terminated during the period. If actual results vary from the estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values assigned to assets, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge that could be material to our results. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM and Royce, involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Generally, contingent payments are recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Reserves for Losses and Contingencies Legg Mason is the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities, including certain class actions, which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages, which could be substantial. Legg Mason has also been involved in governmental and self regulatory agency investigations and proceedings. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, we have established reserves for potential losses from such complaints, legal actions, investigations and proceedings. In establishing these reserves, we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses have been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses. In making these decisions, we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations, consultations with legal counsel and our experience. If our judgments prove to be incorrect, our reserves may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions, which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined. As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, our reserves for losses and contingencies were $31.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively. A substantial amount of the increase is due to a copyright infringement lawsuit. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies. Special Purpose Entities Special purpose entities (SPEs) are trusts, partnerships, corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose. SPEs generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement, derive continued benefit, exhibit control or have recourse. As of March 31, 2004, we do not utilize SPEs as a form of financing or to provide liquidity, nor have we recognized any gains or losses from the sale of assets to SPEs. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation Number (FIN) 46. FIN 46 requires that all SPEs be designated as either a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE), with VIEs subject to consolidation by the party deemed to be the primary beneficiary, if any. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinate financial support or in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the entity that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or if there is no such 49 entity, the entity that will receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. The initial implementation of FIN 46 was required for periods beginning after June 15, 2003; however, during October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date for interests in VIEs that were created before February 1, 2003 until the end of the first interim period ending after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 (FIN 46 R) to incorporate certain modifications, which among other things, removed the requirement to include gross fees paid to a decision maker in the determination of expected residual returns. As a result, it is unlikely we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients unless our ownership interest in VIEs were to be substantial. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46 R as of December 31, 2003. In the normal course of our business activities, we obtain variable interests in VIEs that we manage primarily for our clients. We are the collateral manager of collateralized debt obligation entities, the general partner, and in some cases a limited partner, in investment partnerships and the investment manager and or managing member in limited liability companies, trusts and offshore investment vehicles. These entities are investment vehicles and include many types of investment strategies including real estate, equity and fixed income portfolios. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. We did not sell or transfer assets to any of the VIEs. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. We do not issue any performance guarantees to these VIEs or their investors. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were immaterial at March 31, 2004. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned by and paid to us, related party ownership and guarantees. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE including investment returns, cash flows and credit risks. These assumptions and estimates have a significant bearing on the determination of the primary beneficiary. If our assumptions or estimates were to be materially incorrect, we might be required to consolidate additional VIEs. Consolidation of these VIEs would result in an increase to assets with a corresponding increase in liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and an increase in net revenues with a corresponding increase in expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As a result of the adoption of FIN 46 R, at March 31, 2004, we were required to consolidate one investment partnership and two investment trusts with total assets of $13.1 million solely due to the underlying ownership of these entities being comprised of employees interests. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the trading assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs. We do not have an ownership interest in these entities and as such the net equity of these entities is reflected as minority interest in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Our assets, exclusive of the assets of the consolidated VIEs, are not subject to claims of creditors of these consolidated VIEs and likewise the assets of the consolidated VIEs are not available to our creditors. In addition, the results of operations of these consolidated VIEs are immaterial. 50 As of March 31, 2004, the following table is a summary of the VIEs in which we have a significant variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary (dollars in millions): Entity Type Numberof Entities TotalAssets EquityInvestment CapitalCommitments Date ofEarliest Involvement CDOs 5 $1,972 $ $ August 2000 Offshore Investment Vehicles(1) 3 1,197 August 1995 Trusts 13 1,010 November 1993 Limited Partnerships/REITs 11 494 14 17 September 1986 Limited Liability Companies(2) 3 26 March 2001 Total 35 $4,699 $ 14 $ 17 (1) Includes one money market fund with assets of $1.1 billion in which we believe we have less than a 1% variable interest. (2) Excludes 4 limited liability companies in which one of our asset management subsidiaries has approximately $17.9 million invested by its long term incentive plan. We do not have a direct variable interest since we do not earn any fees on these assets. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation and retention bonuses payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue stock options to officers, key employees and non employee members of the Board of Directors. Prior to April 1, 2003, we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended. In accordance with APB No. 25, compensation expense was not recognized for stock options that have no intrinsic value (the exercise price is not less than the market price) on the date of grant prior to fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, we adopted the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, prospectively for all stock options granted and stock purchase plan transactions after April 1, 2003, using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Under the prospective method allowed under SFAS No. 148, compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of stock options granted after April 1, 2003 over the applicable vesting period. No compensation expense is recognized for stock options granted prior to April 1, 2003. Therefore, the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for March 31, 2004 is less than that which would have been included if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Under the stock purchase plan, shares of common stock are purchased in the open market on behalf of participating employees and we provide a 10% contribution towards purchases, which is recognized as expense. Restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock are recognized as expense over the vesting periods. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 148, we provide disclosure in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the pro forma results under the modified prospective fair value based method, as if compensation expense associated with prior years stock option grants had been recognized over the vesting period. The fair value of each option grant is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. If we accounted for prior years stock option grants under the modified prospective fair value based method, net earnings would have been reduced by $17.3 million, $22.1 million and $20.9 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. We also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our income tax provision by recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we estimate will not be ultimately recoverable. We recorded a valuation allowance related to U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards and non U.S. net operating and capital loss carryforwards, since it is unlikely that these benefits will be realized. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If we determine that our estimates have changed, the income tax provision will be adjusted in the period in which that determination is made. 51 Forward Looking Statements Information or statements provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason from time to time, including those within this Report on Form 10 K, may contain certain forward looking information, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of client assets under management, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. We caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to those discussed below, those discussed under the heading Factors Affecting the Company and the Financial Services Industry and those discussed elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of assets under management; the volume of trading in securities; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; the level of margin and customer account balances; competitive conditions in each of our business segments; the demand for investment banking services; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of net revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. Effects of Inflation Based on todays low inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, securities and receivables, we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation. The rate of inflation, however, can affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Recent Accounting Developments The FASB has issued the following pronouncements during fiscal 2004. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. In addition, the statement clarifies when a contract is a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is generally effective prospectively for contracts entered into or modified, and hedging relationships designated, after June 30, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity, and imposes certain additional disclosure requirements. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 are generally effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 52 In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, as it relates to disclosures of SFAS No. 115 securities. In addition to the disclosures already required by SFAS No. 115, EITF Issue 03 01 requires both quantitative and qualitative disclosures for marketable equity and debt securities. The new disclosure requirements are required to be applied to financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Adoption of EITF 03 01 did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 R, as previously discussed. Adoption of FIN 46 R, except for added disclosure, did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. See Item 7.
