ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Overview Legg Mason, Inc. (the Parent), a holding company, and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, Legg Mason) are principally engaged in providing asset management, securities brokerage, investment banking and related financial services to individuals, institutions, corporations and municipalities. We have operations principally in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada and also have offices in Spain, Switzerland and Singapore. Terms such as we, us, our and company refer to Legg Mason. We currently operate in the following business segments: Asset Management, Private Client and Capital Markets. The corporate revenues and expenses that are not allocated to the business segments are reported separately as Corporate. Business segment classifications are based upon factors such as the services provided and distribution channels utilized. Certain services that we offer are provided to clients through more than one of our business segments. We allocate certain common income and expense items among our business segments based upon various methodologies and factors. These methodologies are by their nature subjective and are reviewed periodically by management. Business segment results may reflect reallocations of revenues and expenses that result from changes in methodologies, but any reallocations will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations. There were no material changes in methodologies during fiscal 2005. Asset Management provides investment advisory services to institutional and individual clients and to company sponsored investment funds. The primary sources of revenue in Asset Management are investment advisory, distribution and administrative fees, which typically are calculated as a percentage of the assets in the account and vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management and the type of services that are provided. In addition, performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in Asset Management when the fund is sold through its marketing channels and in the Private Client segment when the fund is sold through its branch distribution network. Revenues from Asset Management tend to be more stable than those from Private Client and Capital Markets because they are less affected by changes in securities market conditions. Private Client distributes a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client are commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fee based account fees and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment are reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. Capital Markets consists of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance investment banking. The primary sources of revenue for equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading include commissions and principal credits on transactions in both corporate and municipal products. We maintain proprietary fixed income and equity securities inventory primarily to facilitate customer transactions and as a result recognize trading profits and losses from our proprietary trading activities. Investment banking revenues include underwriting fees and advisory fees from private placements and mergers and acquisitions. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings are reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also include realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities. In September 2003, we sold the mortgage banking and servicing operation of Legg Mason Real Estate Services, Inc. (LMRES), which had been previously reported in Other. Other also included certain unallocated corporate revenues and expenses. Consolidated results for fiscal 2003 have been restated to reflect the historical results of the sold business as discontinued operations and the remaining operations of LMRES in Capital Markets. The corporate revenues and expenses that are not allocated to the business segments are now reported separately as Corporate. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes sales commissions that are based upon certain revenues and incentive bonuses that are primarily based upon production levels and or profitability. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, equipment leasing and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and may not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, may not rise proportionately with increased business activity. 34 Table of Contents Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, the volume of trading in securities, the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, the level of customer margin and credit account balances and the demand for investment banking services, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. The financial services businesses in which we are engaged are extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous national, regional and local asset management firms and broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been affected by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers or acquisitions. The increasing competitive pressures may require us to offer our customers many of the services provided by much larger firms. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws and by securities exchanges and other self regulatory authorities. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes in the post Enron era. In addition, the financial services industry has been the subject of a number of regulatory proceedings and requirements over the last three years, including changes in the relationships of research analysts and investment banking and proceedings regarding a number of mutual funds sales practices. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 has required us to implement new policies or review existing policies with respect to corporate governance, auditor independence and internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, various regulatory organizations adopted changes to their rules and policies in response to certain abuses and corporate scandals. Responding to these changes has required us to add employees and incur costs that have impacted our profitability. All references to fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Business Environment Fiscal 2005 began with uncertainty, as the U.S. presidential and first Iraqi elections approached and the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated plans to increase the federal funds rate at a measured pace. During fiscal 2005, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented seven 0.25% increases to bring the federal funds rate to 2.75%, up from fiscal 2004s 1.0%, the lowest level in 45 years. The major equity markets exhibited volatility throughout fiscal 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,1 the Nasdaq2 Composite Index and the S&P 5003 were up 4%, 9% and 8%, respectively, through December 31, 2004 but ended our fiscal year up 1%, unchanged and up 5%, respectively. The market environment for fixed income investments remained extremely challenging. Interest rates, overall, have remained volatile, though with an upside bias. Fixed income investors generally remain cautious, and overall flows and activity in the bond markets have slowed significantly. Thus, the equity and fixed income markets continue to be uncertain and we are unable to predict the impact this will have on our future results. The financial services industry continues to be impacted by legislative and regulatory changes. Participants in the industry have responded and reacted to numerous regulatory investigations and inquiries, proposals and adoptions of new regulations and revised and enhanced interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Regulatory investigations into mutual fund trading practices within the financial services industry have uncovered instances of conflicts of interest and insufficient internal controls related to mutual funds and have resulted in a negative public perception of the mutual fund industry, numerous regulatory proposals, a strict regulatory environment and significant fines and penalties against, and fee reductions by, a number of financial services companies. 1 Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason. 2 Nasdaq is a trademark of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., which is not affiliated with Legg Mason. 3 S&P 500 is a trademark of Standard & Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., which is not affiliated with Legg Mason. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Net Revenues Period to Period Change* Years EndedMarch 31, 2005Compared to 2004 2004Compared to 2003 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees 68.8 % 62.7 % 57.3 % 36.1 % 41.5 % Commissions 14.9 17.7 21.1 4.3 8.5 Principal transactions 6.7 8.5 10.5 (2.4 ) 4.6 Investment banking 5.7 7.7 7.3 (8.5 ) 37.7 Interest 4.9 4.3 7.1 40.8 (20.6 ) Other 2.4 2.3 2.4 30.9 22.3 Total revenues 103.4 103.2 105.7 24.2 26.3 Interest expense 3.4 3.2 5.7 28.0 (26.6 ) Net revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 24.1 29.4 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 54.6 56.0 58.7 21.0 23.6 Communications and technology 4.7 5.0 6.2 18.0 3.0 Occupancy 2.9 3.4 4.2 4.1 6.1 Distribution and service fees 3.1 2.5 1.6 57.5 94.4 Amortization of intangible assets 1.0 1.1 1.5 3.6 (6.5 ) Litigation award charge 1.0 n/m n/m Other 6.4 6.7 7.3 18.1 19.0 Total non interest expenses 72.7 75.7 79.5 19.1 23.1 Earnings from Continuing Operationsbefore Income Tax Provision 27.3 24.3 20.5 39.5 53.9 Income tax provision 10.3 9.3 7.9 37.7 54.7 Earnings from Continuing Operations 17.0 15.0 12.6 40.5 53.4 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.1 n/m n/m Gain on sale of discontinuedoperations, net of taxes 0.3 n/m n/m Net Earnings 17.0 % 15.3 % 12.7 % 37.2 56.0 n/m not meaningful * Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 36 Table of Contents FISCAL 2005 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2004 Financial Overview Legg Mason reported record net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005. Net revenues increased 24% to $2.4 billion, primarily due to increased revenues from higher assets under management. Assets under management increased 30% to $372.9 billion, primarily as a result of positive net client cash flows. Net earnings increased 37% to $408.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $3.53, an increase of 33%. The pre tax profit margin increased to 27.3% from 24.3%. Our earnings per share in fiscal 2005 included the weighted impact of 4.6 million shares that were issued in an underwritten offering of our common stock in December 2004, for net proceeds of approximately $311 million. All share and earnings per share numbers have been restated, where appropriate, for a 3 for 2 stock split effective September 24, 2004. Included in fiscal 2004 is a single litigation award charge of $19.0 million resulting from a jury verdict and subsequent judgment in a civil copyright infringement lawsuit. Net Revenues Investment advisory and related fees, including distribution fees from company sponsored mutual and offshore funds, increased 36% to $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of the combined growth from assets managed by Private Capital Management, L.P. (PCM), Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset), Royce & Associates, LLC (Royce) and Legg Mason Capital Management (LMCM, which includes the combined operations of Legg Mason Capital Management and Legg Mason Funds Management). Distribution fees from proprietary investment funds increased $51.1 million to $241.2 million. Investment advisory and related fees represented 69% of consolidated net revenues, up from 63% in the prior year. Investment Advisory Revenues and Assets Under Management Assets under management at March 31, 2005 were $372.9 billion, up $86.5 billion or 30% from March 31, 2004. Net client cash flows were responsible for just under 75% of the increase, with market performance, including currency translation, accounting for 20% and the December 31, 2004 acquisition of four offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel responsible for the remainder. The strong increase in assets under management at Western Asset, our principal fixed income manager, was the primary driver in our equity assets declining as a percentage of our total managed assets, from 39% a year ago to 38% at March 31, 2005. Our Institutional asset management division was responsible for 66% of total managed assets at yearend, our Mutual Funds division was responsible for 21% and our Wealth Management division was responsible for 13%. Assets under management as of March 31, 2005 and 2004 by type are as follows: 2005* % ofTotal 2004* % ofTotal %Change Equity $ 142.9 38.3 $ 112.3 39.2 27.3 % Fixed Income 230.0 61.7 174.1 60.8 32.1 % Total $ 372.9 100.0 $ 286.4 100.0 30.2 % * In billions Assets Under Management by Division (In billions)** ** Legg Mason Investments Holdings Limited was moved from the Institutional division to the Mutual Funds division for fiscal 2005 to reflect the change in focus of their business from managing assets to distributing investment funds. This change had no material impact on assets under management presented above. 37 Table of Contents Securities brokerage revenues, including both commissions and principal transactions, increased 2% to $519.9 million, primarily as a result of increases in distribution fees from non proprietary mutual funds, partially offset by decreases in institutional fixed income trading volume. Commission revenues in fiscal 2004 were reduced by $7.4 million for reimbursements to certain clients for our failure to provide breakpoint discounts in connection with client purchases of non proprietary front end load mutual fund shares. Investment banking revenues were $137.3 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior year, primarily as a result of a 44% decrease in retail selling concessions, partially offset by increases in municipal banking and corporate advisory fees. Other revenues increased 31% to $57.4 million, primarily as a result of increased values of firm investments, revenue sharing payments from non proprietary mutual funds and customer account service fees. Net interest profit of $37.9 million increased 79% from $21.2 million in the prior year. Interest revenue increased 41% to $118.7 million as a result of substantially higher interest rates earned on customer margin account balances and firm investments. Interest expense increased 28% to $80.8 million as a result of significantly higher interest rates paid on customer credit balances. The net interest profit margin in the current period increased to 31.9% from 25.1% in the prior year, and net interest profit accounted for 5.7% of earnings before income tax provision, up from 4.5% in the prior year. Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 21% to $1.3 billion, as a result of increases in profitability based incentive costs, primarily asset management related, and fixed salaries and benefits primarily as a result of an increased number of full time employees. However, compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 54.6% from 56.0% in the prior year, primarily as a result of a significant increase in revenues from the Asset Management segment that has an overall lower compensation ratio and the impact of fixed compensation costs on significantly higher revenues. Communications and technology expense increased 18% to $113.6 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of higher technology equipment depreciation, consulting costs and quote service. The relocation of Western Asset to a new office facility was a significant contributor to the increases in technology equipment depreciation and consulting costs. Occupancy expense rose 4% to $69.2 million in the current year, primarily as a result of increased rent and operating expenses related to Western Assets relocation. Amortization of intangible assets increased 4% to $22.5 million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of four wealth management offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel by Legg Mason Investment Counsel in December 2004. In the prior fiscal year, we recorded a litigation award charge of $19.0 million as a result of a jury verdict and subsequent judgment in a copyright infringement lawsuit (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Distribution and service fees increased 57% to $75.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in distribution fees paid to third party distributors on increased sales and subsequent growth of offshore and Royce funds. Other expenses increased 18% to $153.7 million in the current fiscal year, primarily as a result of higher promotional costs, increases in management fees related to our international equity sales offices and an increase in professional fees, principally audit and consulting fees as a result of increased legislative and regulatory requirements. The prior year included a $2.3 million fine levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) as a result of our failure to provide certain clients the benefit of breakpoint discounts in connection with their purchases of non proprietary front end load mutual fund shares. The provision for income taxes increased 38% to $250.3 million, primarily as a result of the increase in pre tax earnings. The effective tax rate declined to 38.0% from 38.5% in the prior years period due to a lower provision for income tax uncertainties in the current year and the impact of non deductible breakpoint fines in the prior year. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2003 Financial Overview Legg Mason achieved then record net revenues, net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2004. Net revenues increased 29% to $1.9 billion, primarily due to increased revenues from higher assets under management. Assets under management increased 49% to $286.4 billion as a result of approximately equal increases in net client cash flows and market appreciation. Net earnings increased 56% to $297.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.65, an increase of 49%. The pre tax profit margin increased to 24.3% from 20.5%. Included in fiscal 2004 is a single litigation award charge of $19.0 million. Our fiscal 2004 earnings were also affected by the impact of the sale of the mortgage servicing operations of LMRES, which increased net earnings by $6.5 million. Diluted earnings per share and weighted average diluted shares outstanding have been restated as required by EITF 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share. Therefore, our diluted earnings per share for both fiscal years now include the impact of 6.6 million shares that are issuable upon conversion of our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes. Previously, the senior notes were not included until the notes became convertible in January 2004. 38 Table of Contents Net Revenues Investment advisory and related fees, including distribution fees from company sponsored mutual and offshore funds, increased 42% to $1.2 billion, primarily as a result of the combined growth from assets managed by PCM, Western Asset, Royce and LMCM. Distribution fees from proprietary investment funds increased $53.0 million to $190.1 million. Investment advisory and related fees represented 63% of consolidated net revenues, up from 57% in fiscal 2003. Assets under management at March 31, 2004 were $286.4 billion, up 49% from March 31, 2003. Changes in the business environment during fiscal 2004, which gave rise to improvements in the equity markets, resulted in dramatic growth in our equity assets under management. Over $50 billion of the $94 billion increase in assets was in equity assets. Because we earn higher fees on our equity products, pre tax earnings rose 77% in our Asset Management segment. Securities brokerage revenues increased 7% to $509.0 million, primarily as a result of increases in retail client transaction volume, particularly listed and over the counter equities and non affiliated mutual funds. Commission revenues in fiscal 2004 were reduced by $7.4 million for reimbursements to certain clients for our failure to provide breakpoint discounts in connection with client purchases of non proprietary front end load mutual fund shares and $5.6 million as a result of the impact of the sale of our bank brokerage network in fiscal 2003. Investment banking revenues were $150.1 million, an increase of 38% over the prior year, primarily as a result of increases in retail and institutional selling concessions and corporate banking management fees from new issues. Other revenues increased 22% to $43.8 million, primarily as a result of net gains on firm investments. Net interest profit of $21.2 million increased 5% from $20.2 million in fiscal 2003. Interest revenue declined 21% to $84.3 million as a result of significantly lower interest rates earned on higher average customer and firm investment balances. Interest expense declined 27% to $63.2 million as a result of significantly lower interest rates paid on customer credit account balances and lower amortized issue costs relating to our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes, which were fully amortized in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The net interest profit margin in fiscal 2004 increased to 25.1% from 19.0% in the prior year, and accounted for 4.5% of earnings before income tax provision, down from 6.6% in the prior year. Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 24% to $1.1 billion, as a result of increases in profitability based incentive costs, primarily asset management related, and increased retail financial advisor sales compensation. However, compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 56.0% from 58.7% in the prior year, as a result of the impact of fixed compensation costs on increased revenues, a lower percentage of pre tax profits accrued for corporate executive incentive compensation and lower effective compensation rates. Communications and technology expense of $96.3 million increased 3% from $93.4 million in fiscal 2003, as increased investments in technology were partially offset by the impact of lower depreciation as a result of assets that became fully depreciated in a prior year. Occupancy expense rose 6% to $66.5 million in fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of increased rent, equipment depreciation and relocation costs of $1.7 million related to Western Assets move to a new office location. We also incurred $1.0 million of additional costs to consolidate two investment advisory subsidiary office locations in New York City. Amortization of intangible assets declined 6% to $21.8 million, primarily as a result of asset management contracts that were fully amortized during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, we recorded a litigation award charge of $19.0 million as a result of a jury verdict and subsequent judgment in a copyright infringement lawsuit (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Distribution and service fees increased 94% to $47.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in distribution fees paid to third party distributors on sales of offshore and Royce funds. Other expenses increased 19% to $130.1 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to: an increase of $8.0 million in audit and consulting fees as a result of increased legislative and regulatory requirements and legal fees for litigation; a $2.3 million fine related to our failure to provide certain clients the benefit of breakpoint discounts; stock based compensation expense of $2.1 million for stock option grants to our non employee directors; and an increase of $2.0 million in contributions to the Legg Mason charitable foundation. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses related to advances to financial advisors and impairment charges taken on intangible assets in fiscal 2003. The income tax provision increased 55% to $181.7 million, primarily as a result of the increase in pre tax earnings. The effective tax rate was 38.5% in fiscal 2004 and 38.3% in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 reflects a lower average effective foreign tax rate, while the prior year benefited from $2.6 million in state income tax refunds. 39 Table of Contents Results By Segment Asset Management Period to Period Change Years EndedMarch 31, 2005Comparedto 2004 2004Comparedto 2003 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees $ 1,356.4 $ 975.1 $ 668.4 39.1 % 45.9 % Commissions 20.0 17.8 12.6 12.4 41.3 Interest 12.3 9.0 15.1 36.7 (40.4 ) Other 9.5 9.1 1.9 n/m n/m Total revenues 1,398.2 1,011.0 698.0 38.3 44.8 Interest expense 42.7 41.7 49.9 2.4 (16.4 ) Net revenues 1,355.5 969.3 648.1 39.8 49.6 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 638.6 455.9 318.2 40.1 43.3 Other expenses 252.0 197.1 151.2 27.9 30.4 Total non interest expenses 890.6 653.0 469.4 36.4 39.1 Earnings from Continuing Operationsbefore Income Tax Provision $ 464.9 $ 316.3 $ 178.7 47.0 77.0 Profit margin 34.3 % 32.6 % 27.6 % n/m not meaningful 40 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 Net revenues in Asset Management increased 40% to $1.4 billion and pre tax earnings increased 47% to $464.9 million, principally as a result of higher revenues from significantly increased levels of assets under management. Investment advisory and related revenues, including performance fees, increased $381.3 million, with PCM, Western, Royce and LMCM, combined, accounting for $299.3 million (or 78%) of the increase. Performance fees rose $7.4 million to $48.9 million during fiscal 2005. Compensation and benefits expense increased 40%, as a result of increased incentives at subsidiaries operating under revenue sharing arrangements. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues was 47.1% for fiscal 2005, relatively unchanged from 47.0% for fiscal 2004. Other expenses increased $54.9 million, which included a $23.6 million increase in distribution and service fees, primarily paid to third party distributors on increased sales and subsequent growth of our offshore and Royce funds. In addition, other expenses included an increase of $13.6 million in communication and technology and occupancy expenses, primarily related to Western Assets relocation to new office space, and an increase in allocated overhead costs. The pre tax profit margin increased to 34.3% from 32.6% in the prior year. Asset Management represented 56.3% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2005, an increase from 49.9% in the prior year, and 70.6% of pre tax earnings, up from 67.0%. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 Net revenues in Asset Management increased 50% to $969.3 million and pre tax earnings increased 77% to $316.3 million, principally as a result of higher revenues from increased levels of assets under management. Investment advisory and related revenues at PCM, Western Asset, Royce and LMCM, combined, accounted for $238.4 million (or 74%) of the increase, including performance fees. Performance fees rose $20.0 million to $41.5 million. Compensation and benefits expense increased $137.7 million or 43%, as a result of increased incentives at subsidiaries operating under revenue sharing arrangements. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues was 47.0% for fiscal 2004 and 49.1% for fiscal 2003. Other expenses increased $45.9 million, which included a $23.7 million increase in distribution and service fees, primarily paid to third party distributors on increased sales and subsequent growth of our offshore and Royce funds. The pre tax profit margin increased to 32.6% from 27.6% in fiscal 2003. Asset Management represented 49.9% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2004, an increase from 43.2% in fiscal 2003. Net Revenues by Division within Asset Management (In millions)* * Effective fiscal 2005, Legg Mason Investments Holdings Limited was moved from the Institutional division to the Mutual Funds division to reflect the change in focus of their business from managing assets to distributing investment funds. This change resulted in $54.7 million in net revenues being included in the Mutual Funds division rather than in the Institutional division. 41 Table of Contents Private Client Period to Period Change Years EndedMarch 31, 2005Compared to 2004 2004Compared to 2003 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees $ 288.6 $ 229.3 $ 183.0 25.9 % 25.3 % Commissions 237.9 232.8 212.3 2.2 9.7 Principal transactions 86.4 84.7 81.9 2.0 3.4 Investment banking 26.4 47.4 26.6 (44.3 ) 78.2 Interest 95.2 67.6 84.1 40.8 (19.6 ) Other 40.7 34.7 34.9 17.3 (0.6 ) Total revenues 775.2 696.5 622.8 11.3 11.8 Interest expense 34.9 18.7 34.2 86.6 (45.3 ) Net revenues 740.3 677.8 588.6 9.2 15.2 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 422.2 394.9 345.7 6.9 14.2 Other expenses 181.7 162.2 165.3 12.0 (1.9 ) Total non interest expenses 603.9 557.1 511.0 8.4 9.0 Earnings from Continuing Operationsbefore Income Tax Provision $ 136.4 $ 120.7 $ 77.6 13.0 55.5 Profit margin 18.4 % 17.8 % 13.2 % Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 Private Client net revenues increased 9% to $740.3 million from $677.8 million in the prior year and pre tax earnings increased 13% to $136.4 million. Investment advisory and related fees increased $59.3 million, principally as a result of increases in distribution fees on company sponsored mutual funds and fees earned from fee based brokerage accounts. Commissions increased $5.1 million as increased sales of non affiliated mutual funds and the impact of a $7.4 million reduction in mutual fund commissions for breakpoint reimbursements to clients in the prior year were partially offset by lower listed commissions. Investment banking revenues decreased $21.0 million due to a decline in retail corporate selling concessions. Net interest profit in Private Client rose 23% to $60.3 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned on segregated customer and margin account balances and higher levels of customer margin account balances, partially offset by an increase in the interest rates paid on customer credit account balances. Compensation and benefits expense increased $27.3 million, primarily due to increased commissions paid on higher distribution fees from company sponsored mutual funds and fee based brokerage revenues, offset in part by a decline in commissions on corporate selling concessions. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues declined to 57.0% in fiscal 2005 from 58.3% in fiscal 2004. Other expenses increased $19.5 million, primarily as a result of an increase in allocated overhead costs. The pre tax profit margin rose to 18.4% from 17.8% in the prior fiscal year. For the period ended March 31, 2005, Private Client represented 30.7% of consolidated net revenues, a decrease from 34.9% in the prior year, and 20.7% of pre tax earnings, down from 25.6%, primarily due to the significant increase in Asset Management net revenues, which has a higher profit margin. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 Private Client net revenues increased 15% to $677.8 million from $588.6 million in fiscal 2003 and pre tax earnings increased 56% to $120.7 million. Investment advisory and related fees increased $46.3 million, principally as a result of increases in distribution fees on company sponsored mutual funds and fees earned from fee based brokerage accounts. Commissions increased $20.5 million, primarily due to an increased volume of listed and over the counter securities transactions and increased commissions on sales of non affiliated mutual funds. These increases in commissions were partially offset by the impact of the sale of contracts in our bank brokerage network in fiscal 2003 of $9.9 million and the impact of a $7.4 million reduction in mutual fund commissions for breakpoint reimbursements to clients. Additionally, investment banking revenues increased $20.8 million as a result of increases in retail corporate selling concessions. Compensation and benefits expense increased $49.2 million, primarily due to increased commissions paid on higher distribution fees from company sponsored mutual funds, commissions and fee based brokerage revenues. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly to 58.3% in fiscal 2004 from 58.7% in fiscal 2003. The pre tax profit margin rose to 17.8% from 13.2% in fiscal 2003. Private Client represented 34.9% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2004, a decrease from 39.2% in fiscal 2003 due to the significant increase in Asset Management net revenues. 42 Table of Contents Capital Markets Period to Period Change Years EndedMarch 31, 2005Comparedto 2004 2004Comparedto 2003 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Investment advisory and related fees $ 11.3 $ 12.6 $ 9.0 (10.3 )% 40.0 % Commissions 100.5 92.9 91.8 8.2 1.2 Principal transactions 75.1 80.8 76.2 (7.1 ) 6.0 Investment banking 110.9 102.7 82.7 8.0 24.2 Interest 9.9 7.5 7.0 32.0 7.1 Other 6.9 1.4 (0.6 ) n/m n/m Total revenues 314.6 297.9 266.1 5.6 12.0 Interest expense 3.2 2.1 1.9 52.4 10.5 Net revenues 311.4 295.8 264.2 5.3 12.0 Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 177.5 173.2 154.1 2.5 12.4 Other expenses 77.7 67.5 58.5 15.1 15.4 Total non interest expenses 255.2 240.7 212.6 6.0 13.2 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision $ 56.2 $ 55.1 $ 51.6 2.0 6.8 Profit margin 18.0 % 18.6 % 19.5 % n/m not meaningful Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 Capital Markets net revenues increased 5% to $311.4 million from $295.8 million in the prior year and pre tax earnings increased 2% to $56.2 million. Commissions increased $7.6 million, primarily as a result of increased institutional equity transaction volume. Principal transactions decreased $5.7 million, primarily due to a decline in both institutional taxable and municipal fixed income trading volume. Investment banking revenues increased $8.2 million, primarily as a result of higher corporate advisory and underwriting fees and higher municipal advisory fees, partially offset by a decline in corporate banking management fees. Other revenue increased $5.5 million, primarily due to increased values of firm investments. Compensation and benefits expense increased $4.3 million, primarily as a result of an increase in fixed salaries and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in taxable fixed income commissions and the impact of deferring a portion of commission payouts under a new restricted stock program. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 57.0% from 58.6% in the prior year. Other expenses increased $10.2 million, primarily due to an increase in management fees related to our international equity sales offices and an increase in allocated overhead costs. The pre tax profit margin was 18.0% in fiscal 2005, compared to 18.6% in the prior year. Capital Markets represented 12.9% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2005, a decrease from 15.3% in the prior year, and 8.5% of pre tax earnings, down from 11.6%, primarily due to the significant increase in net revenues in our Asset Management segment, which has a higher profit margin. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 Capital Markets net revenues increased 12% to $295.8 million from $264.2 million in fiscal 2003 and pre tax earnings increased 7% to $55.1 million. Principal transactions increased $4.6 million, primarily due to higher over the counter trading volume. Investment banking revenues increased $20.0 million, primarily as a result of higher corporate banking management fees and selling concessions on new issues and higher corporate advisory fees. Compensation and benefits expense increased 12%, primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation and institutional equity commissions. Compensation as a percentage of net revenues was 58.6%, compared to 58.3% in fiscal 2003. Other expenses increased $9.0 million as a result of increased allocated overhead and communication and technology costs. The pre tax profit margin decreased to 18.6% from 19.5% in fiscal 2003. Capital Markets represented 15.3% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2004, a decrease from 17.6% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to the significant increase in net revenues in our Asset Management segment. 43 Table of Contents Corporate Years EndedMarch 31, Period to Period Change 2005Comparedto 2004 2004Comparedto 2003 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Interest $ 1.3 $ 0.3 $ n/m n/m Other 0.2 (1.4 ) (0.6 ) Total revenues 1.5 (1.1 ) (0.6 ) Interest expense 0.7 Net revenues 1.5 (1.8 ) (0.6 ) Non Interest Expenses Compensation and benefits 1.2 Other expenses 0.3 18.0 (0.8 ) Total non interest expenses 0.3 18.0 0.4 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision $ 1.2 $ (19.8 ) $ (1.0 ) n/m not meaningful Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 and 2003 Corporate includes unallocated revenues and expenses, primarily gains and losses on certain firm investments. Fiscal 2004 included $17.5 of the $19.0 million litigation award charge representing the additional amount recorded in September 2003 as a result of the jury verdict and subsequent judgment rendered in the copyright infringement lawsuit. In addition, in September 2003, we sold the mortgage banking and servicing operation of LMRES, which had been previously reported in Corporate. Consolidated results have been restated to reflect the historical results of the sold business as discontinued operations and the remaining operations of LMRES in Capital Markets. 44 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support our business strategies, as well as the regulatory capital requirements of certain of our subsidiaries, and to provide needed liquidity at all times. Liquidity and the access to liquidity are essential to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. On December 21, 2004, Legg Mason sold 4.6 million shares of common stock at $70.30 per share, less underwriting fees, for net proceeds of approximately $311 million. We intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions. As part of our liquidity strategy, we emphasize diversification of funding sources and seek to manage exposure to refinancing risk. Legg Mason has available committed short term financing on both a secured and unsecured basis. Secured financing is obtained through the use of securities lending agreements and secured bank loans, which are primarily collateralized by short term U.S. government and agency securities, highly rated corporate debt, money market funds and equity securities. Short term funding is generally obtained at rates based upon benchmarks such as federal funds, prime, LIBOR or money market rates. We maintain a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility of $100 million that matures on June 30, 2006, for general corporate purposes that may include short term funding needs. The facility has restrictive covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain specified levels of net worth and debt to equity ratios. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of March 31, 2005 and 2004. From time to time, we utilize uncommitted credit facilities from numerous banks and financial institutions, which consist of lines of credit that we have been advised are available, but for which no contractual lending obligation exists. As such, these uncommitted facilities would likely be unavailable to us if any material adverse effect on our financial condition occurred. We have not relied on the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund our operating needs nor do we utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities to provide operating liquidity. Our assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, collateralized short term receivables, investment advisory fee receivables, securities owned and borrowed, intangible assets and goodwill. Our assets are principally funded by payables to customers, securities loaned, bank loans, long term debt and equity. The collateralized short term receivables consist primarily of margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, all of which are collateralized by U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt and equity securities. The investment advisory fee receivables, although not collateralized, are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds, commercial paper and securities purchased under agreements to resell. The highly liquid nature of our assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. Our total assets increased $937.0 million to $8.2 billion at March 31, 2005, primarily as a result of increases in goodwill of $527.2 million, securities borrowed of $216.3 million, and trading assets of $175.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations of $299.1 million reflecting the overall decrease in payables to customers. As of March 31, 2005, stockholders equity was $2.3 billion, a 47% increase over March 31, 2004, primarily from the results of operations for the year and the December 2004 equity offering, offset, in part, by dividends declared and stock repurchases. For fiscal 2005, cash flows from operating activities provided approximately $411.5 million, primarily attributable to net earnings, adjusted for non cash charges. We expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will be the primary source of working capital for the next year. As of March 31, 2005, we had four long term fixed rate debt facilities with an outstanding balance of $811.2 million, an increase of $17.0 million over the prior year primarily attributable to the addition of a $20.0 million term loan agreement at Western Asset, which bears interest at 4.19%. We had outstanding $100.0 million principal amount of senior notes due February 15, 2006, which bear interest at a stated rate of 6.5%. The notes were originally issued in February 1996 at a discount to yield 6.57%. We also had outstanding $545.3 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes due on June 6, 2031. During fiscal 2005, holders of notes aggregating $22.0 million principal amount at maturity converted the notes into 254,304 shares of common stock. The convertible notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers at an initial offering price of $440.70 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. The discounted price reflects a yield to maturity of 2.75% per year. The accreted balance at March 31, 2005 was $266.7 million. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion trigger price. As a result, each note became convertible into 11.5593 45 Table of Contents shares of our common stock, or 6.6 million shares in aggregate, subject to adjustment, commencing on January 2, 2004. We may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after June 6, 2006 at their accreted value; however, the notes may be converted prior to any redemption. In addition, we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders, on June 6, 2005, 2007, 2011, and every five years thereafter until 2026 or upon a change in control of Legg Mason that occurs on or before June 6, 2006. Such repurchases can be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both. Based upon the current price of our stock, we do not expect there will be any convertible notes tendered for repurchase on June 6, 2005, however, if any notes are tendered, we have elected to pay cash. We also had outstanding $425.0 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The accreted balance at March 31, 2005 was $424.5 million. Except for the Western Asset debt, which was used to fund tenant improvements at their new office location, proceeds from our long term debt have been primarily used to fund the acquisition of asset management entities. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2005 were BBB+ for Standard and Poors Rating Services and A3 for Moodys Investor Service, Inc. On August 1, 2001, Legg Mason purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400.0 million to the former owners of PCM. Additionally, if PCMs revenues remain at current levels or increase, we will be required to make the fifth anniversary payment of $300.0 million. On October 1, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Royce for cash of $115.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included contingent payments based on Royces revenue growth, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $215.0 million. During fiscal 2005, we made a contingent payment of $100.0 million to the former owners of Royce, which represented the maximum contingent amount due. The contingent payments were recorded as additional goodwill. On July 20, 2004, Legg Mason declared a three for two stock split, paid as a dividend on September 24, 2004 to stockholders of record on September 8, 2004. Accordingly, all share and per share information has been retroactively restated, where appropriate, to reflect the stock split. The December 21, 2004 equity offering reduced, by the gross proceeds, the amount available for the issuance of additional debt or equity securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement. In March 2005, we filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement, which increased to approximately $1.25 billion at March 31, 2005 the amount we had available for the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. A shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable. We intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of our business. There are no assurances as to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they are dependent on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance. During fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized Legg Mason, at its discretion, to purchase up to 4.5 million shares of its own common stock. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we repurchased 734,700 shares for $40.7 million, 1,183,950 shares for $65.4 million, and 1,327,350 shares for $42.0 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2005, the maximum amount of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is 1,048,800. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid cash dividends of $51.7 million, $35.2 million, and $28.2 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. The Parents broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is designed to measure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. As of March 31, 2005, the broker dealer subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of $388.9 million, which exceeded minimum net capital requirements by $364.6 million. The amount of the broker dealers net assets that may be distributed is subject to restrictions under applicable net capital rules. Net capital for each broker dealer subsidiary exceeded the required net capital. The Parents trust subsidiary is subject to the requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which requires compliance with regulatory capital standards. As of March 31, 2005, the trust subsidiary met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are also subject to the requirements of local regulatory agencies. These subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. 46 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC, include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as under contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Special Purposes Entities under Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, our broker dealer subsidiaries enter into transactions in the normal course of business that expose us to off balance sheet risk, which are described in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments Legg Mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 7, 8 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations at March 31, 2005 (In millions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term borrowings by contract maturity (a) $ 103.0 $ 3.4 $ 286.6 $ 428.7 $ 3.9 $ 2.3 $ 827.9 Coupon interest on long term borrowings 36.0 29.3 29.2 14.7 0.2 109.4 Minimum rental commitments 68.6 57.3 52.5 47.3 33.5 82.8 342.0 Total Contractual Obligations $ 207.6 $ 90.0 $ 368.3 $ 490.7 $ 37.6 $ 85.1 $ 1,279.3 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions (b) 26.3 300.0 326.3 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(c) $ 233.9 $ 390.0 $ 368.3 $ 490.7 $ 37.6 $ 85.1 $ 1,605.6 (a) For this table, included in the payments in 2008 is $283.1, reflecting amounts that may be due to holders of the zero coupon convertible senior notes, which represents the accreted value on the next date that the holders may require us to purchase the notes. Legg Mason has the option to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock or a combination of both. Based upon the current price of our stock, we do not expect there will be any convertible notes tendered for repurchase on June 6, 2005, however, if any notes are tendered, we have elected to pay cash. (b) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (c) The table above does not include approximately $9.2 in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2006 to 2011. These capital commitments also include $0.2 of commitments to lend employees funds to invest in one of these partnerships. 47 Table of Contents Risk Management Risk is an inherent part of our business. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage the various types of risks involved in our activities is critical to our soundness and profitability. The primary risks that we seek to manage are: market, credit, operational, legal and funding. Risk management at Legg Mason is a multi faceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and utilizes specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. We utilize a variety of committees in our risk management framework. The Risk Management Committee (RMC) sets broad based risk policies consistent with the business objectives of Legg Mason. We also have committees that report to the RMC, all of which have representation by senior management of both the relevant business units and the support and control functions within Legg Mason. These committees are intended to provide a thorough review of risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and businesses, and transactions with risk elements. These committees include: Equity and Fixed Income Commitment Committees approve our participation in the underwriting of equity and fixed income securities. Private Client and Capital Markets New Business and Products Committee evaluates and approves proposed new business initiatives, or proposed changes to existing businesses, which may increase the risk profile of the firm. Asset Management Risk Management Committee evaluates and approves proposed new business initiatives, or proposed changes to existing businesses, in our Asset Management segment, which may increase the risk profile of the firm. Credit Committee establishes policies for, and monitors the related risks of, counterparty credit and market risk exposure created through margin lending, equity and fixed income proprietary trading, securities lending, correspondent clearing and institutional sales. In addition, the Credit Committee establishes policies including limits for trading securities owned by the firm that are used to facilitate customer securities transactions. Our risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Because risk management is a continuous process that seeks to manage rather than eliminate risks, no assurance can be given as to the effect on Legg Mason of any risk, or that any or all risks will actually be properly managed. Funding risk is discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, implied volatilities, correlations, or other market factors such as liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We make dealer markets in a variety of debt and equity securities and accordingly hold these securities in our inventory accounts. We also hold security positions in inventory to facilitate customer orders. These holdings subject us to market risk. The majority of our trading securities inventory consists of debt instruments for which we hedge the market risk by holding offsetting positions in other trading securities with similar characteristics or financial instruments such as options or futures. These hedges are designed to reduce, rather than eliminate, the market risk. The equity securities in our trading security inventory primarily result from our acting as a market maker for certain securities traded on NASDAQ, and from executing and clearing large blocks of equity securities for our clients. Virtually our entire trading inventory is denominated in U.S. dollars, therefore foreign exchange risk in this inventory is minimal. We do not deal in, or hold, interest rate or currency swaps or other similar off balance sheet instruments. We generally do not deal in, or hold, commodity futures. Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. We have established a variety of limits, at business unit and trading desk levels, to lessen our exposure to market risk. These limits include aggregate long market value, aggregate short market value, aging, and concentration. Our various business units and trading desks are responsible for managing market risk exposures on an intra day basis and within the limits set by management. Compliance with these limits is also monitored on a daily basis by a support area independent of the business units. Limit exceptions, if any, are communicated to both the applicable business unit and senior management on a daily basis, and to the Credit Committee. The following tables categorize Legg Masons market risk sensitive financial instruments by type of security and maturity date. The Fair Value of Trading Securities below reflects our Trading assets net of our Trading liabilities, excluding those of consolidated variable interest entities. Trading securities in the table below also include the fair value of forward transactions in trading securities (those which settle beyond the normal settlement date), which is consistent with the way we manage our risk exposure. At March 31, 2005, the contract value of forward purchase and sales of trading securities was $3.6 million and $54.6 million, respectively. The value of forward transactions at March 31, 2004 was immaterial. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the related gross long and short fair values of our trading securities. The Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments includes Investment securities, in addition to treasury securities of $80.7 million and $242.2 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, included in Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations. 48 Table of Contents The following table categorizes Legg Masons market risk sensitive financial instruments: Financial Instruments with Market Risk at March 31, 2005 Fiscal Year (In thousands) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fair Value of Trading Securities U.S. Government and agencies $ $ (8,058 ) $ (138 ) $ 1,253 $ (82,126 ) $ 112 $ (88,957 ) Corporate debt 576 542 (316 ) (377 ) 571 69,939 70,935 State and municipal bonds 1,358 654 3,317 2,104 1,585 172,917 181,935 Total debt securities 1,934 (6,862 ) 2,863 2,980 (79,970 ) 242,968 163,913 Equity and other securities (914 ) (914 ) Total trading securities $ 1,934 $ (6,862 ) $ 2,863 $ 2,980 $ (79,970 ) $ 242,054 $ 162,999 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments U.S. Government and agencies $ 80,820 $ $ $ 340 $ $ 2,457 $ 83,617 Corporate debt 498 836 254 412 318 2,318 Total debt securities 81,318 836 254 752 2,775 85,935 Equity and other securities 67,638 67,638 Total other financial instruments $ 81,318 $ 836 $ 254 $ 752 $ $ 70,413 $ 153,573 Total trading and other financial instruments $ 83,252 $ (6,026 ) $ 3,117 $ 3,732 $ (79,970 ) $ 312,467 $ 316,572 Weighted Average Yield U.S. Government and agencies 2.66 % 2.91 % 2.99 % 3.89 % 3.92 % 4.27 % Corporate debt 3.88 6.43 5.24 5.34 5.30 5.10 State and municipal bonds 3.19 4.03 4.21 3.61 3.62 3.29 Financial Instruments with Market Risk at March 31, 2004 Fiscal Year (In thousands) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fair Value of Trading Securities U.S. Government and agencies $ (25 ) $ (15,918 ) $ 7,291 $ 4,727 $ (22,386 ) $ 33,775 $ 7,464 Corporate debt 136 9 228 (7,861 ) 2,833 6,338 1,683 State and municipal bonds 5,614 4,244 737 4,435 1,647 108,521 125,198 Total debt securities 5,725 (11,665 ) 8,256 1,301 (17,906 ) 148,634 134,345 Equity and other securities 7,308 7,308 Total trading securities $ 5,725 $ (11,665 ) $ 8,256 $ 1,301 $ (17,906 ) $ 155,942 $ 141,653 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments U.S. Government and agencies $ 242,185 $ $ $ $ 480 $ 2,714 $ 245,379 Corporate debt 1,550 742 1,593 389 4,274 Total debt securities 243,735 742 1,593 389 480 2,714 249,653 Equity and other securities 30,807 30,807 Total other financial instruments $ 243,735 $ 742 $ 1,593 $ 389 $ 480 $ 33,521 $ 280,460 Total trading and other financial instruments $ 249,460 $ (10,923 ) $ 9,849 $ 1,690 $ (17,426 ) $ 189,463 $ 422,113 Weighted Average Yield U.S. Government and agencies 4.08 % 1.09 % 2.30 % 1.67 % 2.16 % 4.15 % Corporate debt 1.89 5.62 3.53 3.90 4.45 5.01 State and municipal bonds 4.45 3.05 3.63 3.54 2.80 3.79 49 Table of Contents In addition to the financial instruments included in the table, we have four long term debt facilities, which are described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.

These fluctuations are recorded as a component of Stockholders Equity and are not material to our financial condition. The impact of currency fluctuations during the year on our results of operations was not material. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client, counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by Legg Mason fails to perform its contractual obligations to us. We follow industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral. Credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which are monitored daily. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform sensitivity analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. Operational Risk Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from operating activities, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes. We operate different businesses in diverse markets and we are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process high volumes of transactions often within limited time frames. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, we have procedures requiring that all securities transactions must be confirmed on a timely basis, that position valuations be subject to periodic independent review procedures and that collateral and adequate documentation are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances. We conduct periodic self assessments, internal audits and compliance department examinations to assess the design and operational effectiveness of internal controls. Disaster recovery plans exist for our critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. We believe that our disaster recovery program, including off site back up technology and operational facilities, is adequate to handle a reasonable business disruption. However, there can be no assurances that a disaster directly affecting our headquarters or our operations centers would not have a material adverse impact. Insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses. Legal Risk Legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have various procedures addressing some of these issues, such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, protection of client information, collection activities, money laundering and record keeping. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing organizations, Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Trading assets, Investment securities and Trading liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. 50 Table of Contents For Trading assets and Trading liabilities, we value equity securities using prices from independent sources such as external pricing services, broker or dealer price quotations, and closing market prices for listed instruments, when available. Fixed income securities are valued using external pricing services, third party broker or dealer price quotations, or traders estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. Traders estimates are compared to external pricing services to verify that there are no material variations, either individually or in the aggregate, and further verified through comparison to actual values realized. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the restricted security is based primarily on the price of the same security without restriction, but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. In addition, even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote, certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value. We generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if sold, and that any such sale would occur in an orderly manner. However, these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value received upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for other than temporary impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities based upon available information. As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, we owned approximately $5.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of non trading financial instruments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates. At March 31, 2005 and 2004, we also have approximately $33.2 million and $26.2 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, it provides that the cost of an acquired entity must be allocated to the assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at date of acquisition. The excess cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired must be recognized as goodwill. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, provides that goodwill is not amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset must be amortized over its useful life, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds and trade names. Management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost above identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired, primarily asset management contracts, proprietary mutual fund management contracts and trade names, based upon certain estimates and assumptions including as to projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed. As of March 31, 2005, we had $993.4 million in goodwill, $160.1 million in indefinite life intangible assets and $296.0 million in amortizable intangible assets. Generally, the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets range from 5 to 20 years. Goodwill is evaluated quarterly at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment, and is deemed to be impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows and multiples of revenues, similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Substantially all of our goodwill is assigned to the Asset Management operating segment. We have defined the Asset Management reporting units to be the Institutional, Mutual Funds, and Wealth Management divisions. 51 Table of Contents Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of goodwill under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, the growth rate used in projecting the cash flows, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized fiscal year to date cash flows for the reporting unit and are projected forward forty years. Annual cash flow growth rates are based on historical growth rates realized by the reporting unit. The Wealth Management reporting unit represents approximately 80% of our goodwill. Wealth Managements cash flows are assumed to grow 10% annually over the next five years, with a long term annual growth rate of 5%. The projected cash flows are discounted at 16% to determine the present value. Annual cash flows would have to fall by over 50%, the discount rate increased to over 25%, or cash flow growth would have to fall to zero percent for the asset to be deemed impaired. We review the fair value of our intangible assets on a quarterly basis, considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue multiples, to determine whether the value of the assets is impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value assessed. The fair values of intangible assets subject to amortization are determined at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of management contract intangible assets include the projected cash flows generated by the contracts, the attrition rate of the contracts and the remaining life of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current assets under management levels for the applicable contracts. Contracts are assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The expected life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. The management contract intangible asset related to PCM represents approximately 80% of our total amortizable intangible assets. The contracts have an expected life of 18 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 6%), with an expected remaining life of 14 years at March 31, 2005. At current expected client attrition rates, the cash flows generated by the underlying management contracts held by PCM would have to decline by approximately 70% for the asset to become impaired. Similarly, with no change to the profitability of the contracts, client attrition would have to accelerate to a rate such that our estimated useful life would decline by approximately 75% before the asset would be deemed to be impaired. For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary mutual fund contracts and trade names. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of indefinite life intangible assets related to proprietary mutual fund contracts include the projected cash flows generated by those contracts and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized fiscal year to date cash flows for the applicable contracts and are projected forward twenty years, assuming annual cash flow growth approximating market returns. Contracts within the same family of funds are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can freely exchange between funds. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund family are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Royce represents approximately 95% of our proprietary mutual fund contract intangible assets. Cash flows from these mutual fund contracts are assumed to grow 10% annually, which approximates the long term average annual return of the Russell 20004 Index. The projected cash flows are discounted at 14% to determine the present value. Significant changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in an impairment. At current profitability levels, cash flows generated by the Royce mutual funds contracts would have to fall approximately 85% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised to over 50% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of indefinite life intangible assets related to trade names include the projected cash flows generated by the applicable entities, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows, and the royalty fee rate. Projected cash flows are based on implied royalty fees determined by applying a 3% royalty rate to the annualized fiscal year to date revenues for the applicable entities, projected forward in perpetuity. PCM represents approximately 85% of our trade name indefinite life intangible assets. PCMs revenues are assumed to grow 10% annually, which approximates the long term average annual return of the Russell 20004 Index. The projected cash flows are discounted at 16% to determine the present value of the cash flows. If the revenue growth rate assumption were reduced to less than 3%, the discount rate increased to over 20% or the royalty rate lowered to approximately 1%, the asset would be deemed impaired. 4 Russell 2000 Index is a trademark of the Frank Russell Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason. 52 Table of Contents Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM and Royce, involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Generally, contingent payments are recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Liabilities for Losses and Contingencies Legg Mason is the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities, including certain class actions, which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages, which could be substantial. Legg Mason has also been involved in governmental and self regulatory agency investigations and proceedings. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, we have established liabilities for potential losses from such complaints, legal actions, investigations and proceedings. In establishing these liabilities, we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses have been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses. In making these decisions, we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations, consultations with legal counsel and our historical experience in resolving similar matters. In many lawsuits, arbitrations and regulatory proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. However, accruals are reviewed monthly and are adjusted to reflect our estimates of the impact of developments, rulings, advice of counsel and any other information pertinent to a particular matter. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory actions, we cannot predict with certainty the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters. If our judgments prove to be incorrect, our liability for losses and contingencies may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions, which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined. As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, our liability for losses and contingencies was $27.0 million and $31.8 million, respectively. The most significant component of the liability balance for both periods reflects an approximate $20.0 million verdict rendered in October 2003, which was confirmed in a subsequent judgment, for a copyright infringement lawsuit that is being appealed. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation and retention bonuses payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue stock options to officers, key employees and non employee members of our Board of Directors. Prior to April 1, 2003, we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended. In accordance with APB No. 25, prior to fiscal 2004, compensation expense was not recognized for stock options because they had no intrinsic value on the date of grant, since the exercise price of the options was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock. During fiscal 2004, we adopted the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, prospectively for all stock options granted and stock purchase plan transactions after April 1, 2003, using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Under the prospective method allowed under SFAS No. 148, compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of stock options granted after April 1, 2003 over the applicable vesting period. No compensation expense is recognized for stock options granted prior to April 1, 2003. Therefore, the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for March 31, 2005 is less than that which would have been included if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 148, we provide disclosure in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the pro forma results under the modified prospective fair value based method, as if compensation expense associated with all stock option grants had been recognized over their respective vesting period. If we accounted for prior years stock option grants under the modified prospective fair value based method, net earnings would have been reduced by $14.0 million, $17.3 million and $22.7 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reduction in these amounts is a result of a decrease in the number of stock options granted and the impact of the inclusion of additional years of expense in the actual results of operations since the adoption in fiscal 2004. We granted 574,035, 914,475 and 2,243,835 stock options in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price 53 Table of Contents on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility based upon the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes model, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants may be different. In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123 (SFAS No. 123R) requiring companies to record share based payment transactions as compensation expense at fair market value under either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method. In April 2004, the SEC delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 123R until our fiscal 2007. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. We also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be recovered then we must establish a valuation allowance and increase our deferred tax provision. We recorded a valuation allowance of $23.0 million and $25.3 million as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards and non U.S. net operating and capital loss carryforwards, since it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we determine that our estimates have changed, the income tax provision will be adjusted in the period in which that determination is made. Forward Looking Statements Information or statements provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason from time to time, including those within this 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K, may contain certain forward looking information, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of client assets under management, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. We caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to those discussed below, those discussed under the heading Factors Affecting the Company and the Financial Services Industry and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of assets under management; the volume of trading in securities; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; the level of margin and customer account balances; competitive conditions in each of our business segments; the demand for investment banking services; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of net revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. 54 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation Based on todays low inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, securities and receivables, we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation. The rate of inflation, however, can affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Recent Accounting Developments The FASB has issued the following pronouncements during fiscal 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires all share based payment transactions to be valued using the fair value method. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25. Originally, SFAS 123R was effective for all interim periods beginning after June 15, 2005, but in April 2005 the SEC amended the date for compliance by allowing the effective date to be the annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, SFAS 123R is effective for fiscal 2007. See table in Stock Based Compensation of Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the potential impact on Legg Masons Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act, which was signed into law on October 22, 2004, provides for a one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to U.S. taxpayers. Historically, Legg Mason has reinvested cumulative undistributed earnings of its non U.S. subsidiaries and, accordingly, deferred U.S. federal income taxes on such undistributed earnings were not recorded. Legg Mason is currently evaluating the income tax effects of the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the Act and cannot reasonably estimate the income tax effects, if any, at this time. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus regarding Issue 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share. The guidance in this EITF requires contingently convertible instruments, if dilutive, to be included retroactively in diluted earnings per share computations from the date of issuance of the instruments. The effective date of this EITF is for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. As a result of the adoption of this EITF, our contingently convertible senior notes are now included in our diluted earnings per share computation for fiscal 2004 and 2003, which has resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of $0.06 and $0.07, respectively, for these periods. The EITF reached a consensus on Topic No. D 108, Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other Than Goodwill. Companies who have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing should perform an impairment test applying this guidance by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2004. Impairments of intangible assets recognized upon application of a direct value method by entities previously applying the residual method should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. These requirements should be applied to business combinations completed after September 29, 2004. The adoption of EITF D 108 did not impact Legg Masons Consolidated Financial Statements. The EITF reached a consensus on Issue 04 10, Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds. This EITF requires that individual operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds set forth in SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, for separate reporting may be aggregated only if the segments meet certain requirements. These requirements are applicable for fiscal years ending after October 13, 2004. The adoption of EITF 04 10 did not impact Legg Masons identified segments. The EITF reached a consensus on Issue 03 16, Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies. This EITF requires that an investment in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) that maintains a specific ownership account for each investor similar to a partnership capital account structure should be viewed as similar to an investment in a limited partnership for purposes of determining whether a non controlling investment in an LLC should be accounted for using the cost method or the equity method. These requirements are applicable for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 16 did not materially impact Legg Masons Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A.
