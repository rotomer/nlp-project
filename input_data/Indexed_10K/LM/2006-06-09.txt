ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise Legg Mason) is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom but also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Dubai, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. On December 1, 2005, we completed a strategic acquisition to become a pure asset management company in which we transferred our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses (PC/CM) to Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) as a portion of the consideration in exchange for substantially all of Citigroups asset management business (CAM). Prior to the closing of this transaction, we reported the PC/CM businesses as separate operating segments; however, both businesses are now included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Effective November 1, 2005, we also purchased Permal Group Ltd (Permal), a leading global funds of hedge funds manager, to expand our global asset management business. Following the consummation of the CAM and Permal acquisitions and the sale of the PC/CM businesses, we are in the process of reorganizing and assimilating the acquired businesses. Upon the substantial completion of these integration and organizational undertakings, we will assess the appropriate managerial and reporting structures for our business. Until such time, we are managing our continuing operations as a comprehensive Asset Management business with three divisions: Mutual Funds/ Managed Services, Institutional and Wealth Management. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction with Citigroup and the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the sale of our PC/CM businesses to Citigroup, the portion of parent company interest income and expense and general corporate overhead costs that was previously allocated to these businesses is now included in our continuing operations. In addition, distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in continuing operations as distribution fee revenue, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties, including parties that were related prior to the sale, as distribution and servicing expense. All periods presented have been restated to reflect these changes. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees from separate accounts and funds and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, the ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. The rates that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Rates charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than rates charged for fixed income asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which 36 Table of Contents are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. A majority of our distribution and service fee revenue is passed through to third parties as a distribution and servicing expense. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous national, regional and local asset management firms and broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been affected by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes in the post Enron era. In addition, the financial services industry has been the subject of a number of regulatory proceedings and requirements over the last few years, including proceedings regarding a number of mutual funds sales practices. The Sarbanes Oxley Act continues to require us to implement new policies or review existing policies with respect to corporate governance, auditor independence and internal controls over financial reporting. This had a significant impact for fiscal 2006 as a result of the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. Responding to these changes has required us to add employees and incur costs that have impacted our profitability. Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of the PC/CM businesses, the Private Client and Capital Markets segments are reflected in discontinued operations. Private Client distributed a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client were commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fee based account fees and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment were reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. Capital Markets consisted of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance investment banking. The primary sources of revenue for equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading included commissions and principal credits on transactions in both corporate and municipal products. We maintained proprietary fixed income and equity securities inventory primarily to facilitate customer transactions and as a result recognized trading profits and losses from our proprietary trading activities. 37 Table of Contents Investment banking revenues included underwriting fees and advisory fees from private placements and mergers and acquisitions. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings were reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also included realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities. All references to fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as we, us, our, and company refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The financial environment in the United States during fiscal 2006 was mixed and, despite investor concerns about rising interest rates, record high fuel prices and hurricane damage to the Gulf Coast region, all three major market indexes showed strong returns for the fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average1, Nasdaq Composite Index2 and the S&P 5003 were up 6%, 17% and 10%, respectively, for the fiscal year. During fiscal 2006, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate eight times to bring the federal funds rate to 4.75%, up from 2.75% at the end of fiscal 2005. The financial services industry continues to be impacted by legislative and regulatory changes. Participants in the industry have responded and reacted to numerous regulatory investigations and inquiries, proposals and adoptions of new regulations and revised and enhanced interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Regulatory investigations into mutual fund trading practices within the financial services industry have uncovered instances of conflicts of interest and insufficient internal controls related to mutual funds and have resulted in a negative public perception of the mutual fund industry, numerous regulatory proposals, a strict regulatory environment and significant fines and penalties against, and fee reductions by, a number of financial services companies.

Effective November 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the acquisitions, the results of our continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 include five months of results from Permal and four months of results from CAM. Operating revenues increased 68% to $2.6 billion as a result of higher revenues from significantly increased levels of assets under management primarily from the CAM and Permal acquisitions. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended March 31, 2006 also increased significantly compared to the prior year. Net income increased to $1.1 billion from $408.4 million, or 180%, and diluted earnings per share increased to $8.80 from $3.53, up 149%, in part due to a net gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $644.0 million, or $4.94 per share. Income from continuing operations totaled $433.7 million, up 47% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. Higher levels of assets under management at Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset) and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. (LMCM) also contributed to the increase. The operating income margin was 26%, down from 31% in the prior year. The income from continuing operations before income tax margin was 27%, down from 30% in fiscal 2005. The decreases in the margins were primarily due to a significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense, and to transaction related compensation costs related to the CAM acquisition. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.35, an increase of 31% from $2.56. Weighted average diluted shares increased 11% to 130.3 million due primarily to the issuance of common and non voting convertible preferred shares in connection with the acquisition of CAM. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $66.4 million, down 41% from the prior year primarily due to the sale of the PC/CM businesses on December 1, 2005. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51, a decrease of 47% from $0.97 for the prior year. All share and earnings per share numbers have been restated for fiscal 2005 and 2004, where appropriate, for a 3 for 2 stock split effective September 24, 2004. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2006 2005 Beginning of period $ 374.5 $ 286.2 Net client cash flows 35.6 65.3 Market appreciation, net 36.9 16.8 Acquisitions (dispositions), net 420.6 6.2 End of period $ 867.6 $ 374.5 Assets under management at March 31, 2006 were $867.6 billion, up $493.1 billion or 132% from March 31, 2005. The acquisitions of CAM and Permal were responsible for approximately $426.1 billion or 86% of the net increase, with market performance, including currency translation, $36.9 billion or 8% of the increase and net client cash flows responsible for $35.6 billion or 7%. Our Institutional Asset Management division represented 51% of total assets managed at year end, our Mutual Funds/ Managed Services division represented 41% and our Wealth Management division represented 8%. Non US domiciled clients accounted for 30% of total assets under management, which compares with 24% of non US client assets at March 31, 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of non US assets managed by CAM and Permal. 40 Table of Contents Our assets under management by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2006 2005 Mutual Funds/Managed Services $ 356.5 $ 77.9 Institutional 444.8 247.6 Wealth Management 66.3 49.0 Total $ 867.6 $ 374.5 Fiscal 2005 has been restated to include certain previously excluded client assets, principally assets subadvised by unaffiliated parties and certain non discretionary accounts. As a result, reported assets under management of our legacy advisers increased by $1.6 billion at March 31, 2005. CAMs fixed income and international equity separate accounts are included in our Institutional division, while its US equity separate accounts and all mutual and other proprietary fund assets under management are included in our Mutual Funds/Managed Services division. Permals assets under management are included in our Wealth Management division. Assets under management by type (in billions) as of March 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 2006 % of Total 2005 % of Total % Change Equity $ 324.9 37.5 $ 144.7 38.6 124.5 Fixed Income 394.2 45.4 208.4 55.7 89.2 Liquidity 148.5 17.1 21.4 5.7 593.9 Total $ 867.6 100.0 $ 374.5 100.0 131.7 The following discussion separately addresses the results of continuing operations and the results of our discontinued operations. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2006 were $2.6 billion, up 68% from $1.6 billion in the prior year as a result of growth in assets under management. The CAM and Permal acquisitions accounted for 70% of the increase in revenues. Strong growth in aggregate assets under management experienced by Western Asset and LMCM also contributed to the increase. Performance fees rose $52.7 million to $101.6 million during fiscal 2006, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Permal. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts, including performance fees, increased 40% to $1.2 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisition of CAM and growth in assets managed at Western Asset. CAM and Western Asset accounted for 41% and 27% of the increase, respectively. Collectively, LMCM, Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC (Brandywine) and Private Capital Management, L.P. (PCM) accounted for 23% of the increased investment advisory fees from separate accounts. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 127% to $1.0 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. CAM and Permal accounted for 84% of the increase in investment advisory fees from funds. Increases in fund assets managed by Royce and Associates, LLC (Royce) and LMCM accounted for 10% of the increase. Distribution and service fees increased 63% to $425.6 million, with $120.5 million, or 73% of the increase, due to the addition of CAMs distribution and service fees. Other operating revenues decreased by 18% to $22.6 million, primarily as a result of declines in commissions earned by PCMs related broker dealer. 41 Table of Contents Our operating revenues by Asset Management division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2006 2005 Mutual Funds/Managed Services $ 1,330.0 $ 724.0 Institutional 747.0 515.4 Wealth Management 568.2 331.3 Total $ 2,645.2 $ 1,570.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Mutual Funds/ Managed Services and Institutional divisions was primarily due to the acquisition of CAM. The increase in the operating revenues of the Wealth Management division is primarily due to the inclusion of Permals revenues. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 70% to $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of the addition of transaction related compensation costs from the acquired businesses, including compensation related to the CAM acquisition, and increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our other subsidiaries. Transaction related compensation costs primarily include recognition of previously deferred compensation for CAM employees under prior Citigroup plans and accruals for retention compensation for transitional CAM employees. Costs for severance at CAM are included in the purchase price allocation and are not reflected in our results of operations. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 42.6% for the year ended March 31, 2006, up from 42.1%, resulting from the transaction related compensation discussed above, offset in part by the significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 122% to $561.8 million, primarily as a result of the addition of $183.4 million in distribution and service fee expense at CAM. Permal also contributed to the increase. Communications and technology expense increased 93% to $89.2 million, primarily as a result of the addition of CAMs expenses, such as market data, consulting fees, technology depreciation and amortization. Occupancy increased 85% to $50.9 million, primarily due to the impact of the CAM and Permal acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets increased 81% to $38.5 million from $21.3 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the CAM acquisition. The litigation award settlement reflects the reversal of $8.2 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2004 as a result of the settlement of a civil copyright infringement lawsuit in the current period. Other expenses increased 49% to $106.0 million, primarily due to increased promotional costs at CAM and professional fees. In connection with the acquisition of CAM and sale of the PC/CM businesses, Legg Mason and Citigroup entered into mutual transition services agreements to provide certain administrative services (other than investment advisory services) provided by the seller to the transferred business in the ordinary course prior to the date of sale. Under each agreement, the respective services are to be provided for up to eighteen months with a provision for an additional six month renewal. The service recipient may terminate the services on an individual basis with notice. For the four months ended March 31, 2006, Other expenses include approximately $14.9 million of costs for services provided to the CAM operations by Citigroup and $16.8 million of expense reductions for cost of services provided to Citigroup for support of sold businesses. 42 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $27.9 million to $48.0 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates on higher average firm investment account balances. Interest expense increased $7.9 million to $52.6 million due to additional debt incurred in connection with the CAM acquisition, offset in part by the conversion of $479.9 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes to common stock. Other income increased $34.0 million to $40.4 million as a result of net gains on firm investments and gains from trading investments held by consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) as a result of the Permal acquisition, which are offset in part by a corresponding minority interests allocation. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased 57% to $275.6 million, primarily as a result of the increase in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate increased to 38.5% from 37.2% in the prior years period primarily due to a higher provision for state income taxes as a result of the acquisitions of CAM and Permal, which operate in state and local jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Supplemental Financial Information Cash income from continuing operations rose 46% for the fiscal year to $527.1 million or $4.06 per diluted share from $361.7 million or $3.13 per diluted share, primarily from the increase in income from continuing operations due to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for cash income from continuing operations. Management uses cash income from continuing operations as a benchmark in evaluating the operating performance of the company and its subsidiaries. We define cash income from continuing operations as income from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and stock based compensation costs. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Legg Mason considers cash income from continuing operations to be a useful representation of its operating performance because it represents Legg Masons income from continuing operations adjusted for certain non cash items. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the after tax impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense does not represent an actual decline in the value of the intangible assets. Deferred taxes on intangible assets, including goodwill, represent the actual tax benefits that are not expected to be realized for GAAP purposes. Since these deferred tax assets are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business, we add them to income from continuing operations in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Stock based compensation costs are non cash expenses and therefore are also added to income from continuing operations to calculate cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges represent a decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. For the calculation of diluted cash income per share from continuing operations, the divisor is the number of total weighted average diluted common shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. 43 Table of Contents A reconciliation of Income from continuing operations to Cash income from continuing operations is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, Period toPeriod Change 2006 2005 Income from Continuing Operations $ 433,707 $ 295,424 46.8 % Plus: Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax 23,646 13,358 77.0 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 59,940 50,291 19.2 Stock based compensation, net of tax(1) 9,829 2,652 270.6 Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 527,122 $ 361,725 45.7 Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 3.35 $ 2.56 30.9 Amortization of intangible assets 0.18 0.12 50.0 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.46 0.43 7.0 Stock based compensation 0.07 0.02 250.0 Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 4.06 $ 3.13 29.7 (1) Stock based compensation can generate tax benefits from market appreciation in excess of the related amounts expensed for financial statement purposes. Because these benefits are derived from the market appreciation of our stock, we believe they would inappropriately inflate cash income and therefore are excluded from the calculation. RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Since the announcement of the transaction to sell the PC/CM businesses in June 2005, these businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction with Citigroup. Prior to the sale on December 1, 2005, PC/CM were operating segments. Due to the sale of the PC/CM businesses on December 1, 2005, the current fiscal year reflects results for eight months compared to twelve months in the prior years period. The results for fiscal 2006 were also negatively affected by the announcement of the transaction. As a result, net revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2006 decreased $310.7 million, or 36%, to $545.7 million. Income from discontinued operations before income tax decreased $78.5 million, or 42%. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51, a decrease of 47% from $0.97 in the prior year. Financial results of discontinued operations by business segment were as follows: 2006 2005 NET REVENUES: Private Client $ 502,400 $ 727,888 Capital Markets 168,751 306,653 671,151 1,034,541 Reclassification(1) (125,436 ) (178,175 ) Total $ 545,715 $ 856,366 INCOME BEFOREINCOME TAX PROVISION: Private Client $ 100,289 $ 132,785 Capital Markets 9,115 55,164 Total $ 109,404 $ 187,949 (1) Represents distribution fees from proprietary mutual funds, historically reported in Private Client, that have been reclassified to Asset Management as distribution fee revenue, with a corresponding distribution expense, to reflect Legg Masons continuing role as funds distributor. 44 Table of Contents FISCAL 2005 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2004 Financial Overview Revenues increased 36% to $1.6 billion, primarily as a result of higher revenues from significantly increased levels of assets under management. Net income increased 37% to $408.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $3.53, up 33%. Income from continuing operations increased 58% to $295.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.56, up 52%. The operating income margin was 31%, up from 28% in the prior year period. The income from continuing operations before income tax margin increased to 30% from 26%. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $113.0 million, up 9% from the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.97, an increase of 7% from $0.91. Our earnings per share in fiscal 2005 included the weighted impact of 4.6 million shares that were issued in an underwritten offering of our common stock in December 2004, for net proceeds of approximately $311 million. Included in fiscal 2004 is a single litigation award charge of $19.0 million resulting from a jury verdict and subsequent judgment in a civil copyright infringement lawsuit. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2005 2004 Beginning of period $ 286.2 $ 192.2 Net client cash flows 65.3 48.0 Market appreciation, net 16.8 45.0 Acquisitions (dispositions), net 6.2 1.0 End of period $ 374.5 $ 286.2 Assets under management at March 31, 2005 were $374.5 billion, up $88.3 billion or 31% from March 31, 2004. Net client cash flows were primarily responsible for just under 75% of the increase, with market performance, including currency translation, accounting for 20% and the December 31, 2004 acquisition of four offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel responsible for the remainder. The strong increase in assets under management at Western Asset, our principal fixed income manager, was the primary driver in our equity assets declining as a percentage of our total managed assets, from 39% a year ago to 38% at March 31, 2005. Our Institutional asset management division represented 66% of total managed assets at year end, our Mutual Funds division represented 21% and our Wealth Management division represented 13%. Our assets under management by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2005 2004 Mutual Funds/Managed Services $ 77.9 $ 64.3 Institutional 247.6 186.8 Wealth Management 49.0 35.1 Total $ 374.5 $ 286.2 March 31, 2005 has been restated to include certain previously excluded client assets, principally assets subadvised by unaffiliated parties and certain non discretionary accounts. As a result, reported assets under management of our legacy advisers increased by $1.6 billion at March 31, 2005. The increase in assets under management in the Mutual Funds/Managed Services division was due primarily to growth in assets managed at LMCM and Royce. The strong growth in assets under management at Western Asset accounted for 80% of the increase in the Institutional division. PCM accounted for the majority of the increase in assets under management in the Wealth Management division. The acquisition of four offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel during fiscal 2005 also contributed to the increase in assets under management in the Wealth Management division. Legg Mason Investments Holdings Limited 45 Table of Contents (LMIH) was moved from the Institutional division to the Mutual Fund/Managed Services division during fiscal 2005 to reflect the change in focus of their business from managing assets to distributing investment funds. This change had no material impact on assets under management presented above. Assets under management by type (in billions) as of March 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2005 % of Total 2004 % of Total %Change Equity $ 144.7 38.6 $ 112.2 39.2 29.0 Fixed Income 208.4 55.7 158.2 55.3 31.7 Liquidity 21.4 5.7 15.8 5.5 35.4 Total $ 374.5 100.0 $ 286.2 100.0 30.9 RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2005 were $1.6 billion, up 36% from $1.2 billion in the prior year as a result of growth in assets under management, primarily resulting from PCM, Western Asset and Royce. Assets under management increased 31% to $374.5 billion. Performance fees rose slightly to $48.9 million during fiscal 2005. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts, including performance fees, increased 39% to $821.0 million, primarily as a result of growth in assets under management. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the growth of assets under management at PCM and Western, which accounted for 69% of the increase. LMCM, Brandywine and Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. also accounted for 28% of the increase. Performance fees rose $7.4 million to $48.9 million during fiscal 2005. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 40% to $460.6 million, primarily as a result of growth in assets managed at Royce. Increased assets managed by LMCM and Western Asset also contributed to the increase. Distribution and service fees increased 27% to $261.6 million, primarily due to increases in distribution fees from proprietary mutual funds of $30.5 million to $196.6 million for fiscal 2005. These fees are reported in continuing operations to reflect our continuing role as funds distributor, with a corresponding distribution expense. Also contributing to the overall increase was the impact of increased sales and subsequent growth of Royce and offshore funds. Other operating revenues increased by 11% to $27.5 million, primarily as a result of increases in commissions earned by PCMs related broker dealer. Our operating revenues by Asset Management division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2005 2004 Mutual Funds/Managed Services $ 724.0 $ 500.1 Institutional 515.4 424.8 Wealth Management 331.3 228.2 Total $ 1,570.7 $ 1,153.1 The increase in operating revenues for the Mutual Fund/ Managed Services division was primarily due to increased assets under management at Royce, which accounted for 41% of the increase. For fiscal 2005, LMIH was moved from the Institutional division to the Mutual Fund/ Managed Services division to reflect the change in focus of their business from managing assets to distributing investment funds. This transfer of LMIH accounted for 31% of the increase in operating revenues in the Mutual Fund/Managed Services division. The increase in the Institutional division was primarily the result of increased assets managed by Western Asset, offset in part by the transfer of LMIH to the Mutual 46 Table of Contents Fund/Managed Services division during fiscal 2005. The increase in the Wealth Management divisions operating revenues was primarily due to a significant increase in revenues at PCM. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 39% to $661.8 million, primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation resulting from increased revenues at subsidiaries operating under revenue sharing agreements. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.1% for fiscal year 2005 from 41.4% for fiscal 2004, primarily due to changes in the percentages of certain revenue sharing arrangements that resulted in a net increase in compensation during fiscal 2005. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 30% to $253.4 million, as a result of an increase in distribution fees on proprietary mutual funds and distribution fees paid to third party distributors on increased sales and subsequent growth of offshore and Royce funds. Communications and technology expense increased 32% to $46.3 million, primarily as a result of higher technology equipment depreciation, consulting costs and market data. The relocation of Western Asset to a new office facility was a significant contributor to the increase in technology equipment depreciation and consulting costs. Occupancy increased 15% to $27.5 million, primarily as a result of increased rent and operating expenses related to Western Assets relocation. Amortization of intangible assets increased 4% to $21.3 million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of four wealth management offices of Scudder Private Investment Counsel in December 2004. In fiscal 2004, we recorded a litigation charge of $19.0 million as a result of a jury verdict and subsequent judgment in a copyright infringement lawsuit (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Other expenses increased 28% to $71.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in professional fees, principally auditing and consulting fees as a result of additional legislative and regulatory requirements, and higher promotional costs. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $5.8 million to $20.1 million, primarily as a result of substantially higher interest rates earned on firm investments. Interest expense of $44.8 million remained relatively unchanged from the prior year. Other income increased to $6.3 million, primarily as a result of unrealized gains on firm investments. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased 54% to $175.3 million, primarily as a result of the increase in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate declined to 37.2% from 37.9% in the prior years period due to a lower provision for income tax uncertainties in fiscal 2005. RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations net revenues increased 6% to $1,034.5 million from $975.9 million in the prior year and pre tax earnings increased 9% to $187.9 million from $171.6 million. Net revenues excludes the reclassification of $178.1 million and $148.5 million for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, of distribution fees from proprietary mutual funds to continuing operations to reflect our continuing role as funds distributor. Private Client Private Client net revenues increased 9% to $727.9 million from $670.3 million in the prior year and pre tax earnings increased 14% to $132.8 million. Investment advisory and related fees increased $55.5 million, principally as a result of increases in distribution fees on company sponsored mutual funds and fees earned from fee based brokerage accounts. Commissions increased $5.1 million as increased sales of non affiliated mutual funds and the impact of a $7.4 million reduction in mutual fund commissions for breakpoint reimbursements to clients in fiscal 2004 were partially offset by lower listed commissions. Investment banking revenues decreased $21.0 million due to a decline in 47 Table of Contents retail corporate selling concessions. Net interest profit in Private Client rose 21% to $57.2 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned on segregated customer and margin account balances and higher levels of customer margin account balances, partially offset by an increase in interest rates paid on customer credit account balances. Compensation and benefits expense increased $27.9 million, primarily due to increased commissions paid on higher distribution fees from company sponsored mutual funds and fee based brokerage revenues, offset in part by a decline in commissions on corporate selling concessions. Other expenses increased $13.9 million, primarily as a result of an increase in allocated overhead costs. Capital Markets Capital Markets net revenues increased 5% to $306.6 million from $291.0 million in the prior year and pre tax earnings increased 3% to $55.1 million. Commissions increased $7.6 million, primarily as a result of increased institutional equity transaction volume. Principal transactions decreased $5.7 million, primarily due to a decline in both institutional taxable and municipal fixed income trading volume. Investment banking revenues increased $8.2 million, primarily as a result of higher corporate advisory and underwriting fees and higher municipal advisory fees, partially offset by a decline in corporate banking management fees. Other revenue increased $6.3 million, primarily due to increased values of firm investments. Compensation and benefits expense increased $4.4 million, primarily as a result of an increase in fixed salaries and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in taxable fixed income commissions and the impact of deferring a portion of commission payouts under a new restricted stock program. Other expenses increased $9.8 million, primarily due to an increase in management fees related to our international equity sales offices and an increase in data communication costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support Legg Masons business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. Liquidity and the access to liquidity are important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. The acquisitions of CAM and Permal during fiscal 2006 demonstrate our efforts to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of CAM in exchange for (i) all outstanding stock of Legg Mason subsidiaries that constitute our PC/CM businesses; (ii) 5,393,545 shares of common stock and 13.346632 shares of non voting Legg Mason convertible preferred stock, which is convertible, upon transfer, into 13,346,632 shares of common stock; and (iii) $512 million in cash borrowed under a $700 million five year syndicated term loan facility. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties agreed to a post closing purchase price adjustment that may increase the price to be paid by us up to $300 million based on the retention of certain assets under management nine months after the closing. We expect to pay any additional amounts by borrowing under a $300 million five year credit agreement. In connection with the sale, we reflected the assets and liabilities of our PC/CM businesses as Assets and Liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2005. 48 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the credit facilities that were executed in connection with the CAM acquisition. The credit facilities include agreements to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The new facilities have restrictive covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain specific leverage ratios. We have maintained compliance with the applicable covenants of these borrowing facilities.

Floating rate linked to Bank of Chile offering rate. (2) This facility replaced our previous $100 million revolving credit facility. On October 14, 2005, Legg Mason entered into a syndicated five year $700 million unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. At closing, we borrowed $600 million, of which $512 million was used to fund the cash portion of the purchase and the remainder was used to fund acquisition related expenses. The remaining $100 million of the $700 million loan facility was drawn down in February 2006 for additional acquisition related costs and the entire $700 million remains outstanding as of March 31, 2006. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a three year amortizing interest rate swap for $400 million of the $700 million term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. Also in connection with the Citigroup transaction, one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under a 364 day promissory note of $83.2 million, and another subsidiary entered into a $16.0 million, 3 year term loan. We funded the payment of approximately $445 million in taxes related to the gain on the sale of PC/CM from existing cash. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We have the right to purchase the preference shares over the next four years and, if that right is not exercised, the holders of those equity interests have the right to require Legg Mason to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The aggregate consideration paid by Legg Mason at closing was $800 million, of which $200 million was in the form of 1,889,322 newly issued shares of Legg Mason common stock and the remainder was cash. We funded the cash portion of the acquisition from existing cash. It is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining 20% ownership interest in Permal, and we will do so in purchases that will be made two and four years after the initial closing at prices based on Permals revenues. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, with a $961 million minimum price, excluding acquisition costs. We may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock. In addition, we will pay a minimum of $39 million in dividends on the preference shares over 4 years. Our assets from continuing operations consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents and investment advisory and related fees receivables. 49 Table of Contents Our assets are principally funded by equity capital and long term debt. The significant increase in intangible assets and goodwill during fiscal 2006 resulted from the CAM and Permal acquisitions. The investment advisory fee receivables are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds, commercial paper or securities purchased under agreements to resell. The highly liquid nature of our current assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. At March 31, 2006, our total assets and stockholders equity were $9.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. During fiscal 2006, stockholders equity increased approximately $3.6 billion primarily due to the issuance of shares in connection with the CAM and Permal acquisitions and the net income for the year. During the year ended March 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents increased by $228.3 million from $795.1 million at March 31, 2005 to $1.02 billion at March 31, 2006. Cash flows from operating activities provided $544.8 million, primarily attributable to income from continuing operations and cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations before the sale. This increase was offset in part by the approximately $445 million tax payment on the gain on sale of discontinued operations included in Other current liabilities. Cash flows from investing activities used $1.0 billion, primarily attributable to the funding of the CAM and Permal acquisitions. Financing activities provided $687.3 million, primarily due to the issuance of long term debt related to the acquisition of CAM. The amounts above have been revised to include the activities attributable to operating, investing, and financing cash flows from discontinued operations. We expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will be the primary source of working capital for the next year. As of March 31, 2006, we had debt with an outstanding balance of $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million over the prior year primarily attributable to the addition of the $700 million, 5 year term loan in connection with the CAM acquisition described above, offset in part, by the conversion of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes and by the maturity of the $100.0 million principal amount of senior notes on February 15, 2006, which bore interest at a stated rate of 6.5%. The $100.0 million senior notes were repaid with cash on hand. During fiscal 2006, holders of zero coupon contingent convertible notes aggregating $479.9 million principal amount at maturity converted the notes into approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock. The convertible notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers at an initial offering price of $440.70 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. The discounted price reflects a yield to maturity of 2.75% per year. The remaining accreted balance at March 31, 2006 was $32.9 million. Legg Mason expects to redeem the convertible notes for cash on June 6, 2006 at their accreted value; however, the notes may be converted prior to redemption. Included in the outstanding debt is our $425.0 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The accreted balance at March 31, 2006 was $424.6 million. Proceeds from our long term debt have been primarily used to fund the acquisition of asset management entities. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2006 were BBB+ for Standard and Poors Rating Services and A3 for Moodys Investor Service, Inc. On August 1, 2001, Legg Mason purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400.0 million to the former owners of PCM. Based upon revenue levels as of March 31, 2006, PCM has earned the remaining fifth anniversary payment of $300.0 million. This payment is due in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and we intend to fund this obligation with cash from operations and available credit facilities, as necessary. During fiscal 2005, we made a final contingent payment of $100.0 million to the former owners of Royce, which represented the maximum contingent amount due. The final contingent payment for Royce was funded from cash on hand. The contingent payments were recorded as additional goodwill. 50 Table of Contents In March 2005, we filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement, which increased to approximately $1.25 billion the amount we had available for the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. A shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable. We intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of our business. There are no assurances as to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they are dependent on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance. On December 21, 2004, Legg Mason sold 4.6 million shares of common stock at $70.30 per share, less underwriting fees, for net proceeds of approximately $311 million. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included acquisitions. The Board of Directors previously authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, we repurchased 734,700 shares for $40.7 million and 1,183,950 shares for $65.4 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2006, the maximum amount of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is 699,200. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we paid cash dividends of $78.6 million, $51.7 million, and $35.2 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Special Purpose and Variable Interest Entities under Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments Legg Mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 7, 8, and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. 51 Table of Contents The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations at March 31, 2006 (In millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings by contract maturity $ 83.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ 83.2 Long term borrowings by contract maturity(1) 37.0 4.2 445.2 4.6 703.1 9.4 1,203.5 Coupon interest on long term borrowings(2) 71.4 69.2 53.6 37.0 24.7 2.1 258.0 Minimum rental commitments 85.0 62.1 55.3 47.8 39.1 141.1 430.4 Total Contractual Obligations 276.6 135.5 554.1 89.4 766.9 152.6 1,975.1 Contingent Obligations: Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(3) 612.0 252.0 7.5 293.5 60.0 1,225.0 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(4) $ 888.6 $ 387.5 $ 561.6 $ 382.9 $ 766.9 $ 212.6 $ 3,200.1 (1) Included in the payments in 2007 is $33.0, reflecting amounts due to holders of the zero coupon convertible senior notes, which represents the accreted value on the exercised redemption call date of June 6, 2006. (2) Coupon interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates outstanding at March 31, 2006. (3) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. Includes contingent payments in fiscal 2007 for PCM and CAM of $300.0 each. (4) The table above does not include approximately $42.1 in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2007 to 2011. MARKET RISK The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is based on the market value of our assets under management. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our assets under management to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity assets under management are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of assets under management and underperformance of advisory contracts versus the applicable performance benchmarks will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. Investments Legg Mason invests in sponsored mutual funds, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. The value of such held to maturity investments at March 31, 2006 was $17.3 million. Legg Mason has also made certain available for sale investments of $7.5 million at March 31, 2006. Declines in market values of these investments may negatively impact Legg Masons revenues, net income and comprehensive income. Trading Assets Of our securities owned, $142.2 million are classified as trading assets. Substantially all of these assets are related to long term incentive compensation plans of subsidiaries that have corresponding liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will have no impact on our operating revenues and will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. As a result of the 52 Table of Contents sale of the PCM/CM businesses on December 1, 2005, we no longer hold an inventory of trading securities in the normal course of business and therefore have a substantially lower level of market risk related to trading assets and other financial instruments. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity Legg Mason operates primarily in the United States, but provides services, earns revenues and incurs expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia, may impact our comprehensive income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income, comprehensive income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is not material as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. In addition, a significant portion of our outstanding floating rate debt is hedged through an interest rate swap that reduces our exposure in a rising interest rate environment. Gains and losses in the market value of the swap will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as long as the hedge is effective as a cash flow hedge. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names. Management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost above identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed. As of March 31, 2006, we had approximately $2.3 billion in goodwill, $3.9 billion in indefinite life intangible assets and $622.2 million in net amortizable 53 Table of Contents intangible assets. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 5 to 20 years. Goodwill is evaluated quarterly at the reporting unit level and is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows and multiples of revenues, similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Mutual Funds/Managed Services, Institutional and Wealth Management divisions. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of goodwill under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, the growth rate used in projecting the cash flows, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized fiscal year to date cash flows for the reporting unit and are projected forward forty years. Annual cash flow growth rates are based on historical growth rates realized by the reporting unit. The Wealth Management and Mutual Funds/Managed Services reporting units represent approximately 54% and 38%, respectively, of our goodwill. Wealth Management goodwill is principally attributable to PCM and Mutual Funds/Managed Services goodwill is principally attributable to CAM. Projected cash flows for these divisions are assumed to grow 10% annually over the next five years, with a long term annual growth rate of 5%. The projected cash flows are discounted at 16% to determine the present value. The discount rate is based on risk adjusted estimated weighted average cost of capital. For the Wealth Management reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to fall by over 40% or the discount rate increased to over 20% for the asset to be deemed impaired. For the Mutual Funds/Managed Services reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to fall by over 45% or the discount rate increased to over 25% for the asset to be deemed impaired. We review the fair value of our intangible assets on a quarterly basis, considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue multiples, to determine whether the assets are impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current implied fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. The implied fair values of intangible assets subject to amortization are determined at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts, and attrition rates and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current assets under management for the applicable contracts. Contracts are assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The expected life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. Management contract intangible assets related to CAM and PCM represent approximately 47% and 35%, respectively, of our total amortizable intangible assets. The CAM intangible asset related to individual client contracts has an expected life of 12 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 8%). Contract cash flows on the CAM contract would have to decline by approximately 45% before the asset would be deemed impaired or client attrition that decreases the estimated life by more than 50% would result in impairment. The PCM intangible asset related to client contracts had an original expected life of 18 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 6%), with an expected remaining life of 13 years at March 31, 2006. At current expected client attrition rates, the cash flows generated by the underlying management contracts held by PCM would have to decline by approximately 60% for the asset to become impaired. Similarly, with no change to 54 Table of Contents the profitability of the contracts, client attrition would have to accelerate to a rate such that our estimated useful life would decline by approximately 65% before the asset would be deemed impaired. For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent, trade names. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of indefinite life intangible assets related to proprietary fund contracts include the projected cash flows generated by those contracts and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward up to forty years, assuming annual cash flow growth approximating market returns. Contracts within the same family of funds are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund family are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. The intangible assets related to the CAM domestic mutual fund contracts and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts comprise approximately 65% and 24%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. Cash flows from the CAM and Permal contracts are assumed to grow at long term annual rates of 5% and 8%, respectively, which approximates expected average market returns of the underlying fund asset classes. The projected cash flows from the CAM and Permal funds are discounted at 13% and 14%, respectively, based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the respective businesses. Changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in an impairment. At current profitability levels, cash flows generated by the CAM mutual fund contracts would have to fall approximately 10% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised to 14% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Likewise, cash flows generated by the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to fall by approximately 25% or the discount rate raised to 18% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Given that CAM and Permal assets were recently acquired, implied fair values at March 31, 2006 are not significantly different from the values recorded at acquisition. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM, Royce and Permal involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Historically, contingent payments have been recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Loss Contingencies Legg Mason has been the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities, including certain class actions, which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages, which could be substantial. Legg Mason is also involved in governmental and self regulatory agency inquiries, investigations and proceedings. With the sale of our private client and capital markets businesses, we agreed to indemnify Citigroup for most customer complaints, litigation and regulatory liabilities that result from pre closing events. Similarly, Citigroup has agreed to be liable to Legg Mason for most customer complaints litigation and regulatory liabilities of the CAM business that result from pre closing events. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, we have established liabilities for potential losses from such complaints, legal actions, investigations and proceedings. In establishing 55 Table of Contents these liabilities, we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses have been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses. In making these decisions, we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations, consultations with legal counsel and our historical experience in resolving similar matters. In many lawsuits, arbitrations and regulatory proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. However, accruals are reviewed monthly and are adjusted to reflect our estimates of the impact of developments, rulings, advice of counsel and any other information pertinent to a particular matter. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory actions, we cannot predict with certainty the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters. If our judgments prove to be incorrect, our liability for losses and contingencies may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions, which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, our liability for losses and contingencies was $4.3 million and $27.3 million, respectively. The most significant component of the liability balance at March 31, 2005 reflects an approximate $20.0 million verdict rendered in October 2003 for a copyright infringement lawsuit, which was subsequently settled in fiscal 2006 for $11,500. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue stock options to officers, key employees and non employee members of our Board of Directors. Prior to April 1, 2003, we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended. In accordance with APB No. 25, prior to fiscal 2004, compensation expense was not recognized for stock options because they had no intrinsic value on the date of grant, since the exercise price of the options was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock. During fiscal 2004, we adopted the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, prospectively for stock options granted and stock purchase plan transactions after April 1, 2003, using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Market based performance grants are valued with a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Under the prospective method allowed under SFAS No. 148, compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of stock options granted after April 1, 2003 over the applicable vesting period. No compensation expense is recognized for stock options granted prior to April 1, 2003. Therefore, the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 is less than that which would have been included if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 148, we provide disclosure in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the pro forma results under the modified prospective fair value based method, as if compensation expense associated with all stock option grants had been recognized over their respective vesting period. If we accounted for prior years stock option grants under the modified prospective fair value based method, net income from continuing operations would have been reduced by $3.2 million, $7.9 million and $9.8 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net income from discontinued operations would have been reduced by $4.0 million, $6.1 million and $7.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These reductions are primarily the result of the impact of the inclusion of additional years of expense in the actual results of operations since the adoption in fiscal 2004. We granted 1,106,105, 574,035 and 914,475 stock options in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for 56 Table of Contents performance or market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility in part based upon the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. For market based (performance) option grants, we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model to estimate the fair value. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123 (SFAS No. 123(R)) requiring companies to record share based payment transactions as compensation expense at fair market value under either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) until the start of our fiscal year 2007. Legg Mason will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2007, using the modified prospective transition method. It is expected that the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will reduce fiscal 2007 net income by approximately $3.2 million. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the Federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that Legg Mason will be able to realize its deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we determine that our estimates have changed, the income tax provision will be adjusted in the period in which that determination is made. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding income taxes. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The following relevant accounting pronouncements were recently issued. Variable interest entities: The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus in June 2005 regarding Issue 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, that a general partner of a limited partnership is presumed to control the limited partnership, unless the limited partners have substantive termination rights or participating rights. In July 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) SOP 78 9 1, Interaction of AICPA 57 Table of Contents Statement of Position 78 9 and EITF Issue No. 04 5. This staff position eliminates the concept of important rights of Statement 78 9 and replaces it with the concept of kick out rights and substantive participating rights as defined in Issue 04 5. The EITF also reached a consensus in June 2005 on Issue 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights. The guidance from these standards is effective for all general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified after June 29, 2005. For all other limited partnerships, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We have adopted and will adopt the guidance in these pronouncements, as applicable. Adoption of these accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Share based compensation: The FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment, in December 2004. In 2005 and 2006, the FASB issued staff positions addressing implementation of SFAS No. 123 (R). The FASB also issued a staff position, FSP EITF 00 19 1, Application of EITF Issue No. 00 19 to Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued as Employee Compensation, which will be effective upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R). The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 concerning staff positions on share based payment. We will adopt SFAS No. 123 (R) in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2007 and we expect that it will reduce net income for the year by approximately $3.2 million. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other: As disclosed previously, in December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act, which was signed into law on October 22, 2004, provided for a one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to US taxpayers. We have determined that no repatriation of foreign earnings will be made, and, accordingly, there will be no effect on our U.S. income tax provision. 58 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Information or statements provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason from time to time, including those within this Annual Report on Form 10 K, may contain certain forward looking information, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of our client assets under management, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. We caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of assets under management; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible and goodwill values. See discussion of Market Risks Revenues and Net Income and Critical Accounting Policies Intangibles and Goodwill previously discussed. ITEM 7A.
