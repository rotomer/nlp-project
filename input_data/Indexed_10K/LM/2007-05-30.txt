ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise Legg Mason) is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. On December 1, 2005, we completed a strategic acquisition to become a pure asset management company in which we transferred our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses (PC/CM) to Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) as a portion of the consideration in exchange for substantially all of Citigroups asset management business (CAM). Prior to the closing of this transaction, we reported the PC/CM businesses as separate business segments; however, both businesses are now included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Effective November 1, 2005, we also purchased Permal Group Ltd (Permal), a leading global funds of hedge funds manager, to expand our global asset management business. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction with Citigroup and the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the sale of our PC/CM businesses to Citigroup, the portion of parent company interest income and expense and general corporate overhead costs that was previously allocated to these businesses is now included in our continuing operations. In addition, distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in continuing operations as distribution fee revenue, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties, including parties that were related prior to the sale, as distribution and servicing expense. All periods presented have been restated to reflect these changes. We now operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, with three divisions: Managed Investments, Institutional, and Wealth Management. Managed Investments is primarily engaged in providing investment advisory services to proprietary investment funds or to retail separately managed account programs. Institutional focuses on providing asset management services to institutional clients. Wealth Management is primarily focused on providing asset management services to high net worth individuals and families and endowments and includes our funds of hedge funds business. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the aggregation of operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. 33 Table of Contents As such, our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been affected by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes in the post Enron era. In addition, the financial services industry has been the subject of a number of regulatory proceedings and requirements over the last few years, including proceedings regarding a number of mutual funds sales practices. The Sarbanes Oxley Act continues to require us to review existing policies with respect to corporate governance, auditor independence and internal controls over financial reporting. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of the PC/CM businesses in fiscal 2006, the results of Private Client and Capital Markets segments are reflected in discontinued operations. Private Client distributed a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client were commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fee based account fees and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment were reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. Capital Markets consisted of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and 34 Table of Contents public finance. The primary sources of revenue for equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading included commissions and principal credits on transactions in both corporate and municipal products. We maintained proprietary fixed income and equity securities inventories primarily to facilitate customer transactions and as a result recognized trading profits and losses from our trading activities. Corporate finance revenues included underwriting fees and advisory fees from private placements and mergers and acquisitions. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings were reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also included realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment in the United States during fiscal 2007 was mixed and, despite investor concerns about rising interest rates, high fuel prices, a downturn in housing markets, turbulence in the Middle East, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, all three major market indexes rose during the fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average(1), Nasdaq Composite Index(2) and the S&P 500(3) were up 11%, 3% and 10%, respectively, for the fiscal year. During fiscal 2007, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% two times to bring the federal funds rate to 5.25%. 35 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change* 2007 Years EndedMarch 31, 2006 2005 2007Comparedto 2006 2006Comparedto 2005 Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 33.3 % 41.6 % 49.2 % 31.3 % 42.6 % Funds 46.5 37.6 29.3 103.5 115.8 Performance fees 3.3 3.8 3.1 40.0 107.8 Distribution and service fees 16.5 16.1 16.7 68.3 62.7 Other 0.4 0.9 1.7 (28.7 ) (17.8 ) Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 64.2 68.4 Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 35.8 40.6 42.1 44.9 62.3 Transaction related compensation 0.3 2.0 (77.1 ) n/m Total compensation and benefits 36.1 42.6 42.1 39.2 70.3 Distribution and servicing 27.5 21.2 16.1 112.9 121.7 Communications and technology 4.0 3.4 3.0 95.2 92.7 Occupancy 2.3 1.9 1.8 96.7 85.3 Amortization of intangible assets 1.6 1.5 1.4 77.9 80.7 Litigation award settlement (0.3 ) n/m n/m Other 4.8 4.0 4.5 96.2 48.6 Total operating expenses 76.3 74.3 68.9 68.7 81.7 Operating Income 23.7 25.7 31.1 51.3 39.0 Other Income (Expense) Interest income 1.4 1.8 1.3 22.8 139.3 Interest expense (1.6 ) (2.0 ) (2.8 ) 35.8 17.6 Other 0.5 1.5 0.4 (30.4 ) 536.3 Total other income (expense) 0.3 1.3 (1.1 ) (56.5 ) 294.6 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests 24.0 27.0 30.0 45.9 52.0 Income tax provision 9.1 10.4 11.2 44.3 57.2 Income from Continuing Operationsbefore Minority Interests 14.9 16.6 18.8 46.9 48.9 Minority interests, net of tax (0.2 ) n/m n/m Income from Continuing Operations 14.9 16.4 18.8 49.0 46.8 Income from discontinued operations,net of tax 2.5 7.2 n/m (41.2 ) Gain on sale of discontinued operations,net of tax 24.4 n/m n/m Net Income 14.9 % 43.3 % 26.0 % (43.5 ) 180.1 n/m not meaningful * Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 36 Table of Contents FISCAL 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2006 Financial Overview Since our strategic transaction with Citigroup was completed on December 1, 2005, in which we acquired the CAM business and sold the PC/CM businesses, we have retroactively reflected the results of operations of the PC/CM businesses as discontinued operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005. Effective November 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the acquisitions, the results of our continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 include a full year of results from CAM and Permal, while the results of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 include four months of results from CAM and five months of results from Permal. For the fiscal year, net income and diluted earnings per share declined 43%, to $646.8 million, and 49%, to $4.48, respectively, from the prior year as a result of the after tax gain on the sale of the PC/CM businesses of $644.0 million, or $4.94 per diluted share, recognized in the prior year. Income from continuing operations totaled $646.2 million, up 49% from the prior year and income from continuing operations per diluted share increased 34% to $4.48 despite an 11% increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Operating revenues increased to $4.3 billion from $2.6 billion, an increase of 64%. The Companys revenues, expenses and income from continuing operations increased primarily as a result of the addition of a full years results of CAM and Permal. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 24.0% from 27.0% in the prior year, primarily as a result of the addition of a full years results of CAM and Permal. Increases in distribution revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense, and an increase in other non compensation related expenses were offset in part by decreases in compensation and benefits as a percent of revenue, due in part to higher revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our subsidiaries which retain a lower percentage of revenues as compensation, transaction related compensation, and other non operating income. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 33.2% from 34.3% in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in other non compensation related expenses and a decrease in non operating income, offset in part by reduced compensation and benefits, as a percent of total revenue, and transaction related compensation. In the prior year, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $66.4 million; diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51 in the prior year. Assets Under Management Assets under management (AUM) at March 31, 2007 were $968.5 billion, up $100.9 billion or 12% from March 31, 2006. Net client cash flows for the fiscal year were $44.2 billion, representing 5% of our AUM at March 31, 2006, and were driven by approximately $27 billion in each of fixed income and liquidity flows, while negative client cash flows in equity assets resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, were approximately $10 billion. We generally earn higher fees and profit margins on equity AUM and outflows in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues and net income. The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2007 2006 Beginning of period $ 867.6 $ 374.5 Net client cash flows 44.2 35.6 Market performance and other 57.5 36.9 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (0.8 ) 420.6 End of period $ 968.5 $ 867.6 Average AUM for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were $905.8 billion and $546.9 billion, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Our AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2007 % ofTotal 2006 % ofTotal %Change Equity $ 338.0 34.9 $ 324.9 37.5 4.0 Fixed Income 470.9 48.6 410.6 47.3 14.7 Liquidity 159.6 16.5 132.1 15.2 20.8 Total $ 968.5 100.0 $ 867.6 100.0 11.6 AUM by Division Our AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2007 % ofTotal 2006 % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 403.2 41.6 $ 356.5 41.1 13.1 Institutional 496.3 51.3 444.8 51.3 11.6 Wealth Management 69.0 7.1 66.3 7.6 4.1 Total $ 968.5 100.0 $ 867.6 100.0 11.6 The components of the changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2007 were as follows: ManagedInvestments Institutional WealthManagement TotalAUM March 31, 2006 $ 356.5 $ 444.8 $ 66.3 $ 867.6 Net clientcash flows 23.5 21.7 (1.0 ) 44.2 Market performanceand other 23.3 30.2 4.0 57.5 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (0.1 ) (0.4 ) (0.3 ) (0.8 ) March 31, 2007 $ 403.2 $ 496.3 $ 69.0 $ 968.5 Assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients accounted for 67% and 68% of total assets managed and non U.S. domiciled clients represented 33% and 32% of total assets managed as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Assets managed for non U.S. domiciled clients as of March 31, 2006 have been revised to include $19.3 billion of assets previously included as assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients, principally non U.S. domiciled feeder funds. The following discussion separately addresses the results of our continuing operations and our discontinued operations. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2007 were $4.3 billion, up 64% from $2.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of including a full years results of CAM and Permal, including Permals growth since acquisition, which combined accounted for approximately 90% of the increase in revenues. Higher average AUM, reflecting favorable market conditions and net client cash flows, also contributed to the increase. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 31% to $1.4 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisition of CAM, which accounted for approximately 80% of the increase, as well as higher AUM at Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset), Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC (Brandywine) and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. (LMCM), offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by Private Capital Management, LP (PCM). Investment advisory fees from funds increased 103% to $2.0 billion, with approximately 90% of the increase attributable to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal, including Permals growth since acquisition. Performance fees increased 40% to $142.2 million during fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of $31.9 million of increased fees earned by Permal. 38 Table of Contents Distribution and service fees increased 68% to $716.4 million with approximately 75% of the increase due to the addition of fees earned by CAM. In addition, distribution and service fees from Permal contributed approximately 10% of the increase. Revenues by Division Our operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2007 2006(1) Managed Investments $ 2,444.4 $ 1,364.0 Institutional 970.0 717.6 Wealth Management 929.3 563.6 Total $ 4,343.7 $ 2,645.2 (1) Fiscal year 2006 includes a reclassification of approximately $29.4 million and $4.6 million from the Institutional and Wealth Management divisions, respectively, to the Managed Investments division to reflect a change whereby the revenues generated by all proprietary funds, except those managed by Permal, are included in the Managed Investments division. The increase in operating revenues in the Managed Investments and Institutional divisions was primarily due to including a full years results of CAM. The increase in the operating revenues in the Wealth Management division was primarily due to including a full years results of Permal, including growth since acquisition, offset in part by decreases at PCM. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 39% to $1.6 billion, primarily as a result of the addition of compensation costs from the acquired businesses and increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our other subsidiaries. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 36.1% for the year ended March 31, 2007, down from 42.6%, primarily as a result of higher revenues at revenue share entities, including revenues transferred from acquired entities, which retain a lower percentage of revenues as compensation, and a decrease in transaction related compensation. Transaction related compensation costs primarily include recognition of previously deferred compensation for CAM employees under prior Citigroup plans and accruals for retention compensation for transitional CAM employees. Costs for severance at CAM are included in the purchase price allocation and are not reflected in our results of operations. Compensation as a percentage of revenues also decreased as a result of the significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 113% to $1.2 billion, with approximately 80% of the increase resulting from the addition of the acquired businesses. The majority of distribution and servicing expenses are paid to Citigroup, who is our primary distributor. Communications and technology, occupancy, amortization of intangible assets and other expenses all increased primarily as a result of a full year of expenses related to the CAM operations. The increase in other expenses was primarily from travel, professional fees and advertising costs. The litigation award settlement during fiscal 2006 reflects the reversal of $8.2 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2004 as a result of the settlement of a civil copyright infringement lawsuit. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $10.9 million to $58.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned on higher average firm investment account balances. Interest expense increased $18.8 million to $71.5 million primarily due to the impact of a full year of interest expense on a $700 million term loan issued to finance the acquisition of CAM, offset in part by the 39 Table of Contents repayment at maturity of $100 million in senior notes during fiscal 2006 and the conversion of our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes to common stock. Other income decreased $12.3 million to $28.1 million as a result of investments held by variable interest entities (VIEs) that are no longer consolidated, offset in part by corresponding minority interests. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased 44.3% to $397.6 million, primarily as a result of the increase in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% from 38.5% in the prior year primarily reflecting increased revenues and earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash income from continuing operations rose 59% for the fiscal year to $845.4 million or $5.86 per diluted share from $532.1 million or $4.10 per diluted share primarily due to including a full years results of CAM and Permal. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations as adjusted for distribution and servicing expense for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 was 33.2% and 34.3%, respectively. Cash Income from Continuing Operations As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for cash income from continuing operations that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We define cash income from continuing operations as income from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets. We believe that cash income from continuing operations provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and it facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. We also believe that cash income from continuing operations is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. In considering acquisitions, we often calculate a target firms cash earnings as a metric in estimating its value. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income from operations is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. Legg Mason considers cash income from continuing operations to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value and because it facilitates comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense does not represent an actual decline in the value of the intangible assets. Deferred taxes on intangible assets, including goodwill, represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits, we add them to income in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Should a disposition or impairment charge occur, its impact on cash income from continuing operations may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact on cash income from continuing operations for distorting effects and ensure appropriate explanations accompany disclosures of cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 40 Table of Contents We have revised our definition of cash income from continuing operations. The changes relate to the treatment of stock based compensation expense and the timing of tax effects associated with the amortization of intangibles. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we no longer adjust for stock based compensation expense. In addition, to more consistently reflect the timing of tax effects on our non GAAP adjustments, we now add back to income from continuing operations amortization expense for intangible assets before taxes, rather than adding such expense net of taxes. We have applied these changes to all periods presented. However, the adjustments do not have a significant aggregate impact on the amount of cash income from continuing operations for the periods presented. A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, Period to Period Change 2007 2006 Income from Continuing Operations $ 646,246 $ 433,707 49.0 % Plus: Amortization of intangible assets 68,410 38,460 77.9 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets(1) 130,758 59,940 118.1 Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 845,414 $ 532,107 58.9 Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 4.48 $ 3.35 33.7 Amortization of intangible assets 0.47 0.29 62.1 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.91 0.46 97.8 Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 5.86 $ 4.10 42.9 (1) Increase from prior year primarily relates to deferred income taxes on intangible assets and goodwill on acquired entities for a full fiscal year. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted We believe that pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. 41 Table of Contents A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2007 2006 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 4,343,675 $ 2,645,212 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 1,196,019 561,788 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 3,147,656 $ 2,083,424 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests $ 1,043,854 $ 715,462 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis 24.0 % 27.0 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted 33.2 34.3 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the year ended March 31, 2006, was $66.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $0.6 million and $644.0 million, respectively. Gain on sale of discontinued operations had no impact on our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and was responsible for $4.94 per diluted share in fiscal 2006. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2005 Financial Overview As a result of the acquisitions of Permal and CAM, the results of our continuing operations for fiscal 2006 include five months of results from Permal and four months of results from CAM. Operating revenues increased 68% to $2.6 billion as a result of higher revenues from significantly increased levels of AUM primarily from the CAM and Permal acquisitions. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended March 31, 2006 also increased significantly compared to the prior year. Net income increased to $1.1 billion from $408.4 million, or 180%, and diluted earnings per share increased to $8.80 from $3.53, up 149%, primarily due to a net gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $644.0 million, or $4.94 per share. Income from continuing operations totaled $433.7 million, up 47% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. Higher levels of AUM at Western Asset and LMCM also contributed to the increase. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations was 27%, down from 30% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the pre tax profit margin was primarily due to a significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense, and to transaction related compensation costs related to the CAM acquisition. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 34.3% from 35.7% in fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of transaction related compensation costs related to the CAM acquisition. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.35, an increase of 31% from $2.56. Weighted average diluted shares increased 11% to 130.3 million due primarily to the issuance of common and non voting convertible preferred shares in connection with the acquisition of CAM. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $66.4 million, down 41% from the prior year primarily due to the sale of the PC/CM businesses on December 1, 2005. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51, a decrease of 47% from $0.97 for the prior year. All share and earnings per share numbers have been restated for fiscal 2005, where appropriate, for a 3 for 2 stock split effective September 24, 2004. 42 Table of Contents Assets Under Management AUM at March 31, 2006 were $867.6 billion, up $493.1 billion or 132% from March 31, 2005. The acquisitions of CAM and Permal were responsible for approximately $426.1 billion or 86% of the net increase. Net client cash flows were responsible for $35.6 billion or 7% of the increase.

The following discussion separately addresses the results of continuing operations and the results of our discontinued operations. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2006 were $2.6 billion, up 68% from $1.6 billion in the prior year as a result of growth in AUM, including increases from acquisitions. The CAM and Permal acquisitions accounted for 70% of the increase in revenues. Strong growth in aggregate AUM experienced by Western Asset and LMCM also contributed to the increase. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 43% to $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisition of CAM and growth in assets managed at Western Asset. CAM and Western Asset accounted for 41% and 28% of the increase, respectively. Collectively PCM, Brandywine, and LMCM accounted for 23% of the increased investment advisory fees from separate accounts. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 116% to $1.0 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. CAM and Permal accounted for 86% of the increase in investment advisory fees from funds. Increases in fund assets managed by Royce and Associates, LLC (Royce) and LMCM accounted for 7% of the increase. Performance fees rose $52.7 million to $101.6 million during fiscal 2006, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Permal. Distribution and service fees increased 63% to $425.6 million, with $120.5 million, or 73% of the increase, due to the addition of CAM. Other operating revenues decreased by 18% to $22.6 million, primarily as a result of declines in commissions earned by PCMs related broker dealer. Revenue by Division Our operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2006(1) 2005(1) Managed Investments $ 1,364.0 $ 740.5 Institutional 717.6 501.8 Wealth Management 563.6 328.4 Total $ 2,645.2 $ 1,570.7 (1) Fiscal years 2006 and 2005 include reclassifications of approximately $29.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively, from the Institutional division, and $4.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, from the Wealth Management division, to the Managed Investments division to reflect a change whereby the revenues generated by all proprietary funds, except those managed by Permal, are included in the Managed Investments division. The increases in operating revenues in the Managed Investments and Institutional divisions were primarily due to the acquisition of CAM. The increase in the operating revenues of the Wealth Management division is primarily due to the inclusion of Permals revenues. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 70% to $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of the addition of transaction related compensation costs from the acquired businesses, including compensation related to the CAM acquisition, and increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our other subsidiaries. Compensation as a percentage of 44 Table of Contents operating revenues was 42.6% for the year ended March 31, 2006, up from 42.1%, resulting from the transaction related compensation discussed above, offset in part by the significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 122% to $561.8 million, primarily as a result of the addition of $183.4 million in distribution and service fee expense at CAM. Permal also contributed to the increase. Communications and technology, occupancy, and amortization of intangible assets expense all increased primarily as a result of the addition of expenses related to the CAM acquisition. The litigation award settlement reflects the reversal of $8.2 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2004 as a result of the settlement of a civil copyright infringement lawsuit in the current period. Other expenses increased 49% to $106.0 million, primarily due to increased promotional costs at CAM and professional fees. In connection with the acquisition of CAM and sale of the PC/CM businesses, Legg Mason and Citigroup entered into mutual transition services agreements to provide certain administrative services (other than investment advisory services) provided by the seller to the transferred business in the ordinary course prior to the date of sale. Under each agreement, the respective services are to be provided for up to eighteen months with a provision for an additional six month renewal. The service recipient may terminate the services on an individual basis with notice. For the four months ended March 31, 2006, Other expenses include approximately $14.9 million of costs for services provided to the CAM operations by Citigroup and $16.8 million of expense reductions for cost of services provided to Citigroup for support of sold businesses. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $27.9 million to $48.0 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates on higher average firm investment account balances. Interest expense increased $7.9 million to $52.6 million due to additional debt incurred in connection with the CAM acquisition, offset in part by the conversion of $479.9 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes to common stock. Other income increased $34.0 million to $40.4 million as a result of net gains on firm investments and gains from trading investments held by consolidated VIEs as a result of the Permal acquisition, which are offset in part by a corresponding minority interests allocation. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased 57% to $275.6 million, primarily as a result of the increase in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate increased to 38.5% from 37.2% in the prior years period primarily due to a higher provision for state income taxes as a result of the acquisition of CAM, which operates in state and local jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash income from continuing operations rose 45% for the fiscal year to $532.1 million or $4.10 per diluted share from $367.0 million or $3.17 per diluted share, primarily from the increase in income from continuing operations due to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted for distribution and servicing expense, for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was 34.3% and 35.7%, respectively. See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information in Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006 section regarding these non GAAP disclosures. 45 Table of Contents A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, Period to Period Change 2006 2005 Income from Continuing Operations $ 433,707 $ 295,424 46.8 % Plus: Amortization of intangible assets 38,460 21,286 80.7 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 59,940 50,291 19.2 Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 532,107 $ 367,001 45.0 Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 3.35 $ 2.56 30.9 Amortization of intangible assets 0.29 0.18 61.1 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.46 0.43 7.0 Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 4.10 $ 3.17 29.3 A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2006 2005 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,645,212 $ 1,570,700 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 561,788 253,394 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 2,083,424 $ 1,317,306 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests $ 715,462 $ 470,758 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis 27.0 % 30.0 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted 34.3 35.7 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Since the announcement of the transaction to sell the PC/CM businesses in June 2005, these businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction with Citigroup. Prior to the sale on December 1, 2005, the PC/CM businesses were business segments. Due to the sale of the PC/CM businesses on December 1, 2005, fiscal 2006 reflects results for eight months compared to twelve months in fiscal 2005. The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2006 were also negatively affected by the announcement of the transaction. As a result, net revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2006 decreased $310.7 million, or 36%, to $545.7 million. Income from discontinued operations before income tax decreased $78.5 million, or 42%. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51, a decrease of 47% from $0.97 in the prior year. 46 Table of Contents Financial results of discontinued operations by business segment (in thousands) were as follows: 2006 2005 NET REVENUES Private Client $ 502,400 $ 727,888 Capital Markets 168,751 306,653 671,151 1,034,541 Reclassification(1) (125,436 ) (178,175 ) Total $ 545,715 $ 856,366 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX PROVISION Private Client $ 100,289 $ 132,785 Capital Markets 9,115 55,164 Total $ 109,404 $ 187,949 (1) Represents distribution fees from proprietary mutual funds, historically reported in Private Client, that have been reclassified to Asset Management as distribution fee revenue, with a corresponding distribution expense, to reflect Legg Masons continuing role as funds distributor. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support Legg Masons business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of CAM in exchange for (i) all outstanding stock of Legg Mason subsidiaries that constituted our PC/CM businesses; (ii) 5,393,545 shares of common stock and 13.346632 shares of non voting Legg Mason convertible preferred stock, which is convertible, upon transfer, into 13,346,632 shares of common stock; and (iii) $512 million in cash borrowed under a $700 million five year syndicated term loan facility. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a post closing purchase price adjustment of $84.7 million to Citigroup in September 2006, based on the retention of certain AUM nine months after the closing. Since this contingent payment was paid from available cash, an unsecured 5 year, $300 million floating rate credit agreement that we had entered to fund this obligation terminated in accordance with its terms. During fiscal 2006, Legg Mason issued approximately 4.96 million common shares upon conversion of approximately 4.96 shares of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the CAM acquisition. The following table summarizes the credit facilities that were executed in connection with the CAM acquisition. The credit facilities include agreements to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The facilities have restrictive covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain specific leverage ratios. We have maintained compliance with the applicable covenants of these borrowing facilities. 47 Table of Contents Type AvailableAmount Outstandingat March 31,2007 Outstandingat March 31,2006 Interest Rate Maturity Purpose 5 Year Term Loan $ 700,000 $ 650,000 $ 700,000 LIBOR + 0.35 % October 2010 Purchase price Contingent 5 Year Credit Agreement(1) $ 300,000 $ $ LIBOR + 0.35 % November 2010 Acquisition costs 3 Year Term Loan(2) $ 16,000 $ 8,543 $ 15,776 Floating + 0.35 % November 2008 Purchase price Promissory Note(3) $ 83,227 $ $ 83,227 LIBOR + 0.35 % November 2006 Purchase price Revolving Credit Agreement $ 500,000 $ $ LIBOR + 0.35 % October 2010 Working capital Revolving Credit Agreement(1) $ 130,000 $ $ LIBOR + 0.27 % November 2006 Working capital (1) Terminated in fiscal 2007. There were no borrowings during fiscal 2007. (2) Loan denominated in Chilean Pesos. Floating rate linked to Bank of Chile offering rate. (3) Matured in fiscal 2007. On October 14, 2005, Legg Mason entered into a syndicated five year $700 million unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. At closing, we borrowed $600 million, of which $512 million was used to fund the cash portion of the purchase and the remainder was used to fund acquisition related expenses. The remaining $100 million of the $700 million loan facility was drawn down in February 2006 for additional acquisition related costs; $650 million remains outstanding as of March 31, 2007. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap (Swap) to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this Swap began to unwind and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. We currently intend to repay a minimum of $50 million per quarter of the current $650 million outstanding balance on this loan in order to match the amortization of the Swap. Also in connection with the Citigroup transaction, one of our subsidiaries was the borrower under a 364 day promissory note of $83.2 million. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we paid from available cash the balance outstanding on this note. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We have the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right is not exercised, the holders of those equity interests have the right to require Legg Mason to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The aggregate consideration paid by Legg Mason at closing was $800 million, of which $200 million was in the form of 1,889,322 newly issued shares of Legg Mason common stock and the remainder was cash. We funded the cash portion of the acquisition from existing cash. It is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining 20% ownership interest in Permal, and we will do so in purchases that will be made two and four years after the initial closing at prices based on Permals revenues. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, with a $961 million minimum price, excluding acquisition costs and dividends. Based upon current performance levels, as of March 31, 2007, $130 million of the $161 million difference between the minimum purchase price and consideration paid at closing is classified as Contractual acquisition payable, a current liability. We may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2007 we paid approximately $12 million in dividends on the preference shares, and we will pay a minimum of $27 million in dividends on the preference shares over the next 3 years. 48 Table of Contents Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents and investment advisory and related fees receivables. Our assets are principally funded by equity capital and long term debt. The investment advisory fee receivables are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds and commercial paper. The highly liquid nature of our current assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. At March 31, 2007, our total assets and stockholders equity were $9.6 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. During fiscal 2007, stockholders equity increased approximately $691.4 million, primarily due to the net income for the year. During the year ended March 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents increased by $160.1 million from $1.02 billion at March 31, 2006 to $1.18 billion at March 31, 2007. Cash flows from operating activities provided $905.5 million, primarily attributable to net income. Cash flows from investing activities used $542.1 million, primarily attributable to a contingent earnout payment to the previous owners of PCM, payments for fixed assets and the purchase price adjustment paid to Citigroup. Financing activities used $209.4 million, primarily due to payment of cash dividends and repayment of short term and long term borrowings. We expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will be the primary source of working capital for the next year. As of March 31, 2007, our outstanding debt balance was $1.1 billion. In addition to the $650.0 million five year term loan discussed previously, included in the outstanding debt is $425.0 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The accreted balance at March 31, 2007 was $424.8 million. During fiscal 2006, holders of zero coupon contingent convertible notes aggregating $479.9 million principal amount at maturity converted the notes into approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock. During fiscal 2007, all remaining outstanding zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes were converted into 756 thousand shares of common stock. Proceeds from our long term debt have been primarily used to fund the acquisition of asset management entities. On September 21, 2006, Moodys Investor Service, Inc. upgraded the rating on our senior, unsecured debt from A3 to A2. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2007 for Standard and Poors Rating Services and Fitch Ratings were BBB+ and A , respectively. On August 1, 2001, Legg Mason purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682.0 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400.0 million to the former owners of PCM. During the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we paid from available cash the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300.0 million, which was accrued as a liability with a corresponding increase to goodwill at March 31, 2006. This payment is subject to certain limited claw back provisions. We maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility of $500 million that matures on October 1, 2010, to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of March 31, 2007 or 2006. We have available under a shelf registration statement approximately $1.25 billion for the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. A shelf filing permits us to register securities in advance and then sell them when financing needs arise or market conditions are favorable. We intend to use the shelf registration for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of our business. There are no assurances as to the terms of any securities that may be issued pursuant to the shelf registration since they are dependent on market conditions and interest rates at the time of issuance. The Board of Directors previously authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our 49 Table of Contents common stock. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2007 and 2006. During fiscal 2005 we repurchased 734,700 shares for $40.7 million. As of March 31, 2007, the maximum amount of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is 666,200. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid cash dividends of $109.9 million, $78.6 million, and $51.7 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Special Purpose and Variable Interest Entities in Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments Legg Mason has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we have made or expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 7, 8, and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations at March 31, 2007 (In millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term borrowings by contract maturity $ 5.1 $ 438.8 $ 5.5 $ 654.0 $ 0.8 $ 8.6 $ 1,112.8 Coupon interest on long term borrowings(1) 65.2 48.4 33.2 24.9 0.5 1.6 173.8 Minimum rental commitments 97.2 108.8 104.1 82.7 76.2 630.9 1,099.9 Total Contractual Obligations 167.5 596.0 142.8 761.6 77.5 641.1 2,386.5 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2) 252.0 7.5 293.5 60.0 613.0 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(3) $ 419.5 $ 603.5 $ 436.3 $ 761.6 $ 137.5 $ 641.1 $ 2,999.5 (1) Coupon interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates outstanding at March 31, 2007. (2) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (3) The table above does not include approximately $39.3 in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2008 to 2011. 50 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges Prior to consummation of the CAM transaction, senior management assessed and formulated plans for restructuring the business of the combined entities, which included reductions in the acquired workforce, rationalization and realignment of the acquired mutual funds, and an evaluation of office lease obligations assumed in the transaction in several geographic regions. Costs associated with reductions of the acquired work force were accrued at acquisition date, at which time specific plans and the communication of those plans were finalized. Costs associated with mutual fund realignment and office space rationalization were accrued during fiscal 2007, as management finalized plans and amounts could be reasonably estimated. As part of the fund realignment, certain domestic funds have been or are being merged with funds of similar strategy and certain funds have been or are being re domiciled or liquidated, as approved by the Boards of Directors of the funds or fund shareholders. The fund realignment costs were not associated with or incurred to generate revenues of the combined entity after the consummation date, were incremental to other costs incurred in the conduct of activities prior to the transaction date, and were incurred as a direct result of the plan to exit certain CAM activities. The determination of excess office space in several geographic regions resulted from staff reductions and business integrations. Excess office space costs include both amounts incurred under existing contractual obligations of CAM that will continue with no economic benefit and penalties incurred to cancel contractual obligations of the acquired business. The costs for workforce reductions, mutual fund realignment and excess office space aggregating $85.4 million are associated with integration of the acquired CAM business and such costs are reflected as additional goodwill and only impact future earnings to the extent recorded goodwill becomes impaired. A summary of all accrued restructuring costs (in millions) follows: AcquiredWorkforceReductions FundRealignment OfficeLeases Total Accrued at acquisition $ 27.5 $ $ $ 27.5 Payments (19.5 ) (19.5 ) Accrual at March 31, 2006 8.0 8.0 Accruals 1.2 42.4 14.3 57.9 Payments (9.0 ) (37.2 ) (3.3 ) (49.5 ) Accrual at March 31, 2007 $ 0.2 $ 5.2 $ 11.0 $ 16.4 The purchase price allocation was completed during fiscal 2007, and we expect the remaining accrued costs to be paid as incurred or over their contractual terms in future years. MARKET RISK The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM and underperformance of advisory contracts versus the applicable performance benchmarks will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. 51 Table of Contents Investments Legg Mason invests in sponsored mutual funds, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. No investments were classified as held to maturity at March 31, 2007. Legg Mason has also made certain available for sale investments of $8.3 million at March 31, 2007. Declines in market values of these investments may negatively impact Legg Masons revenues, net income and comprehensive income. Trading Assets Of our securities owned, $273.2 million and $142.2 million as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are classified as trading assets. Approximately $153.7 million of these assets as of March 31, 2007 and substantially all of these assets as of March 31, 2006 are related to long term incentive compensation plans of subsidiaries that have corresponding liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will have no impact on our operating revenues and will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income. Approximately $35.3 million of these assets are seed capital investments that are economically hedged. Fluctuations in the market value of these assets will not have a material impact on our net income. Approximately $84.2 million of these assets, including approximately $37.9 million related to long term incentive compensation, represent investments in which fluctuations in market value may impact our non operating income and net income. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity Legg Mason operates primarily in the United States, but provides services, earns revenues and incurs expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia, may impact our comprehensive and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is not material as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. In addition, a significant portion of our outstanding floating rate debt is hedged through an interest rate swap that reduces our exposure in a rising interest rate environment. Gains and losses in the market value of the swap will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as long as the hedge is effective as a cash flow hedge. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are 52 Table of Contents indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination dates will be renewed. As of March 31, 2007, we had approximately $2.4 billion in goodwill, $3.9 billion in indefinite life intangible assets and $553.5 million in net amortizable intangible assets. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 5 to 20 years. As of March 31, 2007, amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over a remaining weighted average life of 11 years. Goodwill is evaluated quarterly at the reporting unit level and is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Managed Investments, Institutional and Wealth Management divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of goodwill under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, the growth rate used in projecting the cash flows, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Annual cash flow growth rates are based on historical growth rates. The Wealth Management and Managed Investments reporting units represent approximately 51% and 44%, respectively, of our goodwill. Wealth Management goodwill is principally attributable to PCM and Managed Investments goodwill is principally attributable to CAM. Projected cash flows for these divisions are assumed to grow 10% annually over the next five years, with a long term annual growth rate of 5%. The projected cash flows are discounted at 16% to determine the present value. The discount rate is based on risk adjusted estimated weighted average cost of capital. For the Wealth Management reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to decline by more than 35% or the discount rate increase to more than 20% for the goodwill to be deemed impaired. For the Managed Investments reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to decline by more than 50% or the discount rate increase to more than 25% for the goodwill to be deemed impaired. We review the fair value of our intangible assets on a quarterly basis, considering projected cash flows, to determine whether the assets are impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current implied fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. 53 Table of Contents The implied fair values of intangible assets subject to amortization are determined at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts, and attrition rates and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The expected life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. Management contract intangible assets related to the retail separately managed accounts acquired in the CAM acquisition and client contracts acquired with PCM represent approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, of our total amortizable intangible assets. This CAM intangible asset has an expected life of 12 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 8%). For CAM contracts to be impaired, contract cash flows would have to decline by approximately 70% or client attrition would have to accelerate to a rate such that the estimated life decreases by more than 65%. The PCM intangible asset related to client contracts had an original expected life of 18 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 6%), with an expected remaining life of 12 years at March 31, 2007. At current expected client attrition rates, the cash flows generated by the underlying management contracts held by PCM would have to decline by approximately 50% for the asset to become impaired. Similarly, with no change to the profitability of the contracts, client attrition would have to accelerate to a rate such that our estimated useful life would decline by approximately 35% before the asset would be deemed impaired. For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent, trade names. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of proprietary fund contracts include the projected cash flows generated by those contracts and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward forty years, assuming annual cash flow growth approximating market returns. Contracts within the same family of funds are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund family are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the CAM acquisition and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. Cash flows from the CAM and Permal contracts are assumed to grow at long term annual rates of 5% and 8%, respectively, which approximates the expected average market returns. The projected cash flows from the CAM and Permal funds are discounted at 13% and 14%, respectively, based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the respective businesses. Changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in an impairment. At current profitability levels, cash flows generated by the CAM mutual fund contracts would have to fall approximately 13% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised to 14% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Likewise, cash flows generated by the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to decline by approximately 36% or the discount rate raised to 20% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM, Royce and Permal involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Historically, contingent 54 Table of Contents payments have been recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Loss Contingencies Legg Mason has been the subject of customer complaints and has also been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage, asset management and investment banking activities, including certain class actions, which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages, which could be substantial. Legg Mason is also involved in governmental and self regulatory agency inquiries, investigations and proceedings. With the sale of our private client and capital markets businesses, we agreed to indemnify Citigroup for most customer complaints, litigation and regulatory liabilities that result from pre closing events. Similarly, Citigroup has agreed to be liable to Legg Mason for most customer complaints litigation and regulatory liabilities of the CAM business that result from pre closing events. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we have established liabilities for potential losses from complaints, legal actions, investigations and proceedings, exclusive of legal fees. In establishing these liabilities, we use our judgment to determine the probability that losses have been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses. In making these decisions, we base our judgments on our knowledge of the situations, consultations with legal counsel and our historical experience in resolving similar matters. In many lawsuits, arbitrations and regulatory proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. However, accruals are reviewed monthly and are adjusted to reflect our estimates of the impact of developments, rulings, advice of counsel and any other information pertinent to a particular matter. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory actions, we cannot predict with certainty the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters. If our judgments prove to be incorrect, our liability for losses and contingencies may not accurately reflect actual losses that result from these actions, which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined. As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, our liability for losses and contingencies was $2.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding contingencies. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue stock options to officers, key employees and non employee members of our Board of Directors. During fiscal year 2007, Legg Mason adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment and related pronouncements using the modified prospective method and the related transition election. Under this method, compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2007 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. As further described below, Legg Mason determines the fair value of stock based compensation using the Black Scholes option pricing model, with the exception of market based performance grants, which are valued with a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Prior to fiscal 2007, awards were also accounted for at grant date fair value, except for awards granted prior to April 1, 2003, that were recorded at their intrinsic value. As a result, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), no related compensation expense was recognized for the awards granted prior to April 1, 2003, and the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 is less than that which would have been included if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Under the modified prospective method, the results for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 have not been restated. Additionally, unamortized deferred 55 Table of Contents compensation previously classified as a separate component of stockholders equity has been reclassified as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under SFAS No. 123 (R), cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2007. For the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, such amount was $92,376 and $18,972, respectively, and continues to be classified as operating cash inflows. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), we provide disclosure in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our pro forma results if compensation expense associated with all stock option grants had been recognized at grant date fair value over their respective vesting period. If we accounted for prior years stock option grants at grant date fair value, net income from continuing operations would have been reduced by $3.2 million and $7.9 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income from discontinued operations would have been reduced by $4.0 million and $6.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. These reductions are the result of including additional expenses for grants made prior to April 2003. We granted 1,037,380, 1,101,105 and 579,104 stock options, including those to non employee directors, in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for performance or market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility in part based upon the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. For market based (performance) option grants, we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model to estimate the fair value. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the Federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that Legg Mason will be able to realize its deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we determine that our estimates have 56 Table of Contents changed, the income tax provision will be adjusted in the period in which that determination is made. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding income taxes. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) to prescribe recognition and measurement thresholds in financial statements for tax positions. As noted below, this new accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The following relevant accounting pronouncements were recently issued. The FASB issued FIN 48 in July 2006. FIN 48 clarifies previously issued FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by prescribing a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute in financial statements for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, interim accounting, disclosure and transition and will be effective for fiscal year 2008. We have substantially completed an analysis of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 and, based on that analysis, do not currently expect an adjustment to opening retained earnings or existing income tax reserves as of April 1, 2007, that will be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), to provide a consistent definition of fair value and establish a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 has additional disclosure requirements and will be effective for fiscal year 2009. We are evaluating the adoption of SFAS 157 and cannot estimate the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements at this time. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer that is a business entity that sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of its plans on its balance sheet as of the balance sheet date. SFAS 158 also requires gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that are not components of net periodic benefit costs to be cycled through other comprehensive income until recognized as net periodic benefit cost. SFAS 158 has additional disclosure requirements and is effective as of March 31, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), to eliminate diversity in how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements. Prior to SAB 108, registrants have used one of two widely recognized methods to quantify financial statement misstatements: the rollover method or the iron curtain method. The iron curtain method quantifies uncorrected misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatements existing in the balance sheet in the current year, irrespective of the year of origination of the misstatement. The rollover method quantifies uncorrected misstatements based on the amount of misstatements originating in the current year income statement and ignores the effects of correcting the portion relating to balance sheet misstatements from prior years. SAB 108 requires that a registrant consider both the iron curtain and rollover methods when evaluating uncorrected misstatements. As such, uncorrected misstatements previously deemed to be immaterial under one method, may now be material under the new dual approach and require correction in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 has additional disclosure requirements. SAB 108 has been adopted as of March 31, 2007 and did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 57 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of SFAS 159 are not mandatory and we have the option to adopt SFAS 159 for fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the potential future effect of SFAS 159 on our consolidated financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases can be, may be, expects, may affect, may depend, believes, estimate, project, anticipate and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. 58 Table of Contents EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible and goodwill values.
