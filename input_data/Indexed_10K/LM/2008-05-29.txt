Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (4) Calculated based on income from continuing operations before minority interests. (5) Calculated based on total debt as a percentage of total capital (total stockholders equity plus total debt) as of March 31. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise Legg Mason) is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, with three divisions: Managed Investments, Institutional, and Wealth Management. Managed Investments is primarily engaged in providing investment advisory services to proprietary investment funds or to retail separately managed account programs. Institutional focuses on providing asset management services to institutional clients. Wealth Management is primarily focused on providing asset management services to high net worth individuals and families and endowments and includes our funds of hedge funds business. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the aggregation of operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. 33 Table of Contents Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been affected by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes in the post Enron era. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. During much of fiscal 2008, and continuing thereafter, the fixed income markets have endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles (SIVs) became substantially reduced. As a result, we entered into several transactions during the fiscal year to provide support to liquidity funds that are managed by our asset managers that had invested in SIV issued securities. These transactions resulted in aggregate charges during fiscal year 2008 of $608.3 million ($313.7 million, net of income taxes and compensation related adjustments). On December 1, 2005, we completed a strategic acquisition to become a pure asset management company in which we transferred our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses (PC/CM) to Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) as a portion of the consideration in exchange for substantially all of Citigroups asset management business (CAM). Prior to the closing of this transaction, we reported the PC/CM businesses as separate business segments. However, both businesses are now included in discontinued operations for fiscal 2006 as described below. Effective November 1, 2005, we also purchased Permal Group Ltd (Permal), a leading global funds of hedge funds manager, to expand our global asset management business. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction with Citigroup and the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the sale of our PC/CM businesses to Citigroup, distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in continuing operations as distribution fee revenue, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties, including parties that were related prior to the sale, as distribution and servicing expense. All periods presented reflect this change. Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of the PC/CM businesses in fiscal 2006, the results of the Private Client and Capital Markets segments are reflected in discontinued operations. Private Client distributed a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client were 34 Table of Contents commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fee based account fees and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment were reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. Capital Markets consisted of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance. The primary sources of revenue for equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading included commissions and principal credits on transactions in both corporate and municipal products. We maintained proprietary fixed income and equity securities inventories primarily to facilitate customer transactions and as a result recognized trading profits and losses from our trading activities. Corporate finance revenues included underwriting fees and advisory fees from private placements and mergers and acquisitions. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings were reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also included realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities. All references to fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as we, us, our, and company refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States was volatile during fiscal 2008 and challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year. Continued contraction in worldwide credit markets due in part to sub prime lending issues, which began in the summer of 2007, a weaker U.S. dollar, major write downs related to the credit crisis within the financial sector, and record high oil prices continued to concern investors about the state of the U.S. and global economies. As a result, all three major U.S. equity market indices declined during the fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,(1) NASDAQ Composite Index(2) and the S&P 500(3) were down 1%, 6% and 7%, respectively, for the fiscal year. In addition, during fiscal 2008 the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to 2.25% at March 31, 2008, down from 5.25% a year ago in an effort to ease the impact of the credit crisis. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2009. We expect the challenges presented by the credit markets to persist throughout the next fiscal year. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. (1) Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

These transactions resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $608.3 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, an impairment charge of $151.0 million was recorded for a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 totaled $267.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, a decrease of 59% and 58%, respectively, from the prior year. Cash income from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $468.5 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, both representing a decrease of 45% from the prior year. These decreases were primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the impairment charge, net of income tax benefits, of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 9.6% from 24.0% in the prior year. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 13.2% from 33.2% in the prior year. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0% and 3.3%, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1% and 4.5%, respectively. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management (AUM) (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 2007 Beginning of period $ 968.5 $ 867.6 Net client cash flows (26.3 ) 44.2 Market performance and other 9.9 57.5 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (2.0 ) (0.8 ) End of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 AUM at March 31, 2008 were $950.1 billion, a decrease of $18.4 billion or 2% from March 31, 2007. Net client cash outflows for the fiscal year were $26.3 billion and were driven by outflows in equity assets of approximately $44 billion, resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, partially offset by approximately $15 billion and $3 billion of fixed income and liquidity inflows, respectively. Due in part to investment performance, we have experienced net equity outflows in each quarter since the September 2006 quarter. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Equity $ 271.6 28.6 $ 338.0 34.9 (19.6 ) Fixed Income 508.2 53.5 470.9 48.6 7.9 Liquidity 170.3 17.9 159.6 16.5 6.7 Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % ofTotal 2007 % ofTotal %Change Equity $ 327.6 33.1 $ 325.1 35.9 0.8 Fixed Income 498.6 50.3 441.9 48.8 12.8 Liquidity 163.9 16.6 138.8 15.3 18.1 Total $ 990.1 100.0 $ 905.8 100.0 9.3 AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % ofTotal 2007 % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 376.6 39.7 $ 403.2 41.6 (6.6 ) Institutional 511.4 53.8 496.3 51.3 3.0 Wealth Management 62.1 6.5 69.0 7.1 (10.0 ) Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) 37 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2008 were as follows: ManagedInvestments Institutional WealthManagement TotalAUM March 31, 2007 $ 403.2 $ 496.3 $ 69.0 $ 968.5 Net client cash flows (23.2 ) 2.5 (5.6 ) (26.3 ) Market performance and other (2.7 ) 12.6 9.9 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (0.7 ) (1.3 ) (2.0 ) March 31, 2008 $ 376.6 $ 511.4 $ 62.1 $ 950.1 Assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients accounted for 66% and 67% of total assets managed and non U.S. domiciled clients represented 34% and 33% of total assets managed as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % ofTotal 2007 % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 2,538.4 54.8 $ 2,444.4 56.3 3.8 Institutional 1,024.5 22.1 970.0 22.3 5.6 Wealth Management 1,071.2 23.1 929.3 21.4 15.3 Total $ 4,634.1 100.0 $ 4,343.7 100.0 6.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Managed Investments division was primarily due to increased mutual fund revenues at Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset) and Royce & Associates, LLC (Royce), partially offset by decreased mutual fund revenues at ClearBridge Advisors LLC (ClearBridge). The increase in operating revenues in the Institutional division was primarily due to increased separate account revenues at Western Asset and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC (Brandywine), partially offset by decreased performance fees at Western Asset. The increase in operating revenues in the Wealth Management division was primarily due to increased revenues, distribution and service fees and performance fees at Permal, partially offset by decreased separate account revenues at Private Capital Management, LP (PCM). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2008 were $4.6 billion, up 7% from $4.3 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 9% increase in average AUM, principally in the liquidity and fixed income asset classes. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 1%, or $18.7 million, to $1.46 billion, primarily as a result of higher average assets managed by Western Asset, Brandywine and Batterymarch Financial Management Inc., offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by PCM and ClearBridge. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 15% to $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets managed by Permal, Western Asset and Royce. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average assets managed by ClearBridge. Performance fees decreased 7%, or $9.5 million, to $132.7 million during fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of decreases in performance fees earned by Western Asset, and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. (LMCM), which were partially offset by an increase in performance fees earned by Permal. 38 Table of Contents Distribution and service fees decreased 3% to $692.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic equity funds. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits remained flat at $1.6 billion, as increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues along with higher salary and benefits at certain of our subsidiaries were substantially offset by incentive expense reductions related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that hold SIV issued securities. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges related to our liquidity business. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 33.9% for fiscal 2008, down from 36.1% for fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of a reduction in compensation resulting from adjustments related to liquidity fund support. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 7% to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased average AUM at Permal and in liquidity assets for which we pay higher relative fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense increased 11% to $192.8 million, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense, technology maintenance, and other expenditures related to investment management and business continuity infrastructure and office relocations. Occupancy expense increased 29% to $129.4 million, primarily as a result of higher rent at new office locations and the impact of duplicate rent on facilities during relocation periods. Expense for impairment of management contracts was $151.0 million, representing the write down of certain acquired management contracts as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition than previously estimated. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of management contracts. Other operating expenses increased 1% to $209.9 million, driven primarily by increased promotional expenses, offset in part by decreased expenses under a transition services agreement with Citigroup related to the integration of businesses acquired from Citigroup and prior year losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets as a result of office relocations. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $18.0 million to $76.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average firm investment account balances, offset in part by a decline in average interest rates earned on these balances. Interest expense increased $11.2 million to $82.7 million due to $500 million of new borrowings under our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the issuance of $1.25 billion of convertible senior notes in January 2008, offset in part by $150 million of principal reduction made on our $700 million term loan. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $628.7 million to a loss of $600.5 million, primarily as a result of losses related to liquidity fund support of approximately $607.3 million, which excludes $1.0 million of financing costs included in interest expense. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes decreased 56% to $176.0 million, primarily as a result of lower earnings due to losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of acquired management contract assets recorded during the current year. The effective tax rate increased to 39.7% from 38.1% in the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in earnings in higher state income tax rate jurisdictions as a result of the impairment and liquidity fund support charges at lower relative state income tax rates. 39 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income from Continuing Operations As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for cash income from continuing operations that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We define cash income from continuing operations as income from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets. We believe that cash income from continuing operations provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and it facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisition transactions. We also believe that cash income from continuing operations is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. In considering acquisitions, we often calculate a target firms cash earnings as a metric in estimating its value. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income from continuing operations is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider cash income from continuing operations to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value and because it facilitates comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense makes it difficult to compare our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we add them to income in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite life intangible assets or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income from continuing operations may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact on cash income from continuing operations to ensure appropriate explanations accompany disclosures of cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 40 Table of Contents A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, Period toPeriod Change 2008 2007 Income from Continuing Operations $ 267,610 $ 646,246 (58.6 )% Plus: Amortization of intangible assets 57,271 68,410 (16.3 ) Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 143,600 130,758 9.8 Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 468,481 $ 845,414 (44.6 ) Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 1.86 $ 4.48 (58.5 ) Amortization of intangible assets 0.40 0.47 (14.9 ) Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.99 0.91 8.8 Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 3.25 $ 5.86 (44.5 ) The decrease in cash income from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the impairment of management contracts, net of income tax benefits, of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted We believe that pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 4,634,086 $ 4,343,675 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 1,273,986 1,196,019 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 3,360,100 $ 3,147,656 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests $ 443,871 $ 1,043,854 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis 9.6 % 24.0 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted 13.2 33.2 41 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of management contracts reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0% and 3.3%, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1% and 4.5%, respectively. FISCAL 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2006 Since our strategic transaction with Citigroup was completed on December 1, 2005, in which we acquired the CAM business and sold the PC/CM businesses, we have retroactively reflected the results of operations of the PC/CM businesses as discontinued operations for fiscal 2006. Effective November 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the acquisitions, the results of our continuing operations for fiscal 2007 include a full year of results from CAM and Permal, while the results of continuing operations for fiscal 2006 include four months of results from CAM and five months of results from Permal. Assets Under Management AUM at March 31, 2007 were $968.5 billion, up $100.9 billion or 12% from March 31, 2006. Net client cash inflows for the fiscal year were $44.2 billion, representing 5% of our AUM at March 31, 2006, and were driven by approximately $27 billion of client inflows in both fixed income and liquidity assets, while client outflows in equity assets resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, were approximately $10 billion. We generally earn higher fees and profit margins on equity AUM and outflows in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues and net income.

Assets managed for non U.S. domiciled clients as of March 31, 2006 have been revised to include $19.3 billion of assets previously included as assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients, principally non U.S. domiciled funds. Revenue by Division Our operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2007 % ofTotal 2006(1) % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 2,444.4 56.3 $ 1,364.0 51.6 79.2 Institutional 970.0 22.3 717.6 27.1 35.2 Wealth Management 929.3 21.4 563.6 21.3 64.9 Total $ 4,343.7 100.0 $ 2,645.2 100.0 64.2 (1) Fiscal 2006 includes a reclassification of approximately $29.4 million and $4.6 million from the Institutional and Wealth Management divisions, respectively, to the Managed Investments division to reflect a change whereby the revenues generated by all proprietary funds, except those managed by Permal, are included in the Managed Investments division. The increases in operating revenues in the Managed Investments and Institutional divisions were primarily due to including a full years results of CAM. The increase in the operating revenues in the Wealth Management division was primarily due to including a full years results of Permal, including growth since acquisition, offset in part by decreases at PCM. The following discussion separately addresses the results of continuing operations and the results of our discontinued operations. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2007 were $4.3 billion, up 64% from $2.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of including a full years results of CAM and Permal, including Permals growth since acquisition, which combined accounted for approximately 90% of the increase in revenues. Higher average AUM, reflecting favorable market conditions and net client cash flows, also contributed to the increase. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 31% to $1.4 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisition of CAM, which accounted for approximately 80% of the increase, as well as higher AUM at Western Asset, Brandywine and LMCM, offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by PCM. 43 Table of Contents Investment advisory fees from funds increased 103% to $2.0 billion, with approximately 90% of the increase attributable to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal, including Permals growth since acquisition. Performance fees increased 40% to $142.2 million during fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of $31.9 million of increased fees earned by Permal. Distribution and service fees increased 68% to $716.4 million with approximately 75% of the increase due to the addition of fees earned by CAM. In addition, distribution and service fees from Permal contributed approximately 10% of the increase. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 39% to $1.6 billion, primarily as a result of the addition of compensation costs from the acquired businesses and increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our other subsidiaries. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 36.1% for the year ended March 31, 2007, down from 42.6%, primarily as a result of higher revenues at revenue share entities, including revenues transferred from acquired entities, which retain a lower percentage of revenues as compensation, and a decrease in transaction related compensation. Transaction related compensation costs primarily include recognition of previously deferred compensation for CAM employees under prior Citigroup plans and accruals for retention compensation for transitional CAM employees. Costs for severance at CAM are included in the purchase price allocation and are not reflected in our results of operations. Compensation as a percentage of revenues also decreased as a result of the significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 113% to $1.2 billion, with approximately 80% of the increase resulting from the addition of the acquired businesses. The majority of distribution and servicing expenses are paid to Citigroup, who is our primary distributor. Communications and technology, occupancy, amorti zation of intangible assets and other expenses all increased primarily as a result of a full year of expenses related to the CAM operations. The increase in other expenses was primarily from travel, professional fees and advertising costs. The litigation award settlement during fiscal 2006 reflects the reversal of $8.2 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2004 as a result of the settlement of a civil copyright infringement lawsuit. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $10.9 million to $58.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned on higher average firm investment account balances. Interest expense increased $18.8 million to $71.5 million primarily due to the impact of a full year of interest expense on a $700 million term loan issued to finance the acquisition of CAM, offset in part by the repayment at maturity of $100 million in senior notes during fiscal 2006 and the conversion of our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes to common stock. Other income decreased $12.3 million to $28.1 million as a result of investments held by variable interest entities (VIEs) that are no longer consolidated, offset in part by corresponding minority interests. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased 44.3% to $397.6 million, primarily as a result of the increase in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% from 38.5% in the prior year primarily reflecting increased revenues and earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates. Net income and diluted earnings per share declined 43%, to $646.8 million, and 49%, to $4.48, respectively, from the prior year as a result of the after tax gain on the sale of the PC/CM businesses of $644.0 million, or $4.94 per diluted share, recognized in the prior year. Income from continuing operations totaled $646.2 million, up 49% from the prior year and 44 Table of Contents income from continuing operations per diluted share increased 34% to $4.48 despite an 11% increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Cash income from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), rose 59% for the fiscal year to $845.4 million or $5.86 per diluted share from $532.1 million or $4.10 per diluted share primarily due to including a full years results of CAM and Permal. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 24.0% from 27.0% in the prior year, primarily as a result of the addition of a full years results of CAM and Permal. Increases in distribution revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense, and an increase in other non compensation related expenses were offset in part by decreases in compensation and benefits as a percent of revenue, due in part to higher revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our subsidiaries which retain a lower percentage of revenues as compensation, transaction related compensation, and other non operating income. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 33.2% from 34.3% in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in other non compensation related expenses and a decrease in non operating income, offset in part by reduced compensation and benefits, as a percent of total revenue, and transaction related compensation. In the year ended March 31, 2006, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $66.4 million and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51.

Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $0.6 million and $644.0 million, respectively. Gain on sale of discontinued operations had no impact on our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and was responsible for $4.94 per diluted share in fiscal 2006.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. During fiscal 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide approximately $2 billion in financial support to certain liquidity funds managed by our asset managers that had invested in asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by SIVs. These arrangements are described in the Liquidity Fund Support section below. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. In order to ensure adequate resources for the liquidity fund support transactions as well as for general corporate purposes, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased 46 Table of Contents under agreements to resell and investment advisory and related fees receivables. Our assets are principally funded by equity capital and long term debt. The investment advisory fee receivables are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds, governmental money market funds, commercial paper and repurchase agreements. The highly liquid nature of our current assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide approximately $2 billion in financial support to certain liquidity funds. As of March 31, 2008, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: Description TransactionDate SupportAmount CashCollateral(1) Letters of Credit(2) November 2007 $ 335,000 $ 286,250 Capital Support Agreement(3) November 2007 15,000 15,000 Purchase of Canadian Conduit Securities(4) December 2007 94,000 Total Return Swap(3) December 2007 890,000 139,480 Purchase of Non bank Sponsored SIVs(3,6) December 2007 82,000 Letter of Credit(5) March 2008 150,000 Capital Support Agreements(5) March 2008 400,000 400,000 Total $ 1,966,000 $ 840,730 (1) Included in current restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (2) Pertains to Citi Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C.

(USD Fund) (4) Pertains to the Legg Mason Western Asset Canadian Money Market Fund (5) Pertains to Citi Institutional Liquid Reserves Portfolio, a Series of Master Portfolio Trust (6) Securities issued by SIVs Letters of Credit In November 2007, we entered into arrangements with two large banks to provide letters of credit (LOCs) for an aggregate amount of approximately $335 million for the benefit of two liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support this agreement, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. On March 7, 2008, we elected to procure a LOC from a large bank to support another funds holdings in certain SIV issued securities. The March LOC provides support up to $150 million, which is further supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. Each of the LOCs may be drawn in certain circumstances, including upon the funds realizing a loss on disposition or restructuring of the underlying SIV securities, upon the agreements termination if unpaid amounts remain on the underlying securities, or in certain circumstances upon ratings downgrades of the issuing bank. In addition, the terms of the March LOC require that the fund sell the underlying securities if it continues to hold them at the LOCs expiration and draw on the LOC to make up for any losses on the sale. The LOCs will terminate no later than one year from the date of origination. Capital Support Agreements In November 2007, we entered into a capital support agreement (CSA) with one of the liquidity funds discussed above pursuant to which we have agreed to 47 Table of Contents provide up to $15 million in capital contributions to the fund if it recognizes losses from certain investments or continues to hold the underlying securities at the expiration of the one year term of the agreement and, at the applicable time, the funds net asset value is less than a specified threshold. On March 31, 2008, we also entered into CSAs with another fund under which we will make capital contributions if the fund realizes a loss on the sale of, or certain other events relating to, two SIV issued securities in the portfolio. We will make up to a maximum of $400 million of contributions to the fund under the March CSAs and have fully collateralized this obligation. The CSAs will terminate no later than one year from the date of origination, and the March CSA requires the fund to sell the securities at termination, if it still holds them, and utilize the CSA to cover any losses. Total Return Swap In December 2007, we reduced a Dublin domiciled fund holdings in SIV issued securities through the total return swap discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the total return swap, we will pay to the bank counterparty (the Bank) any losses (including losses incurred through a sale of the securities or through principal not being repaid at maturity) the Bank incurs from its ownership of the securities and a return on the purchase price paid for the underlying securities equal to the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, and the Bank will pay to us any principal and interest it receives on the securities in excess of the price it paid for the securities. The total return swap arrangement terminates in November 2008. However, we may elect to earlier terminate the total return swap arrangement at any time. The Bank may elect early termination of the total return swap arrangement in certain circumstances, including if an event has a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, if the credit ratings of our senior debt are reduced below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service or if we do not maintain, on a consolidated basis, at least $250 million in aggregate cash and cash equivalents plus amounts available to be borrowed under revolving credit facilities. Upon a termination of the total return swap arrangement, any outstanding securities will be sold at market prices and we will be responsible to reimburse the Bank for any losses the Bank incurs in the sale. The maximum future amount that we could be required to pay under the total return swap arrangement would be the aggregate price paid by the Bank for the securities of $832 million plus financing costs. In connection with the total return swap, we reimbursed the Dublin domiciled fund $59.5 million and provided $139.5 mil lion in cash collateral, which under the terms of the total return swap may be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. Purchase of Non bank Sponsored SIVs In December 2007, we purchased for cash an aggregate of $132 million in principal amount of non bank sponsored SIV securities from the same Dublin domiciled liquidity fund. During January 2008 and May 2008, approximately $50 million and $82 million, respectively, in principal amount of the securities matured and were paid in full. Purchase of Canadian Conduit Securities In December 2007, we acquired for cash an aggregate of $98 million in principal amount of conduit securities issued by Canadian asset backed commercial paper issuers to provide liquidity support to a Canadian liquidity fund. As the LOCs, CSAs and total return swap expire over the coming ten months, we may be required to provide substantial amounts to the funds and the banks if they still hold the underlying securities at the expiration time. We may elect to provide additional credit or other support to liquidity funds managed by our subsidiaries, if we deem this action necessary and appropriate in the future. If we do so, we may be required to use additional cash to pay for the support or as collateral. The pledge of cash and the investment in the funds restrict our ability to use the cash for other purposes and, together with any future uses of cash to provide additional support, reduce our flexibility to use these assets for other corporate purposes, including debt repayments, stock repurchases and acquisitions. 48 Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2008: Type FaceAmount Amount Outstanding at March 31, Interest Rate Maturity 2008 2007 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 $ 2.50% January 2015 Revolving Credit Agreement(1) 1,000,000 500,000 LIBOR + 0.60% October 2010 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 650,000 LIBOR + 0.60% October 2010 6.75% Senior Notes 425,000 424,959 424,796 6.75% July 2008 (1) $150 million of the available $500 million is reserved in connection with the LOC for the same amount to support certain SIV issued holdings by proprietary liquidity funds. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet by providing additional liquidity that will be used for general corporate purposes, including support for key business initiatives such as potential future acquisitions and to purchase and then retire convertible preferred stock. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. This transaction closed on January 31, 2008. We used approximately $180 million of the capital raised to purchase and retire preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. This facility matures on October 14, 2010, may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. On January 3, 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 7, 2008, we elected to procure a LOC to support up to $150 million of certain SIV issued holdings in a liquidity fund under this facility. See previous discussion on liquidity fund support. Included in outstanding debt is $425 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The $425 million principal amount of senior notes was reclassified to the current portion of long term debt during the September 2007 quarter. The accreted balance at March 31, 2008 was $425 million. During fiscal 2006, holders of zero coupon contingent convertible notes aggregating $480 million principal amount at maturity converted the notes into approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock. During fiscal 2007, all remaining outstanding zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes were converted into 756 thousand shares of common stock. In May 2008, we issued $1.15 billion of Equity Units, each unit consisting of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of senior notes due June 30, 2021, with interest payable quarterly at the annual rate of 5.6% and a purchase contract committing the holder to purchase shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% and are required to pledge their interests in senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include support of liquidity funds managed by its subsidiaries, financing acquisitions and repayment of outstanding debt. During the December 2007 quarter, both Fitch Ratings and Moodys Investors Service changed their outlook on our senior unsecured debt to negative from stable as a 49 Table of Contents result of the firms support of its liquidity funds. In April 2008, Standard and Poors Rating Services revised the outlook on its rating on Legg Mason to stable from positive. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2008 for Moodys Investors Service, Standard and Poors Rating Services and Fitch Ratings were A2, BBB+ and A, respectively. On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of CAM in exchange for (i) all outstanding stock of our subsidiaries that constituted our PC/CM businesses; (ii) 5,393,545 shares of common stock and 13.346632 shares of our non voting convertible preferred stock, which is convertible, upon transfer, into 13,346,632 shares of common stock; and (iii) $512 million in cash borrowed under a $700 million five year syndicated term loan facility. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a post closing purchase price adjustment of $84.7 million to Citigroup in September 2006, based on the retention of certain AUM nine months after the closing. Since this contingent payment was paid from available cash, an unsecured 5 year, $300 million floating rate credit agreement that we had entered to fund this obligation terminated in accordance with its terms. During fiscal 2008 and 2006, we issued approximately 5.53 million and 4.96 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately 5.53 and 4.96 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the CAM acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash. On October 14, 2005, we entered into a syndicated five year $700 million unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. At closing, we borrowed $600 million, of which $512 million was used to fund the cash portion of the purchase and the remainder was used to fund acquisition related expenses. The remaining $100 million of the $700 million loan facility was drawn down in February 2006 for additional acquisition related costs. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap (Swap) to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this Swap began to unwind and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The outstanding balance under this facility was $550 million at March 31, 2008 and the remaining unamortized balance of the Swap was $150 million. Also in connection with the Citigroup transaction, one of our subsidiaries was the borrower under a 364 day promissory note of $83.2 million. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we paid from available cash the balance outstanding on this note. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We have the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right is not exercised, the holders of those equity interests have the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The aggregate consideration paid by us at closing was $800 million, of which $200 million was in the form of 1,889,322 newly issued shares of our common stock and the remainder was cash. We funded the cash portion of the acquisition from existing cash. In accordance with the terms of the transaction, we acquired preference shares representing an additional 7.5% ownership interest in Permal during the December 31, 2007 quarter, and it is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining 12.5% four years after the initial closing at prices based on Permals revenues. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, with a $961 million minimum price, excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, contingent acquisition payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, of which 50 Table of Contents $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in common stock. The remaining minimum obligation of $81 million as of March 31, 2008 is payable in November 2011, unless earned earlier. The agreements provide for additional consideration of up to $265 million based on Permals future revenues and earnings. We may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2008 and 2007, we paid approximately $12 million in each period in dividends on the preference shares, and we will pay a minimum of $15 million in dividends on the preference shares over the next 2 years. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to replenish funds used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million, which was accrued as a liability with a corresponding increase to goodwill at March 31, 2006. This payment is subject to certain limited claw back provisions through fiscal 2010. On February 26, 2008, we announced a definitive agreement in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, would acquire a majority of the overlay and implementation business of Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group, which includes its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale closed on April 1, 2008 and cash proceeds of approximately $181 million were received. At March 31, 2008, our total assets and stockholders equity were $11.8 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. During fiscal 2008, stockholders equity increased approximately $79.0 million, primarily due to net income and stock option exercises, offset by share repurchases and dividend payments. During the year ended March 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents increased by $279.9 million from $1.18 billion at March 31, 2007 to $1.46 billion at March 31, 2008. This excludes $604.6 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell and $851.7 million of restricted cash. Cash flows from operating activities provided $964.4 million, primarily attributable to net income, adjusted for non cash items and purchases of trading securities. Cash flows from investing activities used $1.9 billion, primarily attributable to funding restricted cash related to liquidity fund support transactions discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Permal contractual acquisition payment and payments for leasehold improvements for office relocations. Financing activities provided $1.2 billion, primarily due to proceeds from issuance of 2.5% convertible senior notes and short term borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, offset in part by dividend payments, repayment of principal on long term debt and common and preferred stock repurchases. In addition to the $1.15 billion Equity Units discussed above, we expect that cash flows provided by operating activities and cash on hand will be the primary sources of working capital for the next year. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors previously authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. On July 19, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4 million shares of common stock from the proceeds from the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and 51 Table of Contents retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2007 and 2006. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid cash dividends of $132.8 million, $109.9 million, and $78.6 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Special Purpose and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support in Notes 1, 17, and 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements include letters of credit, capital support agreements and a total return swap, which are fully described above and in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we have made or expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 7, 8, and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations at March 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings $ 500.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 500.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 432.2 7.0 555.6 4.4 0.9 1,257.7 2,257.8 Coupon interest on short term and long term borrowings(1) 79.7 47.1 43.2 31.8 31.7 63.6 297.1 Minimum rental and service commitments 128.9 121.2 94.7 89.5 85.0 640.1 1,159.4 Minimum commitments under capital leases(2) 31.3 2.3 2.4 0.2 36.2 Total Contractual Obligations 1,172.1 177.6 695.9 125.9 117.6 1,961.4 4,250.5 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(3) 7.5 293.5 60.0 361.0 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(4,5,6) $ 1,179.6 $ 471.1 $ 695.9 $ 185.9 $ 117.6 $ 1,961.4 $ 4,611.5 (1) Coupon interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2008.

(3) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (4) The table above does not include approximately $50.6 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2009 to 2011. (5) The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $21.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. (6) The table above does not include our obligations under the $485 million in letters of credit, the $415 million in capital support agreements or the total return swap of $890 million. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments. Restructuring Charges In connection with the CAM transaction, we incurred costs of restructuring the business of the combined entities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. MARKET RISK A risk management committee oversees and coordinates risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. In addition, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM and underperformance of advisory contracts versus the applicable performance benchmarks 53 Table of Contents will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. We have entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds beginning in November 2007. These arrangements include letters of credit, capital support agreements and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increase our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. These fund support arrangements and the related risks are discussed below. Trading assets at March 31, 2008 and 2007 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2008 2007 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 207,305 $ 191,684 Proprietary fund product and other investments 140,267 81,482 Securities issued by SIVs 141,509 Total trading investments $ 489,081 $ 273,166 Approximately $169.8 million and $153.7 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income. Other trading investments of $37.5 million and $38.0 million at March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our non operating income and net income. Approximately $140.3 million and $81.5 million of trading assets at March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments in which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income and net income. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record or has other investors. The remaining trading assets include $141.5 million at March 31, 2008 in investments issued by SIVs acquired from liquidity funds our subsidiary manages, of which $82.0 million matured and was paid in full in May 2008. The fair value of these trading assets will also fluctuate with market changes and will impact our non operating income and net income. 54 Table of Contents Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2008 and 2007 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2008 2007 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 7,700 $ 8,297 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 81,703 58,265 Other investments 1,323 1,298 Total non trading investments 90,726 67,860 Derivative assets: Total return swap 45,706 Total non trading assets $ 136,432 $ 67,860 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ 551,654 $ Fluctuations in the market value of these non trading assets and the underlying securities of the non trading derivative assets and liabilities will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. While we have a derivative asset on the total return swap of $45.7 million at March 31, 2008, this arrangement covers an aggregate of $890 million in principal of SIV issued securities, substantially all of which is at risk, along with related financing costs. Also, in addition to recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $551.7 million at March 31, 2008, these arrangements collectively cover an aggregate of $3.4 billion in principal of SIV issued securities, for which our exposure is limited to approximately $900 million. Accordingly, these fund support arrangements currently expose us to $348.3 million of additional potential losses on SIV issued securities held by funds managed by a subsidiary. The total return swap and other fund support arrangements all have one year terms that expire no later than March 2009. See Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Australia, may impact our comprehensive and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. In addition, a portion of our outstanding floating rate debt is hedged through an interest rate swap that reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $911 million and $312 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is not hedged such that fluctuations in interest rates will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. The total return swap, under which we have recorded a derivative asset of $45.7 million at March 31, 2008, includes certain payment provisions based on LIBOR rates, such that fluctuation in interest rates will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 55 Table of Contents reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for other than temporary impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. In fiscal 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualify as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments are based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. As of March 31, 2008, we had $45.7 million of derivative assets included in Other current assets and $551.7 million of derivative liabilities included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exposure on these derivative instruments is based on the underlying securities values and related gains and losses may vary significantly in relation to their recorded balances. None of these derivative transactions are designated for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Other non operating income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income in fiscal 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we owned approximately $156.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, we also have approximately $81.7 million and $58.3 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), to provide a consistent definition of fair value and establish a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 has additional disclosure requirements and will be effective for fiscal 2009. The disclosure requirements include a classification of fair value measurements impacting an entitys financial statements among a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair values into three broad levels, where 56 Table of Contents measurements for Level 1 are based on quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 are based on direct or indirect observable inputs and Level 3 are based on unobservable inputs, including managements estimates. The provisions of SFAS 157 for recurring fair value measurements will be adopted by us during fiscal 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on fair value measurements in our consolidated financial statements. It is estimated that less than 3% of total assets and approximately 11% of total liabilities will meet the definition of Level 3, where fair values are based on unobservable inputs, including managements estimates. As a result, the fair values of these Level 3 assets and liabilities are potentially subject to more significant fluctuations in amounts ultimately realized. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately $2.5 billion in goodwill, $3.9 billion in indefinite life intangible assets and $237.7 million in net amortizable intangible assets. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to 15 years. As of March 31, 2008, amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of 8 years. Goodwill is evaluated quarterly at the reporting unit level and is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Managed Investments, Institutional and Wealth Management divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of goodwill under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. The Wealth Management and Managed Investments reporting units represent approximately 56% and 40%, respectively, of our goodwill. Wealth Management goodwill is principally attributable to PCM; Managed Investments goodwill is principally attributable to the CAM acquisition. Projected cash flows for these divisions are assumed to grow 10% annually over the 57 Table of Contents next five years, with a long term annual growth rate of 5%. The projected cash flows are discounted at 12% to determine the present value. The discount rate is based on an estimated average risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital. For the Wealth Management reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to decline by more than 54% or the discount rate would have to increase to more than 19% for the goodwill to be deemed impaired. For the Managed Investments reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to decline by more than 49% or the discount rate would have to increase to more than 18% for the goodwill to be deemed impaired. We review the fair value of our intangible assets on a quarterly basis, considering projected cash flows, to determine whether the assets are impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current implied fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. The implied fair values of intangible assets subject to amortization are determined at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the estimated remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. Management contract intangible assets related to the retail separately managed accounts acquired in the CAM acquisition and client contracts acquired in the 2001 acquisition of PCM represent approximately 59% and 15%, respectively, of our total amortizable intangible assets. The CAM intangible asset has an original expected life of 12 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 8%), with 9.7 years remaining. For CAM contracts to be impaired, cash flows would have to decline by approximately 59% or client attrition would have to increase sufficiently to decrease the remaining estimated life by more than 41%. The PCM intangible asset related to acquired client contracts had an original expected life of 18 years (which represents an annual contract attrition rate of 6%). During fiscal 2008, acquired client contracts and related assets under management declined significantly. Based on revised attrition estimates, the remaining useful lives were decreased to periods from one to five years at March 31, 2008. As a result of significant recent client attrition, declines in assets under management and revised estimate of remaining useful lives, the evaluation at March 31, 2008 indicated the amortized carrying value of $188 million would not be fully recoverable. Projected cash flows on remaining acquired contracts, discounted at a rate of 12%, indicated a remaining value of $37 million, and an impairment charge of $151 million on the PCM management contracts was recorded in the March 2008 quarter. At the current assumed client attrition rates, the cash flows generated by the underlying management contracts held by PCM would have to decline by approximately 35% for the asset to become further impaired. Similarly, with no change to the profitability of the contracts, client attrition would have to accelerate to a rate such that our remaining estimated useful life would decline by approximately 49% before the asset would be deemed impaired. For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent, trade names. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of proprietary fund contracts include the projected cash flows generated by those contracts and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows 58 Table of Contents for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth approximating market returns. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the CAM acquisition and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts account for approximately 65% and 24%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. Cash flows from the CAM and Permal contracts are assumed to grow at long term annual rates of 5% and 8%, respectively, which approximates the expected average market returns. The projected cash flows from the CAM and Permal funds are discounted at 12%. Changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in impairment. At current profitability levels, cash flows generated by the CAM mutual fund contracts would have to fall approximately 27% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised to 15% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Likewise, cash flows generated by the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to decline by approximately 76% or the discount rate increased to 28% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Trade names account for 3% of indefinite life intangible assets, approximately one third of which relates to PCM. Unlike PCMs management contracts, the recovery of trade name value considers all of PCMs cash flows, not just the acquired client contracts. At current profitability levels and an estimated 8% long term growth rate, cash flows generated by PCM would have to fall approximately 9% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised from 12.0% to 12.4% for the trade name to be considered for impairment. However, since trade names are considered to have an indefinite life, we continue to evaluate trade names with a long term view when determining impairment. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM, Royce and Permal involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Historically, contingent payments have been recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue stock options to officers, key employees and non employee members of our Board of Directors. During fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment and related pronouncements using the modified prospective method and the related transition election. Under this method, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. As further described below, we determine the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model, with the exception of market based performance grants, which are valued with a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Prior to fiscal 2007, awards were also accounted for at grant date fair value, except for awards granted prior to April 1, 2003, that were recorded at their intrinsic value. As a result, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), no related compensation expense was recognized for the awards granted prior to April 1, 2003, and the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the 59 Table of Contents determination of net income for fiscal 2006 is less than that which would have been included if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Under the modified prospective method, the results for the year ended March 31, 2006 have not been restated. Additionally, unamortized deferred compensation previously classified as a separate component of stockholders equity has been reclassified as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under SFAS No. 123 (R), cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2008. For the year ended March 31, 2006, such amount was $92,376, and continues to be classified as operating cash inflows. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), we provide disclosure in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our pro forma results if compensation expense associated with all stock option grants had been recognized at grant date fair value over their respective vesting period. If we accounted for prior years stock option grants at grant date fair value, net income from continuing operations would have been reduced by $3.2 million in fiscal 2006, respectively. Net income from discontinued operations would have been reduced by $4.0 million in fiscal 2006. These reductions are the result of including additional expenses for grants made prior to April 2003. We granted 933,000, 1,037,380, and 1,101,105 stock options, including grants to non employee directors, in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for performance or market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility in part based upon the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the Federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we 60 Table of Contents determine that our estimates have changed, the income tax provision will be adjusted in the period in which that determination is made. During fiscal 2008, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), that prescribes recognition and measurement thresholds in financial statements for tax positions. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding income taxes. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases can be, may be, expects, may affect, may depend, believes, estimate, project, anticipate and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. 61 Table of Contents Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible and goodwill values.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise Legg Mason) is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, with three divisions: Managed Investments, Institutional, and Wealth Management. Managed Investments is primarily engaged in providing investment advisory services to proprietary investment funds or to retail separately managed account programs. Institutional focuses on providing asset management services to institutional clients. Wealth Management is primarily focused on providing asset management services to high net worth individuals and families and endowments and includes our funds of hedge funds business. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the aggregation of operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. 33 Table of Contents Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the past decade, we have experienced substantial expansion due to internal growth and the strategic acquisition of asset management firms that provided, among other things, a broader range of investment expertise, additional product diversification and increased assets under management. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been affected by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes in the post Enron era. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. During much of fiscal 2008, and continuing thereafter, the fixed income markets have endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles (SIVs) became substantially reduced. As a result, we entered into several transactions during the fiscal year to provide support to liquidity funds that are managed by our asset managers that had invested in SIV issued securities. These transactions resulted in aggregate charges during fiscal year 2008 of $608.3 million ($313.7 million, net of income taxes and compensation related adjustments). On December 1, 2005, we completed a strategic acquisition to become a pure asset management company in which we transferred our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses (PC/CM) to Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) as a portion of the consideration in exchange for substantially all of Citigroups asset management business (CAM). Prior to the closing of this transaction, we reported the PC/CM businesses as separate business segments. However, both businesses are now included in discontinued operations for fiscal 2006 as described below. Effective November 1, 2005, we also purchased Permal Group Ltd (Permal), a leading global funds of hedge funds manager, to expand our global asset management business. See Notes 2 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction with Citigroup and the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the sale of our PC/CM businesses to Citigroup, distribution fees earned on company sponsored investment funds are reported in continuing operations as distribution fee revenue, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties, including parties that were related prior to the sale, as distribution and servicing expense. All periods presented reflect this change. Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of the PC/CM businesses in fiscal 2006, the results of the Private Client and Capital Markets segments are reflected in discontinued operations. Private Client distributed a wide range of financial products through its branch distribution network, including equity and fixed income securities, proprietary and non affiliated mutual funds and annuities. The primary sources of net revenues for Private Client were 34 Table of Contents commissions and principal credits earned on equity and fixed income transactions in customer brokerage accounts, distribution fees earned from mutual funds, fee based account fees and net interest from customers margin loan and credit account balances. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings initiated in the Capital Markets segment were reported in Private Client when sold through its branch distribution network. Capital Markets consisted of our equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading and corporate and public finance. The primary sources of revenue for equity and fixed income institutional sales and trading included commissions and principal credits on transactions in both corporate and municipal products. We maintained proprietary fixed income and equity securities inventories primarily to facilitate customer transactions and as a result recognized trading profits and losses from our trading activities. Corporate finance revenues included underwriting fees and advisory fees from private placements and mergers and acquisitions. Sales credits associated with underwritten offerings were reported in Capital Markets when sold through institutional distribution channels. The results of this business segment also included realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments acquired in connection with merchant and investment banking activities. All references to fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as we, us, our, and company refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States was volatile during fiscal 2008 and challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year. Continued contraction in worldwide credit markets due in part to sub prime lending issues, which began in the summer of 2007, a weaker U.S. dollar, major write downs related to the credit crisis within the financial sector, and record high oil prices continued to concern investors about the state of the U.S. and global economies. As a result, all three major U.S. equity market indices declined during the fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,(1) NASDAQ Composite Index(2) and the S&P 500(3) were down 1%, 6% and 7%, respectively, for the fiscal year. In addition, during fiscal 2008 the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to 2.25% at March 31, 2008, down from 5.25% a year ago in an effort to ease the impact of the credit crisis. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2009. We expect the challenges presented by the credit markets to persist throughout the next fiscal year. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. (1) Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

These transactions resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $608.3 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, an impairment charge of $151.0 million was recorded for a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 totaled $267.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, a decrease of 59% and 58%, respectively, from the prior year. Cash income from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $468.5 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, both representing a decrease of 45% from the prior year. These decreases were primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the impairment charge, net of income tax benefits, of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 9.6% from 24.0% in the prior year. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 13.2% from 33.2% in the prior year. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0% and 3.3%, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1% and 4.5%, respectively. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management (AUM) (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 2007 Beginning of period $ 968.5 $ 867.6 Net client cash flows (26.3 ) 44.2 Market performance and other 9.9 57.5 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (2.0 ) (0.8 ) End of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 AUM at March 31, 2008 were $950.1 billion, a decrease of $18.4 billion or 2% from March 31, 2007. Net client cash outflows for the fiscal year were $26.3 billion and were driven by outflows in equity assets of approximately $44 billion, resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, partially offset by approximately $15 billion and $3 billion of fixed income and liquidity inflows, respectively. Due in part to investment performance, we have experienced net equity outflows in each quarter since the September 2006 quarter. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Equity $ 271.6 28.6 $ 338.0 34.9 (19.6 ) Fixed Income 508.2 53.5 470.9 48.6 7.9 Liquidity 170.3 17.9 159.6 16.5 6.7 Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % ofTotal 2007 % ofTotal %Change Equity $ 327.6 33.1 $ 325.1 35.9 0.8 Fixed Income 498.6 50.3 441.9 48.8 12.8 Liquidity 163.9 16.6 138.8 15.3 18.1 Total $ 990.1 100.0 $ 905.8 100.0 9.3 AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % ofTotal 2007 % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 376.6 39.7 $ 403.2 41.6 (6.6 ) Institutional 511.4 53.8 496.3 51.3 3.0 Wealth Management 62.1 6.5 69.0 7.1 (10.0 ) Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) 37 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2008 were as follows: ManagedInvestments Institutional WealthManagement TotalAUM March 31, 2007 $ 403.2 $ 496.3 $ 69.0 $ 968.5 Net client cash flows (23.2 ) 2.5 (5.6 ) (26.3 ) Market performance and other (2.7 ) 12.6 9.9 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (0.7 ) (1.3 ) (2.0 ) March 31, 2008 $ 376.6 $ 511.4 $ 62.1 $ 950.1 Assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients accounted for 66% and 67% of total assets managed and non U.S. domiciled clients represented 34% and 33% of total assets managed as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % ofTotal 2007 % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 2,538.4 54.8 $ 2,444.4 56.3 3.8 Institutional 1,024.5 22.1 970.0 22.3 5.6 Wealth Management 1,071.2 23.1 929.3 21.4 15.3 Total $ 4,634.1 100.0 $ 4,343.7 100.0 6.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Managed Investments division was primarily due to increased mutual fund revenues at Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset) and Royce & Associates, LLC (Royce), partially offset by decreased mutual fund revenues at ClearBridge Advisors LLC (ClearBridge). The increase in operating revenues in the Institutional division was primarily due to increased separate account revenues at Western Asset and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC (Brandywine), partially offset by decreased performance fees at Western Asset. The increase in operating revenues in the Wealth Management division was primarily due to increased revenues, distribution and service fees and performance fees at Permal, partially offset by decreased separate account revenues at Private Capital Management, LP (PCM). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2008 were $4.6 billion, up 7% from $4.3 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 9% increase in average AUM, principally in the liquidity and fixed income asset classes. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 1%, or $18.7 million, to $1.46 billion, primarily as a result of higher average assets managed by Western Asset, Brandywine and Batterymarch Financial Management Inc., offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by PCM and ClearBridge. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 15% to $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets managed by Permal, Western Asset and Royce. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average assets managed by ClearBridge. Performance fees decreased 7%, or $9.5 million, to $132.7 million during fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of decreases in performance fees earned by Western Asset, and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. (LMCM), which were partially offset by an increase in performance fees earned by Permal. 38 Table of Contents Distribution and service fees decreased 3% to $692.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic equity funds. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits remained flat at $1.6 billion, as increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues along with higher salary and benefits at certain of our subsidiaries were substantially offset by incentive expense reductions related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that hold SIV issued securities. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges related to our liquidity business. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 33.9% for fiscal 2008, down from 36.1% for fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of a reduction in compensation resulting from adjustments related to liquidity fund support. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 7% to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased average AUM at Permal and in liquidity assets for which we pay higher relative fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense increased 11% to $192.8 million, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense, technology maintenance, and other expenditures related to investment management and business continuity infrastructure and office relocations. Occupancy expense increased 29% to $129.4 million, primarily as a result of higher rent at new office locations and the impact of duplicate rent on facilities during relocation periods. Expense for impairment of management contracts was $151.0 million, representing the write down of certain acquired management contracts as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition than previously estimated. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of management contracts. Other operating expenses increased 1% to $209.9 million, driven primarily by increased promotional expenses, offset in part by decreased expenses under a transition services agreement with Citigroup related to the integration of businesses acquired from Citigroup and prior year losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets as a result of office relocations. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $18.0 million to $76.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average firm investment account balances, offset in part by a decline in average interest rates earned on these balances. Interest expense increased $11.2 million to $82.7 million due to $500 million of new borrowings under our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the issuance of $1.25 billion of convertible senior notes in January 2008, offset in part by $150 million of principal reduction made on our $700 million term loan. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $628.7 million to a loss of $600.5 million, primarily as a result of losses related to liquidity fund support of approximately $607.3 million, which excludes $1.0 million of financing costs included in interest expense. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes decreased 56% to $176.0 million, primarily as a result of lower earnings due to losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of acquired management contract assets recorded during the current year. The effective tax rate increased to 39.7% from 38.1% in the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in earnings in higher state income tax rate jurisdictions as a result of the impairment and liquidity fund support charges at lower relative state income tax rates. 39 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income from Continuing Operations As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for cash income from continuing operations that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We define cash income from continuing operations as income from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets. We believe that cash income from continuing operations provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and it facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisition transactions. We also believe that cash income from continuing operations is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. In considering acquisitions, we often calculate a target firms cash earnings as a metric in estimating its value. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income from continuing operations is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider cash income from continuing operations to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value and because it facilitates comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense makes it difficult to compare our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we add them to income in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite life intangible assets or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income from continuing operations may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact on cash income from continuing operations to ensure appropriate explanations accompany disclosures of cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 40 Table of Contents A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, Period toPeriod Change 2008 2007 Income from Continuing Operations $ 267,610 $ 646,246 (58.6 )% Plus: Amortization of intangible assets 57,271 68,410 (16.3 ) Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 143,600 130,758 9.8 Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 468,481 $ 845,414 (44.6 ) Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 1.86 $ 4.48 (58.5 ) Amortization of intangible assets 0.40 0.47 (14.9 ) Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.99 0.91 8.8 Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 3.25 $ 5.86 (44.5 ) The decrease in cash income from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the impairment of management contracts, net of income tax benefits, of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted We believe that pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 4,634,086 $ 4,343,675 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 1,273,986 1,196,019 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 3,360,100 $ 3,147,656 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests $ 443,871 $ 1,043,854 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis 9.6 % 24.0 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted 13.2 33.2 41 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of management contracts reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0% and 3.3%, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1% and 4.5%, respectively. FISCAL 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2006 Since our strategic transaction with Citigroup was completed on December 1, 2005, in which we acquired the CAM business and sold the PC/CM businesses, we have retroactively reflected the results of operations of the PC/CM businesses as discontinued operations for fiscal 2006. Effective November 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Permal. As a result of the acquisitions, the results of our continuing operations for fiscal 2007 include a full year of results from CAM and Permal, while the results of continuing operations for fiscal 2006 include four months of results from CAM and five months of results from Permal. Assets Under Management AUM at March 31, 2007 were $968.5 billion, up $100.9 billion or 12% from March 31, 2006. Net client cash inflows for the fiscal year were $44.2 billion, representing 5% of our AUM at March 31, 2006, and were driven by approximately $27 billion of client inflows in both fixed income and liquidity assets, while client outflows in equity assets resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, were approximately $10 billion. We generally earn higher fees and profit margins on equity AUM and outflows in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues and net income. The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2007 2006 Beginning of period $ 867.6 $ 374.5 Net client cash flows 44.2 35.6 Market performance and other 57.5 36.9 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (0.8) 420.6 End of period $968.5 $867.6 Average AUM for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were $905.8 billion and $546.9 billion, respectively. The significant increase was due to the impact of a full year of the CAM acquisition. Our AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2007 % ofTotal 2006 % ofTotal %Change Equity $ 338.0 34.9 $ 324.9 37.5 4.0 Fixed Income 470.9 48.6 410.6 47.3 14.7 Liquidity 159.6 16.5 132.1 15.2 20.8 Total $ 968.5 100.0 $ 867.6 100.0 11.6 Our AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2007 % ofTotal 2006 % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 403.2 41.6 $ 356.5 41.1 13.1 Institutional 496.3 51.3 444.8 51.3 11.6 Wealth Management 69.0 7.1 66.3 7.6 4.1 Total $ 968.5 100.0 $ 867.6 100.0 11.6 42 Table of Contents The components of the changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the years ended March 31, 2007 were as follows: ManagedInvestments Institutional WealthManagement TotalAUM March 31, 2006 $ 356.5 $ 444.8 $ 66.3 $ 867.6 Net client cash flows 23.5 21.7 (1.0 ) 44.2 Market performance and other 23.3 30.2 4.0 57.5 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (0.1 ) (0.4 ) (0.3 ) (0.8 ) March 31, 2007 $ 403.2 $ 496.3 $ 69.0 $ 968.5 Assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients accounted for 67% and 68% of total assets managed and non U.S. domiciled clients represented 33% and 32% of total assets managed as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Assets managed for non U.S. domiciled clients as of March 31, 2006 have been revised to include $19.3 billion of assets previously included as assets managed for U.S. domiciled clients, principally non U.S. domiciled funds. Revenue by Division Our operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2007 % ofTotal 2006(1) % ofTotal %Change Managed Investments $ 2,444.4 56.3 $ 1,364.0 51.6 79.2 Institutional 970.0 22.3 717.6 27.1 35.2 Wealth Management 929.3 21.4 563.6 21.3 64.9 Total $ 4,343.7 100.0 $ 2,645.2 100.0 64.2 (1) Fiscal 2006 includes a reclassification of approximately $29.4 million and $4.6 million from the Institutional and Wealth Management divisions, respectively, to the Managed Investments division to reflect a change whereby the revenues generated by all proprietary funds, except those managed by Permal, are included in the Managed Investments division. The increases in operating revenues in the Managed Investments and Institutional divisions were primarily due to including a full years results of CAM. The increase in the operating revenues in the Wealth Management division was primarily due to including a full years results of Permal, including growth since acquisition, offset in part by decreases at PCM. The following discussion separately addresses the results of continuing operations and the results of our discontinued operations. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2007 were $4.3 billion, up 64% from $2.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of including a full years results of CAM and Permal, including Permals growth since acquisition, which combined accounted for approximately 90% of the increase in revenues. Higher average AUM, reflecting favorable market conditions and net client cash flows, also contributed to the increase. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 31% to $1.4 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisition of CAM, which accounted for approximately 80% of the increase, as well as higher AUM at Western Asset, Brandywine and LMCM, offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by PCM. 43 Table of Contents Investment advisory fees from funds increased 103% to $2.0 billion, with approximately 90% of the increase attributable to the acquisitions of CAM and Permal, including Permals growth since acquisition. Performance fees increased 40% to $142.2 million during fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of $31.9 million of increased fees earned by Permal. Distribution and service fees increased 68% to $716.4 million with approximately 75% of the increase due to the addition of fees earned by CAM. In addition, distribution and service fees from Permal contributed approximately 10% of the increase. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits increased 39% to $1.6 billion, primarily as a result of the addition of compensation costs from the acquired businesses and increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our other subsidiaries. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 36.1% for the year ended March 31, 2007, down from 42.6%, primarily as a result of higher revenues at revenue share entities, including revenues transferred from acquired entities, which retain a lower percentage of revenues as compensation, and a decrease in transaction related compensation. Transaction related compensation costs primarily include recognition of previously deferred compensation for CAM employees under prior Citigroup plans and accruals for retention compensation for transitional CAM employees. Costs for severance at CAM are included in the purchase price allocation and are not reflected in our results of operations. Compensation as a percentage of revenues also decreased as a result of the significant increase in fund revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 113% to $1.2 billion, with approximately 80% of the increase resulting from the addition of the acquired businesses. The majority of distribution and servicing expenses are paid to Citigroup, who is our primary distributor. Communications and technology, occupancy, amorti zation of intangible assets and other expenses all increased primarily as a result of a full year of expenses related to the CAM operations. The increase in other expenses was primarily from travel, professional fees and advertising costs. The litigation award settlement during fiscal 2006 reflects the reversal of $8.2 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2004 as a result of the settlement of a civil copyright infringement lawsuit. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $10.9 million to $58.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned on higher average firm investment account balances. Interest expense increased $18.8 million to $71.5 million primarily due to the impact of a full year of interest expense on a $700 million term loan issued to finance the acquisition of CAM, offset in part by the repayment at maturity of $100 million in senior notes during fiscal 2006 and the conversion of our zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes to common stock. Other income decreased $12.3 million to $28.1 million as a result of investments held by variable interest entities (VIEs) that are no longer consolidated, offset in part by corresponding minority interests. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased 44.3% to $397.6 million, primarily as a result of the increase in income from continuing operations. The effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% from 38.5% in the prior year primarily reflecting increased revenues and earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates. Net income and diluted earnings per share declined 43%, to $646.8 million, and 49%, to $4.48, respectively, from the prior year as a result of the after tax gain on the sale of the PC/CM businesses of $644.0 million, or $4.94 per diluted share, recognized in the prior year. Income from continuing operations totaled $646.2 million, up 49% from the prior year and 44 Table of Contents income from continuing operations per diluted share increased 34% to $4.48 despite an 11% increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Cash income from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), rose 59% for the fiscal year to $845.4 million or $5.86 per diluted share from $532.1 million or $4.10 per diluted share primarily due to including a full years results of CAM and Permal. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 24.0% from 27.0% in the prior year, primarily as a result of the addition of a full years results of CAM and Permal. Increases in distribution revenues, of which a substantial portion is passed through to third parties as distribution and servicing expense, and an increase in other non compensation related expenses were offset in part by decreases in compensation and benefits as a percent of revenue, due in part to higher revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues at certain of our subsidiaries which retain a lower percentage of revenues as compensation, transaction related compensation, and other non operating income. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 33.2% from 34.3% in the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in other non compensation related expenses and a decrease in non operating income, offset in part by reduced compensation and benefits, as a percent of total revenue, and transaction related compensation. In the year ended March 31, 2006, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, totaled $66.4 million and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.51.

Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $0.6 million and $644.0 million, respectively. Gain on sale of discontinued operations had no impact on our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and was responsible for $4.94 per diluted share in fiscal 2006.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. During fiscal 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide approximately $2 billion in financial support to certain liquidity funds managed by our asset managers that had invested in asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by SIVs. These arrangements are described in the Liquidity Fund Support section below. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. In order to ensure adequate resources for the liquidity fund support transactions as well as for general corporate purposes, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased 46 Table of Contents under agreements to resell and investment advisory and related fees receivables. Our assets are principally funded by equity capital and long term debt. The investment advisory fee receivables are short term in nature and collectibility is reasonably certain. Excess cash is generally invested in institutional money market funds, governmental money market funds, commercial paper and repurchase agreements. The highly liquid nature of our current assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our anticipated operating needs. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide approximately $2 billion in financial support to certain liquidity funds. As of March 31, 2008, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: Description TransactionDate SupportAmount CashCollateral(1) Letters of Credit(2) November 2007 $ 335,000 $ 286,250 Capital Support Agreement(3) November 2007 15,000 15,000 Purchase of Canadian Conduit Securities(4) December 2007 94,000 Total Return Swap(3) December 2007 890,000 139,480 Purchase of Non bank Sponsored SIVs(3,6) December 2007 82,000 Letter of Credit(5) March 2008 150,000 Capital Support Agreements(5) March 2008 400,000 400,000 Total $ 1,966,000 $ 840,730 (1) Included in current restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (2) Pertains to Citi Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C.

(USD Fund) (4) Pertains to the Legg Mason Western Asset Canadian Money Market Fund (5) Pertains to Citi Institutional Liquid Reserves Portfolio, a Series of Master Portfolio Trust (6) Securities issued by SIVs Letters of Credit In November 2007, we entered into arrangements with two large banks to provide letters of credit (LOCs) for an aggregate amount of approximately $335 million for the benefit of two liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support this agreement, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. On March 7, 2008, we elected to procure a LOC from a large bank to support another funds holdings in certain SIV issued securities. The March LOC provides support up to $150 million, which is further supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. Each of the LOCs may be drawn in certain circumstances, including upon the funds realizing a loss on disposition or restructuring of the underlying SIV securities, upon the agreements termination if unpaid amounts remain on the underlying securities, or in certain circumstances upon ratings downgrades of the issuing bank. In addition, the terms of the March LOC require that the fund sell the underlying securities if it continues to hold them at the LOCs expiration and draw on the LOC to make up for any losses on the sale. The LOCs will terminate no later than one year from the date of origination. Capital Support Agreements In November 2007, we entered into a capital support agreement (CSA) with one of the liquidity funds discussed above pursuant to which we have agreed to 47 Table of Contents provide up to $15 million in capital contributions to the fund if it recognizes losses from certain investments or continues to hold the underlying securities at the expiration of the one year term of the agreement and, at the applicable time, the funds net asset value is less than a specified threshold. On March 31, 2008, we also entered into CSAs with another fund under which we will make capital contributions if the fund realizes a loss on the sale of, or certain other events relating to, two SIV issued securities in the portfolio. We will make up to a maximum of $400 million of contributions to the fund under the March CSAs and have fully collateralized this obligation. The CSAs will terminate no later than one year from the date of origination, and the March CSA requires the fund to sell the securities at termination, if it still holds them, and utilize the CSA to cover any losses. Total Return Swap In December 2007, we reduced a Dublin domiciled fund holdings in SIV issued securities through the total return swap discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the total return swap, we will pay to the bank counterparty (the Bank) any losses (including losses incurred through a sale of the securities or through principal not being repaid at maturity) the Bank incurs from its ownership of the securities and a return on the purchase price paid for the underlying securities equal to the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, and the Bank will pay to us any principal and interest it receives on the securities in excess of the price it paid for the securities. The total return swap arrangement terminates in November 2008. However, we may elect to earlier terminate the total return swap arrangement at any time. The Bank may elect early termination of the total return swap arrangement in certain circumstances, including if an event has a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, if the credit ratings of our senior debt are reduced below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service or if we do not maintain, on a consolidated basis, at least $250 million in aggregate cash and cash equivalents plus amounts available to be borrowed under revolving credit facilities. Upon a termination of the total return swap arrangement, any outstanding securities will be sold at market prices and we will be responsible to reimburse the Bank for any losses the Bank incurs in the sale. The maximum future amount that we could be required to pay under the total return swap arrangement would be the aggregate price paid by the Bank for the securities of $832 million plus financing costs. In connection with the total return swap, we reimbursed the Dublin domiciled fund $59.5 million and provided $139.5 mil lion in cash collateral, which under the terms of the total return swap may be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. Purchase of Non bank Sponsored SIVs In December 2007, we purchased for cash an aggregate of $132 million in principal amount of non bank sponsored SIV securities from the same Dublin domiciled liquidity fund. During January 2008 and May 2008, approximately $50 million and $82 million, respectively, in principal amount of the securities matured and were paid in full. Purchase of Canadian Conduit Securities In December 2007, we acquired for cash an aggregate of $98 million in principal amount of conduit securities issued by Canadian asset backed commercial paper issuers to provide liquidity support to a Canadian liquidity fund. As the LOCs, CSAs and total return swap expire over the coming ten months, we may be required to provide substantial amounts to the funds and the banks if they still hold the underlying securities at the expiration time. We may elect to provide additional credit or other support to liquidity funds managed by our subsidiaries, if we deem this action necessary and appropriate in the future. If we do so, we may be required to use additional cash to pay for the support or as collateral. The pledge of cash and the investment in the funds restrict our ability to use the cash for other purposes and, together with any future uses of cash to provide additional support, reduce our flexibility to use these assets for other corporate purposes, including debt repayments, stock repurchases and acquisitions. 48 Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2008: Type FaceAmount Amount Outstanding at March 31, Interest Rate Maturity 2008 2007 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 $ 2.50% January 2015 Revolving Credit Agreement(1) 1,000,000 500,000 LIBOR + 0.60% October 2010 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 650,000 LIBOR + 0.60% October 2010 6.75% Senior Notes 425,000 424,959 424,796 6.75% July 2008 (1) $150 million of the available $500 million is reserved in connection with the LOC for the same amount to support certain SIV issued holdings by proprietary liquidity funds. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet by providing additional liquidity that will be used for general corporate purposes, including support for key business initiatives such as potential future acquisitions and to purchase and then retire convertible preferred stock. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. This transaction closed on January 31, 2008. We used approximately $180 million of the capital raised to purchase and retire preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. This facility matures on October 14, 2010, may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. On January 3, 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 7, 2008, we elected to procure a LOC to support up to $150 million of certain SIV issued holdings in a liquidity fund under this facility. See previous discussion on liquidity fund support. Included in outstanding debt is $425 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The $425 million principal amount of senior notes was reclassified to the current portion of long term debt during the September 2007 quarter. The accreted balance at March 31, 2008 was $425 million. During fiscal 2006, holders of zero coupon contingent convertible notes aggregating $480 million principal amount at maturity converted the notes into approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock. During fiscal 2007, all remaining outstanding zero coupon contingent convertible senior notes were converted into 756 thousand shares of common stock. In May 2008, we issued $1.15 billion of Equity Units, each unit consisting of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of senior notes due June 30, 2021, with interest payable quarterly at the annual rate of 5.6% and a purchase contract committing the holder to purchase shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% and are required to pledge their interests in senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include support of liquidity funds managed by its subsidiaries, financing acquisitions and repayment of outstanding debt. During the December 2007 quarter, both Fitch Ratings and Moodys Investors Service changed their outlook on our senior unsecured debt to negative from stable as a 49 Table of Contents result of the firms support of its liquidity funds. In April 2008, Standard and Poors Rating Services revised the outlook on its rating on Legg Mason to stable from positive. Our debt ratings at March 31, 2008 for Moodys Investors Service, Standard and Poors Rating Services and Fitch Ratings were A2, BBB+ and A, respectively. On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of CAM in exchange for (i) all outstanding stock of our subsidiaries that constituted our PC/CM businesses; (ii) 5,393,545 shares of common stock and 13.346632 shares of our non voting convertible preferred stock, which is convertible, upon transfer, into 13,346,632 shares of common stock; and (iii) $512 million in cash borrowed under a $700 million five year syndicated term loan facility. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a post closing purchase price adjustment of $84.7 million to Citigroup in September 2006, based on the retention of certain AUM nine months after the closing. Since this contingent payment was paid from available cash, an unsecured 5 year, $300 million floating rate credit agreement that we had entered to fund this obligation terminated in accordance with its terms. During fiscal 2008 and 2006, we issued approximately 5.53 million and 4.96 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately 5.53 and 4.96 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the CAM acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash. On October 14, 2005, we entered into a syndicated five year $700 million unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. At closing, we borrowed $600 million, of which $512 million was used to fund the cash portion of the purchase and the remainder was used to fund acquisition related expenses. The remaining $100 million of the $700 million loan facility was drawn down in February 2006 for additional acquisition related costs. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap (Swap) to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this Swap began to unwind and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The outstanding balance under this facility was $550 million at March 31, 2008 and the remaining unamortized balance of the Swap was $150 million. Also in connection with the Citigroup transaction, one of our subsidiaries was the borrower under a 364 day promissory note of $83.2 million. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we paid from available cash the balance outstanding on this note. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We have the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right is not exercised, the holders of those equity interests have the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The aggregate consideration paid by us at closing was $800 million, of which $200 million was in the form of 1,889,322 newly issued shares of our common stock and the remainder was cash. We funded the cash portion of the acquisition from existing cash. In accordance with the terms of the transaction, we acquired preference shares representing an additional 7.5% ownership interest in Permal during the December 31, 2007 quarter, and it is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining 12.5% four years after the initial closing at prices based on Permals revenues. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, with a $961 million minimum price, excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, contingent acquisition payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, of which 50 Table of Contents $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in common stock. The remaining minimum obligation of $81 million as of March 31, 2008 is payable in November 2011, unless earned earlier. The agreements provide for additional consideration of up to $265 million based on Permals future revenues and earnings. We may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2008 and 2007, we paid approximately $12 million in each period in dividends on the preference shares, and we will pay a minimum of $15 million in dividends on the preference shares over the next 2 years. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to replenish funds used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million, which was accrued as a liability with a corresponding increase to goodwill at March 31, 2006. This payment is subject to certain limited claw back provisions through fiscal 2010. On February 26, 2008, we announced a definitive agreement in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, would acquire a majority of the overlay and implementation business of Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group, which includes its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale closed on April 1, 2008 and cash proceeds of approximately $181 million were received. At March 31, 2008, our total assets and stockholders equity were $11.8 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. During fiscal 2008, stockholders equity increased approximately $79.0 million, primarily due to net income and stock option exercises, offset by share repurchases and dividend payments. During the year ended March 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents increased by $279.9 million from $1.18 billion at March 31, 2007 to $1.46 billion at March 31, 2008. This excludes $604.6 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell and $851.7 million of restricted cash. Cash flows from operating activities provided $964.4 million, primarily attributable to net income, adjusted for non cash items and purchases of trading securities. Cash flows from investing activities used $1.9 billion, primarily attributable to funding restricted cash related to liquidity fund support transactions discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Permal contractual acquisition payment and payments for leasehold improvements for office relocations. Financing activities provided $1.2 billion, primarily due to proceeds from issuance of 2.5% convertible senior notes and short term borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, offset in part by dividend payments, repayment of principal on long term debt and common and preferred stock repurchases. In addition to the $1.15 billion Equity Units discussed above, we expect that cash flows provided by operating activities and cash on hand will be the primary sources of working capital for the next year. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors previously authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. On July 19, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4 million shares of common stock from the proceeds from the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and 51 Table of Contents retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2007 and 2006. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid cash dividends of $132.8 million, $109.9 million, and $78.6 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares on a discretionary basis. Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Special Purpose and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support in Notes 1, 17, and 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements include letters of credit, capital support agreements and a total return swap, which are fully described above and in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we have made or expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 7, 8, and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: Contractual and Contingent Obligations at March 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings $ 500.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 500.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 432.2 7.0 555.6 4.4 0.9 1,257.7 2,257.8 Coupon interest on short term and long term borrowings(1) 79.7 47.1 43.2 31.8 31.7 63.6 297.1 Minimum rental and service commitments 128.9 121.2 94.7 89.5 85.0 640.1 1,159.4 Minimum commitments under capital leases(2) 31.3 2.3 2.4 0.2 36.2 Total Contractual Obligations 1,172.1 177.6 695.9 125.9 117.6 1,961.4 4,250.5 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(3) 7.5 293.5 60.0 361.0 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(4,5,6) $ 1,179.6 $ 471.1 $ 695.9 $ 185.9 $ 117.6 $ 1,961.4 $ 4,611.5 (1) Coupon interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2008.

(3) The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (4) The table above does not include approximately $50.6 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range from fiscal 2009 to 2011. (5) The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $21.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. (6) The table above does not include our obligations under the $485 million in letters of credit, the $415 million in capital support agreements or the total return swap of $890 million. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments. Restructuring Charges In connection with the CAM transaction, we incurred costs of restructuring the business of the combined entities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. MARKET RISK A risk management committee oversees and coordinates risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. In addition, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM and underperformance of advisory contracts versus the applicable performance benchmarks 53 Table of Contents will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. We have entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds beginning in November 2007. These arrangements include letters of credit, capital support agreements and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increase our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. These fund support arrangements and the related risks are discussed below. Trading assets at March 31, 2008 and 2007 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2008 2007 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 207,305 $ 191,684 Proprietary fund product and other investments 140,267 81,482 Securities issued by SIVs 141,509 Total trading investments $ 489,081 $ 273,166 Approximately $169.8 million and $153.7 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income. Other trading investments of $37.5 million and $38.0 million at March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our non operating income and net income. Approximately $140.3 million and $81.5 million of trading assets at March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments in which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income and net income. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record or has other investors. The remaining trading assets include $141.5 million at March 31, 2008 in investments issued by SIVs acquired from liquidity funds our subsidiary manages, of which $82.0 million matured and was paid in full in May 2008. The fair value of these trading assets will also fluctuate with market changes and will impact our non operating income and net income. 54 Table of Contents Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2008 and 2007 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2008 2007 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 7,700 $ 8,297 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 81,703 58,265 Other investments 1,323 1,298 Total non trading investments 90,726 67,860 Derivative assets: Total return swap 45,706 Total non trading assets $ 136,432 $ 67,860 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ 551,654 $ Fluctuations in the market value of these non trading assets and the underlying securities of the non trading derivative assets and liabilities will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. While we have a derivative asset on the total return swap of $45.7 million at March 31, 2008, this arrangement covers an aggregate of $890 million in principal of SIV issued securities, substantially all of which is at risk, along with related financing costs. Also, in addition to recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $551.7 million at March 31, 2008, these arrangements collectively cover an aggregate of $3.4 billion in principal of SIV issued securities, for which our exposure is limited to approximately $900 million. Accordingly, these fund support arrangements currently expose us to $348.3 million of additional potential losses on SIV issued securities held by funds managed by a subsidiary. The total return swap and other fund support arrangements all have one year terms that expire no later than March 2009. See Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Australia, may impact our comprehensive and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. In addition, a portion of our outstanding floating rate debt is hedged through an interest rate swap that reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $911 million and $312 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is not hedged such that fluctuations in interest rates will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. The total return swap, under which we have recorded a derivative asset of $45.7 million at March 31, 2008, includes certain payment provisions based on LIBOR rates, such that fluctuation in interest rates will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 55 Table of Contents reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for other than temporary impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. In fiscal 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualify as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments are based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. As of March 31, 2008, we had $45.7 million of derivative assets included in Other current assets and $551.7 million of derivative liabilities included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exposure on these derivative instruments is based on the underlying securities values and related gains and losses may vary significantly in relation to their recorded balances. None of these derivative transactions are designated for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Other non operating income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income in fiscal 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we owned approximately $156.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, we also have approximately $81.7 million and $58.3 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), to provide a consistent definition of fair value and establish a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 has additional disclosure requirements and will be effective for fiscal 2009. The disclosure requirements include a classification of fair value measurements impacting an entitys financial statements among a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair values into three broad levels, where 56 Table of Contents measurements for Level 1 are based on quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 are based on direct or indirect observable inputs and Level 3 are based on unobservable inputs, including managements estimates. The provisions of SFAS 157 for recurring fair value measurements will be adopted by us during fiscal 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on fair value measurements in our consolidated financial statements. It is estimated that less than 3% of total assets and approximately 11% of total liabilities will meet the definition of Level 3, where fair values are based on unobservable inputs, including managements estimates. As a result, the fair values of these Level 3 assets and liabilities are potentially subject to more significant fluctuations in amounts ultimately realized. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon certain estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates and investment performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately $2.5 billion in goodwill, $3.9 billion in indefinite life intangible assets and $237.7 million in net amortizable intangible assets. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to 15 years. As of March 31, 2008, amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of 8 years. Goodwill is evaluated quarterly at the reporting unit level and is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Managed Investments, Institutional and Wealth Management divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of goodwill under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. The Wealth Management and Managed Investments reporting units represent approximately 56% and 40%, respectively, of our goodwill. Wealth Management goodwill is principally attributable to PCM; Managed Investments goodwill is principally attributable to the CAM acquisition. Projected cash flows for these divisions are assumed to grow 10% annually over the 57 Table of Contents next five years, with a long term annual growth rate of 5%. The projected cash flows are discounted at 12% to determine the present value. The discount rate is based on an estimated average risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital. For the Wealth Management reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to decline by more than 54% or the discount rate would have to increase to more than 19% for the goodwill to be deemed impaired. For the Managed Investments reporting unit, annual cash flows would have to decline by more than 49% or the discount rate would have to increase to more than 18% for the goodwill to be deemed impaired. We review the fair value of our intangible assets on a quarterly basis, considering projected cash flows, to determine whether the assets are impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current implied fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. The implied fair values of intangible assets subject to amortization are determined at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the estimated remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. Management contract intangible assets related to the retail separately managed accounts acquired in the CAM acquisition and client contracts acquired in the 2001 acquisition of PCM represent approximately 59% and 15%, respectively, of our total amortizable intangible assets. The CAM intangible asset has an original expected life of 12 years (which represents an annual contract turnover rate of 8%), with 9.7 years remaining. For CAM contracts to be impaired, cash flows would have to decline by approximately 59% or client attrition would have to increase sufficiently to decrease the remaining estimated life by more than 41%. The PCM intangible asset related to acquired client contracts had an original expected life of 18 years (which represents an annual contract attrition rate of 6%). During fiscal 2008, acquired client contracts and related assets under management declined significantly. Based on revised attrition estimates, the remaining useful lives were decreased to periods from one to five years at March 31, 2008. As a result of significant recent client attrition, declines in assets under management and revised estimate of remaining useful lives, the evaluation at March 31, 2008 indicated the amortized carrying value of $188 million would not be fully recoverable. Projected cash flows on remaining acquired contracts, discounted at a rate of 12%, indicated a remaining value of $37 million, and an impairment charge of $151 million on the PCM management contracts was recorded in the March 2008 quarter. At the current assumed client attrition rates, the cash flows generated by the underlying management contracts held by PCM would have to decline by approximately 35% for the asset to become further impaired. Similarly, with no change to the profitability of the contracts, client attrition would have to accelerate to a rate such that our remaining estimated useful life would decline by approximately 49% before the asset would be deemed impaired. For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent, trade names. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of proprietary fund contracts include the projected cash flows generated by those contracts and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows 58 Table of Contents for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth approximating market returns. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the CAM acquisition and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts account for approximately 65% and 24%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. Cash flows from the CAM and Permal contracts are assumed to grow at long term annual rates of 5% and 8%, respectively, which approximates the expected average market returns. The projected cash flows from the CAM and Permal funds are discounted at 12%. Changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in impairment. At current profitability levels, cash flows generated by the CAM mutual fund contracts would have to fall approximately 27% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised to 15% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Likewise, cash flows generated by the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to decline by approximately 76% or the discount rate increased to 28% for the asset to be deemed impaired. Trade names account for 3% of indefinite life intangible assets, approximately one third of which relates to PCM. Unlike PCMs management contracts, the recovery of trade name value considers all of PCMs cash flows, not just the acquired client contracts. At current profitability levels and an estimated 8% long term growth rate, cash flows generated by PCM would have to fall approximately 9% or the discount rate used in the test would have to be raised from 12.0% to 12.4% for the trade name to be considered for impairment. However, since trade names are considered to have an indefinite life, we continue to evaluate trade names with a long term view when determining impairment. Some of our business acquisitions, such as PCM, Royce and Permal involved closely held companies in which certain key employees were also owners of those companies. In establishing the purchase price, we may include contingent consideration whereby only a portion of the purchase price is paid on the acquisition date. The determination of these contingent payments is consistent with our methods of valuing and establishing the purchase price, and we record these payments as additional purchase price and not compensation when the contingencies are met. Historically, contingent payments have been recorded as additional goodwill. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and goodwill. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue stock options to officers, key employees and non employee members of our Board of Directors. During fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), Share Based Payment and related pronouncements using the modified prospective method and the related transition election. Under this method, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. As further described below, we determine the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model, with the exception of market based performance grants, which are valued with a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Prior to fiscal 2007, awards were also accounted for at grant date fair value, except for awards granted prior to April 1, 2003, that were recorded at their intrinsic value. As a result, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), no related compensation expense was recognized for the awards granted prior to April 1, 2003, and the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the 59 Table of Contents determination of net income for fiscal 2006 is less than that which would have been included if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Under the modified prospective method, the results for the year ended March 31, 2006 have not been restated. Additionally, unamortized deferred compensation previously classified as a separate component of stockholders equity has been reclassified as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under SFAS No. 123 (R), cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2008. For the year ended March 31, 2006, such amount was $92,376, and continues to be classified as operating cash inflows. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), we provide disclosure in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our pro forma results if compensation expense associated with all stock option grants had been recognized at grant date fair value over their respective vesting period. If we accounted for prior years stock option grants at grant date fair value, net income from continuing operations would have been reduced by $3.2 million in fiscal 2006, respectively. Net income from discontinued operations would have been reduced by $4.0 million in fiscal 2006. These reductions are the result of including additional expenses for grants made prior to April 2003. We granted 933,000, 1,037,380, and 1,101,105 stock options, including grants to non employee directors, in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for performance or market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility in part based upon the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the Federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we 60 Table of Contents determine that our estimates have changed, the income tax provision will be adjusted in the period in which that determination is made. During fiscal 2008, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), that prescribes recognition and measurement thresholds in financial statements for tax positions. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding income taxes.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this 2008 Annual Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our businesses or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases can be, may be, expects, may affect, may depend, believes, estimate, project, anticipate and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. 61 Table of Contents Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible and goodwill values. See discussion of Market Risks Revenues and Net Income and Critical Accounting Policies Intangibles and Goodwill previously discussed. ITEM 7A.
