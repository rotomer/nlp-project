MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management. In connection with changes to our executive management during fiscal 2009 and a desire to expand multi channel distribution capabilities and to better align our resources to access new growth opportunities, we realigned our management responsibilities. As a result, we now manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. Our division managers report directly to our Chief Executive Officer. The Americas Division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. We believe this structure will provide greater focus and allow us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad. Presentation of all previously reported amounts have been conformed to the new management structure. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. 34 Table of Contents The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The economic downturn of the past year contributed to a significant contraction in our business. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been dramatically impacted by the economic downturn of the past year, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the fixed income markets have endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles ("SIVs") became substantially reduced. As a result, and to protect our clients, we entered into several arrangements during fiscal 2008 and 2009 to provide support to liquidity funds that are managed by a subsidiary that had invested in SIV securities. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States was volatile during fiscal 2009 and challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year. The sharp decline in equity markets and continuing dislocations in the credit markets adversely affected the entire financial sector during fiscal 2009. The equity markets suffered from pullback in consumer spending, which led to weak performance in global markets, increased unemployment, and significant declines in the values of assets owned by financial institutions. Investors confidence continued to weaken, which caused a shift in the markets from equity and corporate bonds to U.S. treasury notes and bonds. As a result, all three major U.S. equity market indices declined sharply during the fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,(1) NASDAQ Composite Index(2) and the S&P 500(3) were down 38%, 33% and 40%, respectively, for the fiscal year. The Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index(4) increased 3% and the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index(4) decreased 5%. During fiscal 2009, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the discount rate by 2.00% to the current rate of 0.25%. Our results were negatively impacted by many of these factors. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2010. We expect the challenges presented by the credit markets to persist throughout the next fiscal year. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. (1)Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

During fiscal 2009, we eliminated the exposure to SIVs of all liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary by purchasing and subsequently selling, or reimbursing the funds for a portion of the losses they incurred in selling, all securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds and held by us. The majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit or a total return swap ("TRS") prior to the purchase. These transactions, along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than SIVs, resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $2.3 billion. Also, during fiscal 2009, impairment charges of $1.3 billion were recorded, related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division, as a result of declines in the assets under management ("AUM") and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division, and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name. Cash loss from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $2.2 billion, or $15.74 per diluted share, compared to cash income of $412.3 million, or $2.86 per diluted share, in the prior year. These decreases were primarily due to an increase in net losses related to the elimination of SIV exposure, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, of $1.1 billion, or $7.61 per diluted share, and an increase in pre tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion, or $8.25 per diluted share. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to (94.0%) from 9.6% in the prior year. The pretax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to (132.2%) from 13.2% in the prior year. During fiscal 2009, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 66.2 percentage points and 39.0 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 93.1 percentage points and 54.8 percentage points, respectively. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 2008 Beginning of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds: Sales 35.6 38.5 Redemptions (58.3 ) (57.1 ) Separate account flows, net (121.2 ) (13.4 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) 5.7 Net client cash flows (158.9 ) (26.3 ) Market performance(1) (157.7 ) 9.9 Dispositions (1.1 ) (2.0 ) End of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 (1)Includes impact of foreign exchange AUM at March 31, 2009 were $632.4 billion, a decrease of $317.7 billion or 33% from March 31, 2008. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $159 billion and market depreciation of $158 billion, of which approximately 10% was related to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation. There were net client outflows in all asset classes. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $89 billion, or 56% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $47 billion and $23 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset") that have experienced investment performance issues, especially over the last fiscal year. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by key equity products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM") and Permal. Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal 2007. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. In addition, due in part to recent investment performance issues, we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class for the past five quarters. 37 Table of Contents Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. In response to the unprecedented market turmoil, during the December quarter, Permal temporarily modified its redemption notice timing to require 95 day prior notification rather than the historical 20 days. With the objective of returning to the 20 day notice period by January 2010, the current 95 day notice period for redemptions will be reduced to 65 days beginning with the September 30, 2009 redemption date. As of March 31, 2009, Permal had received approximately $2.4 billion of gross redemption notices that, unless withdrawn, will be redeemed in the June quarter. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Equity $ 126.9 20.1 $ 271.6 28.6 (53.3 ) Fixed Income 357.6 56.5 508.2 53.5 (29.6 ) Liquidity 147.9 23.4 170.3 17.9 (13.2 ) Total $ 632.4 100.0 $ 950.1 100.0 (33.4 ) The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2008 $ 271.6 $ 508.2 $ 170.3 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Sales 20.9 14.7 35.6 Redemptions (32.2 ) (26.1 ) (58.3 ) Separate account flows, net (35.3 ) (77.7 ) (8.2 ) (121.2 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (46.6 ) (89.1 ) (23.2 ) (158.9 ) Market performance (97.0 ) (61.5 ) 0.8 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) (1.1 ) March 31, 2009 $ 126.9 $ 357.6 $ 147.9 $ 632.4 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Equity $ 203.2 25.1 $ 327.6 33.1 (38.0 ) Fixed Income 438.0 54.0 498.6 50.3 (12.2 ) Liquidity 169.2 20.9 163.9 16.6 3.2 Total $ 810.4 100.0 $ 990.1 100.0 (18.1 ) 38  Table of Contents AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 446.5 70.6 $ 671.2 70.6 (33.5 ) International 185.9 29.4 278.9 29.4 (33.3 ) Total $ 632.4 100.0 $ 950.1 100.0 (33.4 ) The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2008 $ 671.2 $ 278.9 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Sales 28.3 7.3 35.6 Redemptions (46.4 ) (11.9 ) (58.3 ) Separate account flows, net (84.5 ) (36.7 ) (121.2 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (6.7 ) (8.3 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (109.3 ) (49.6 ) (158.9 ) Market performance (114.3 ) (43.4 ) (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) (1.1 ) March 31, 2009 $ 446.5 $ 185.9 $ 632.4 During April 2009, we estimate that our AUM increased approximately 1% from March 31, 2009 as a result of positive market performance of 4% offset by net client outflows of 3%. These outflows were consistent with March quarter outflows. Equity assets increased 7% partially offset by a decrease in liquidity assets of 1%. Investment Performance(5) Legg Mason is a diversified global asset management company that offers a wide range of investment products. We provide investment services to both retail and institutional clients that span many asset classes, levels of risk, geographic locations and investment styles. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, equity assets accounted for 20% and 29%, respectively, fixed income accounted for 57% and 53%, respectively, and liquidity accounted for the remaining 23% and 18%, respectively, of our assets under management. The past 12 months were characterized by significant volatility with erratic, unprecedented price movements across a variety of markets. The markets have been significantly impacted by the failure of major financial institutions, the freeze in the credit markets and unprecedented government intervention. In addition, the downturn in housing that led the U.S. into a broader slowdown set off financial turmoil that continues. As a result, financial stocks led the equity markets lower, with the S&P 500 Financials Index down 63%, compared to the broader S&P 500 Index, which dropped 38%. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88% of our marketed equity composite(6) assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 53%, 53%, 49%, and 94% of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. (5)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (6)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2009, 85% of our equity assets under management and 84% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. As of March 31, 2008, 86% of our equity assets under management and 83% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. 39 Table of Contents In the fixed income markets, the economic crisis deepened, but the governments numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery, causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the March 2009 quarter. The new fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy, and the governments intention to issue more public debt for financing, caused yields to rise during the quarter. For the 1 year period, Treasury yields have decreased significantly while long term rates have increased resulting in a steeper yield curve. In addition, the worst performing sectors were home equity asset backed securities and investment grade corporate securities as measured by the Barclays ABS Home Equity Index returning (35)% and the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index returning (7)% for the 1 year period. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 4%, 21%, 54%, and 74% of our fixed income marketed composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 41%, 45%, 57%, and 85% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 45%, 50%, 50%, and 91% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 38%, 41%, 45%, and 72% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 33%, 34%, 67%, and 68% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 2,290.5 68.2 $ 3,217.2 69.4 (28.8 ) International 1,066.9 31.8 1,416.9 30.6 (24.7 ) Total $ 3,357.4 100.0 $ 4,634.1 100.0 (27.6 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by LMCM, ClearBridge and Royce & Associates, LLC ("Royce"), decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), ClearBridge and LMCM and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to a decline in fund revenues and performance fees at Permal, lower separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from International balanced and fixed income funds. (7)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 40 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2009 were $3.4 billion, down 28% from $4.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an 18% decrease in average AUM, due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately 38% and fixed income assets of approximately 12%. The shift in the mix of AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately $115.3 million, or 87%. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $447.3 million, or 31%, to $1.0 billion. Of this decrease, $273.1 million was the result of lower average equity assets at PCM, ClearBridge, LMCM and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC ("Brandywine"), $80.9 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, and $43.9 million was the result of the sale of the Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") business. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the sale. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $483.4 million, or 21%, to $1.8 billion. Of this decrease approximately $450 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at LMCM, ClearBridge, Permal, and Royce, approximately $76 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, offset by approximately $42 million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed, primarily at Western Asset. Performance fees decreased 87%, or $115.3 million, to $17.4 million during fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 31% to $475.0 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds, which resulted in a decrease of $176.7 million. Operating Expenses During the past year, market conditions have contributed to a reduction in our AUM, revenues and earnings. As discussed above, although a significant portion of our expenses are variable and largely increase or decrease proportionately with revenue, a portion of our expenses are fixed and do not decline with reduced revenues. As a result of the substantial decline in revenues during fiscal 2009, certain actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily include reductions in headcount and discretionary incentive compensation in administrative and business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of travel and entertainment costs. These measures, and other less significant actions, have resulted in the elimination of approximately $135 million in costs on an annualized basis, before costs incurred to achieve these savings, such as severance. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2009, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a $341 million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal 2009; the impact of cost savings initiatives, such as reductions in headcount, discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately $86 million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately $59 million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans (which are largely offset by losses in other non operating expense). These decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of $40 million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held SIV issued securities. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to 33.7% from 33.9% in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 24% to $970.0 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 2% to $188.3 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an $11.3 million decrease in 41 Table of Contents technology consulting fees, offset in part by a $4.1 million increase in market data costs for services previously included in Other expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure. Occupancy expense increased 62% to $209.5 million, primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling $70.1 million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of $9.0 million. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 36% to $36.5 million, primarily as a result of the sale of the LMPPG business, which reduced amortization expense by $10.6 million, and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year 2008, which reduced amortization expense by $6.6 million. Impairment charges increased to $1.3 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division. The remaining $146 million relates to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and a related trade name. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $27.8 million to $182.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of $11.4 million, lower professional fees of $7.2 million and lower advertising costs of $5.4 million. In addition, the sale of the LMPPG overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately $5 million. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 will continue to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009. In addition, we have planned and are in the process of implementing additional cost reductions to bring the total amount to $160 million on an annualized basis by September 30, 2009. However, our business is dynamic and requires us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business. For example, operating expenses in fiscal 2010 will reflect incremental costs of approximately $10 million associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters. In addition, from time to time we fill key positions and take actions to retain key talent that would require additional compensation. As discussed above, during fiscal 2010, we will relocate our corporate headquarters. We are currently pursuing sub tenants for certain floors under lease that will be unoccupied as a result of headcount reductions. Given the current commercial real estate market, at the time we secure a sub lease or the space is deemed to be permanently abandoned, we will likely recognize a charge for the present value of the amount by which our commitment under our lease exceeds the amount due to us under the expected sub lease terms. However, subsequent to any such charge, occupancy expense will be reduced by the amount of our lease costs attributable to the sublet floors. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 27% to $56.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances, which decreased interest income by $42.1 million, offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt, which increased interest income by $25.3 million. Interest expense increased 82% to $150.5 million as a result of higher debt levels. We raised $1.15 billion in May 2008 by issuing Equity Units, and $1.25 billion by issuing 2.5% convertible senior notes in January 2008, which resulted in an increase of approximately $83.1 million in interest expense. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of $425 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes in July 2008 and lower interest rates paid on our term loan, which together resulted in a decrease of $28.6 million. During fiscal 2010, interest expense will increase by $32.3 million as a result of the adoption of FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. APB 14 1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)", related to our 2.5% convertible senior notes. See Other Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this FSP. Fund support losses increased $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of continued SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to 42 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $116.0 million to a loss of $109.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $58.3 million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above, and $33.1 million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit was $1.2 billion compared to income tax expense of $176.0 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 38.4% in the current year compared to a 39.7% provision in the prior year. The current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits. In addition, the current year includes approximately $80 million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary, offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income from Continuing Operations As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "cash income from continuing operations" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason. We define "cash income from continuing operations" as income (loss) from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment. We believe that cash income (loss) from continuing operations provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and it facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments. We also believe that cash income (loss) from continuing operations is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income from continuing operations is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider cash income from continuing operations to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value and because it facilitates comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense makes it difficult to compare our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill over time, we add them to income in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Conversely, we subtract income taxes on these impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. Should a disposition or impairment charge occur on indefinite life intangible assets or goodwill, its impact on cash income from continuing operations may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact, including taxes, on cash income from continuing operations to ensure appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany disclosures of cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 43 Table of Contents A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ (1,947,928 ) $ 267,610 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 36,488 57,271 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 142,494 143,600 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) (56,187 ) Cash Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ (2,213,564 ) $ 412,294 Cash Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations per diluted share $ (13.85 ) $ 1.86 Amortization of intangible assets 0.26 0.40 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 1.01 0.99 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) (0.39 ) Cash Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share $ (15.74 ) $ 2.86 The decrease in cash income from continuing operations was primarily due to an increase in pre tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion, or $8.25 per diluted share, and an increase in net losses related to the elimination of SIV exposure of $1.1 billion, or $7.61 per diluted share. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted We believe that pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 3,357,367 $ 4,634,086 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 969,964 1,273,986 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 2,387,403 $ 3,360,100 Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision (Benefit) and Minority Interests $ (3,155,857 ) $ 443,871 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis (94.0 )% 9.6 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted (132.2 ) 13.2 During fiscal 2009, losses related to liquidity fund support and impairment charges reduced the pre tax profit margin by 66.2 percentage points and 39.0 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 93.1 percentage points and 54.8 percentage points, respectively. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of management contracts reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. 44  Table of Contents FISCAL 2008 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2007 Financial Overview During fiscal 2008, we entered into several transactions to provide support to certain liquidity funds that held securities issued by SIVs that are managed by a subsidiary. These transactions resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $607.3 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, an impairment charge of $151.0 million was recorded for a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 totaled $267.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, a decrease of 59% and 58%, respectively, from the prior year. Cash income from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $412.3 million, or $2.86 per diluted share, each representing a decrease of 51% from the prior year. These decreases were primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the pre tax impairment charge of $151.0 million, or $1.05 per diluted share. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 9.6% from 24.0% in the prior year. The pretax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 13.2% from 33.2% in the prior year. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 2007 Beginning of period $ 968.5 $ 867.6 Net client cash flows (26.3 ) 44.2 Market performance 9.9 57.5 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (2.0 ) (0.8 ) End of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 AUM at March 31, 2008 were $950.1 billion, a decrease of $18.4 billion or 2% from March 31, 2007. Net client cash outflows for the fiscal year were $26.3 billion and were driven by outflows in equity assets of approximately $44 billion, resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, partially offset by approximately $15 billion and $3 billion of fixed income and liquidity inflows, respectively. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Equity $ 271.6 28.6 $ 338.0 34.9 (19.6 ) Fixed Income 508.2 53.5 470.9 48.6 7.9 Liquidity 170.3 17.9 159.6 16.5 6.7 Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Equity $ 327.6 33.1 $ 325.1 35.9 0.8 Fixed Income 498.6 50.3 441.9 48.8 12.8 Liquidity 163.9 16.6 138.8 15.3 18.1 Total $ 990.1 100.0 $ 905.8 100.0 9.3 45 Table of Contents AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Americas $ 671.2 70.6 $ 693.8 71.6 (3.3 ) International 278.9 29.4 274.7 28.4 1.5 Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2008 were as follows: Americas International Total AUM March 31, 2007 $ 693.8 $ 274.7 $ 968.5 Net client cash flows (8.7 ) (17.6 ) (26.3 ) Market performance (12.6 ) 22.5 9.9 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (1.3 ) (0.7 ) (2.0 ) March 31, 2008 $ 671.2 $ 278.9 $ 950.1 Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Americas $ 3,217.2 69.4 $ 3,169.4 73.0 1.5 International 1,416.9 30.6 1,174.3 27.0 20.7 Total $ 4,634.1 100.0 $ 4,343.7 100.0 6.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and Royce and increased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and Brandywine. These were partially offset by decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by PCM, decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The increase in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to increased fund revenues at Permal and Legg Mason Poland. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2008 were $4.6 billion, up 7% from $4.3 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 9% increase in average AUM, principally in the liquidity and fixed income asset classes. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 1%, or $18.7 million, to $1.46 billion, primarily as a result of higher average assets managed by Western Asset, Brandywine and Batterymarch Financial Management Inc., offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by PCM and ClearBridge. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 15% to $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets managed by Permal, Western Asset and Royce. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average assets managed by ClearBridge. Performance fees decreased 7%, or $9.5 million, to $132.7 million during fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of decreases in performance fees earned by Western Asset, and LMCM, which were partially offset by an increase in performance fees earned by Permal. 46 Table of Contents Distribution and service fees decreased 3% to $692.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic equity funds. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits remained flat at $1.6 billion, as increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues along with higher salary and benefits at certain of our subsidiaries were substantially offset by incentive expense reductions related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that hold SIV issued securities. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges related to our liquidity business. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 33.9% for fiscal 2008, down from 36.1% for fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of a reduction in compensation resulting from adjustments related to liquidity fund support. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 7% to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased average AUM at Permal and in liquidity assets for which we pay higher relative fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense increased 11% to $192.8 million, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense, technology maintenance, and other expenditures related to investment management and business continuity infrastructure and office relocations. Occupancy expense increased 29% to $129.4 million, primarily as a result of higher rent at new office locations and the impact of duplicate rent on facilities during relocation periods. Expense for impairment of management contracts was $151.0 million, related to the impairment of certain acquired management contracts as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition than previously estimated. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of management contracts. Other operating expenses increased 1% to $209.9 million, driven primarily by increased promotional expenses, offset in part by decreased expenses under a transition services agreement with Citigroup related to the integration of businesses acquired from Citigroup and prior year losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets as a result of office relocations. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $18.0 million to $76.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average firm investment account balances, offset in part by a decline in average interest rates earned on these balances. Interest expense increased $11.2 million to $82.7 million due to $500 million of new borrowings under our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the issuance of $1.25 billion of convertible senior notes in January 2008, offset in part by $150 million of principal reduction made on our $700 million term loan. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $628.7 million to a loss of $600.5 million, primarily as a result of losses related to liquidity fund support of approximately $607.3 million, which excludes $1.0 million of financing costs included in interest expense. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes decreased 56% to $176.0 million, primarily as a result of lower earnings due to losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of acquired management contract assets recorded during fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate increased to 39.7% from 38.1% in the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in earnings in higher state income tax rate jurisdictions as a result of the impairment and liquidity fund support charges at lower relative state income tax rates. 47 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income from Continuing Operations A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Income from Continuing Operations $ 267,610 $ 646,246 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 57,271 68,410 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 143,600 130,758 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (56,187 ) Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 412,294 $ 845,414 Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 1.86 $ 4.48 Amortization of intangible assets 0.40 0.47 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.99 0.91 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (0.39 ) Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 2.86 $ 5.86 The decrease in cash income from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the impairment of management contracts, net of income tax benefits, of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 4,634,086 $ 4,343,675 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 1,273,986 1,196,019 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 3,360,100 $ 3,147,656 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests $ 443,871 $ 1,043,854 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis 9.6 % 24.0 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted 13.2 33.2 During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of management contracts reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. 48 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. During fiscal 2008 and 2009, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that had invested in asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by SIVs. These arrangements are described in the Liquidity Fund Support section below. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. In order to ensure adequate resources for the liquidity fund support transactions as well as for general corporate purposes, we increased our capital base by $1.15 billion through the issuance of Equity Units during fiscal 2009. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents, refundable income taxes, investment advisory and related fee receivables and investment securities. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of our ongoing operations. At March 31, 2009, our cash, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.1 billion, $9.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash flows from operating activities $ 437.9 $ 1,144.3 $ 905.4 Cash flows used for investing activities (1,090.9 ) (2,103.3 ) (542.1 ) Cash flows from (used for) financing activities 301.1 1,220.6 (209.4 ) Effect of exchange rate changes (27.2 ) 18.4 6.2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (379.1 ) 280.0 160.1 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,463.6 1,183.6 1,023.5 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,084.5 $ 1,463.6 $ 1,183.6 Cash flows from operating activities were $437.9 million during fiscal 2009 compared to cash flows of $1,144.3 million for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in operating cash flows is primarily due to lower earnings driven by AUM and revenue declines in the current year. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2009 were $1.1 billion, primarily attributable to the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds, which used $2.9 billion, including $801.8 million of net cash collateral returned upon termination of associated support agreements. As discussed below, the liquidity fund support payments were funded in part with a portion of the proceeds of two debt issuances during calendar year 2008. The outflows were offset, in part, by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and SIV securities of $604.6 million and $513.9 million, respectively, cash proceeds of $181.1 million received for the sale of LMPPG and the return of a portion of a contingent earnout payment from the PCM acquisition of $120.0 million that was previously funded into escrow. Cash flows from financing activities provided $301.1 million, primarily due to the $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the offering of Equity Units in May, offset in part by the repayment of the $425 million 6.75% senior notes in July and the $250 million repayment on our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2009. A portion of the proceeds of the Equity Units offering and a $1.25 billion offering of convertible senior notes in January 2008 has been used to help fund the liquidity fund support and the senior notes repayment discussed above. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid cash dividends of $135.9 million, $132.8 million, and $109.9 million, respectively. On May 5, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share, representing a quarterly reduction of $0.21 per share from our prior dividend. 49 Table of Contents We expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. During the past year, difficult market conditions have contributed to a reduction in our AUM and revenues and resulted in a reduction in the cash generated by our operations, which is our primary source of added liquidity. If this trend continues, we would expect that the available cash generated by our operations would continue to decrease. However, in an effort to mitigate the effects of declining market conditions and lower revenue levels, we have reduced our corporate expenses by approximately $135 million on an annualized basis as of March 31, 2009, excluding costs to achieve these savings, such as severance, and have planned additional reductions of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2010. In addition, we also expect to receive approximately $600 million in tax refunds in fiscal 2010, primarily attributable to the carry back tax benefit on the realized losses incurred on the sale of SIV securities. These refunds are expected to be received in the next six months. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to replenish funds used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. We anticipate repatriating additional amounts starting in fiscal year 2010, although timing is currently uncertain. Any repatriated amounts will effectively increase our available cash. In addition to our ordinary operating cash needs, as discussed above, we anticipate several other cash needs during the next twelve months. In November 2009, we may be required to pay up to $286 million under the agreements governing the Permal acquisition, with the amount of the payment to be determined based on Permals operating results. The final payment for this transaction in November 2011 will be between $60 million and $320 million based on Permals results and the amount of the fiscal 2010 payment. We may pay up to 25% of each of these payments in shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we will move into a new corporate headquarters and expect to incur total costs for the new building of approximately $92 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and furniture, of which approximately $44 million was paid during the year ended March 31, 2009. As discussed below, if our earnings remain at current levels, we would expect to repay a portion of our bank debt by December 2009. We may also elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repayment of outstanding debt, or acquisitions. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If this were to occur, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. However, current market conditions would make it difficult to raise additional capital, and would increase the costs of doing so. In addition, our debt covenants currently prevent us from incurring more than $250 million in additional indebtedness. 50  Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2009: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Face Amount Type 2009 2008 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 1,150,000 1,150,000 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 500,000 LIBOR + 2.25% October 2010 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 550,000 LIBOR + 2.25% October 2010 6.75% Senior Notes 425,000 424,959 6.75% July 2008 In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% senior notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion are being used for general corporate purposes, which to date has primarily included the purchase of SIV securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. This transaction closed on January 31, 2008. We used approximately $180 million of the capital raised to purchase and retire preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. This facility matures on October 14, 2010, may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. On January 3, 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 4, 2008, we elected to procure a letter of credit ("LOC") to support up to $150 million of certain SIV issued holdings in a liquidity fund under this facility. See discussion on liquidity fund support below. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from $1 billion to $500 million and further modified covenants, as discussed below. On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Citigroups asset management business ("CAM") in exchange for (i) all outstanding stock of our subsidiaries that constituted our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses; (ii) 5,393,545 shares of common stock and 13.346632 shares of our non voting convertible preferred stock, which is convertible, upon transfer, into 13,346,632 shares of common stock; and (iii) $512 million in cash borrowed under a $700 million five year syndicated term loan facility. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a post closing purchase price adjustment of $84.7 million to Citigroup in September 2006, based on the retention of certain AUM nine months after the closing. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately .36 million and 5.53 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately .36 and 5.53 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the CAM acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash. 51 Table of Contents In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap ("Swap") to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this Swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The outstanding balance under this facility was $550 million at March 31, 2009 and the Swap fully matured in December 2008. Also in connection with the Citigroup transaction, one of our subsidiaries borrowed $83.2 million under a 364 day promissory note. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we paid from available cash the balance outstanding on this note. Included in outstanding debt as of March 31, 2008 is $425 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The accreted balance of $425 million was repaid from available cash in July 2008. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. The May 2008 issuance of Equity Units resulted in our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeding that limit, although we received a waiver of the covenant to allow us to complete the transaction. The waiver prevents us from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. The sales of SIV securities during fiscal year 2009 reduced our EBITDA under the definition, thus further increasing our ratio for purposes of this covenant. As a result of these two events, we may not, subject to a few limited exceptions, incur more than $250 million in new indebtedness until the effects of the sales of SIV securities is no longer in the trailing twelve month EBITDA calculation and when we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness. Our $500 million revolving line of credit, as revised, of which $250 million is currently outstanding, and our $550 million term loan also contain financial covenants. These covenants include: maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. The maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was increased from 2.5 to 3.0 in a November 2008 amendment. In March 2009, the maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was revised to allow us to reduce includable debt by unrestricted cash in excess of up to $500 million in working capital. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, any non cash charges and up to $3.0 billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support. As of March 31, 2009, Legg Masons debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 6.2, and therefore Legg Mason is in compliance with these covenants. If our net income remains at current levels or further declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, use available cash to repay all or a portion of our $800 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. Based on March run rate EBITDA, and factoring projected cost savings, we would be required to repay over half of our outstanding bank debt by December 2009 to maintain compliance with our covenants. However, based on improved April run rate results, repayment of debt may not be required to maintain compliance with our covenants. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay all or a portion of our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by all three rating agencies that follow us: Moodys Investor Services ("Moodys"), Standard and Poors Rating Services ("Standard and Poors"), and Fitch Ratings. Our current Moodys rating is A3 with a 52 Table of Contents negative outlook. Our current Standard and Poors rating is BBB+ with a negative outlook and our current Fitch rating is A with a negative outlook. In the event of a one level downgrade by Moodys or Standard and Poors, the interest rate on our five year term loan and revolving line of credit will increase by 0.25% per annum. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We have the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right is not exercised, the holders of those equity interests have the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, representing earnout payments based upon Permals revenues through the second anniversary date and the purchase of 37.5% of the preference shares, of which $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in our common stock. It is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining 62.5% of the preference shares in fiscal 2010 at amounts based on Permals revenues, at which time we may be required to pay up to $286 million under the agreements governing the Permal acquisition. The final payment for this transaction on the sixth anniversary in fiscal 2012 will be between $60 million and $320 million based on Permals revenues and the amount of the fiscal 2010 payment. We may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid an aggregate amount of approximately $31.5 million in dividends on the preference shares, and we will pay a minimum of $7.5 million in dividends on the preference shares in fiscal 2010. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, are recognized as additional goodwill. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors previously authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. On July 19, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4 million shares of common stock from the proceeds from the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2009 and 2007. Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. 53 Table of Contents Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: 2009 2008 Earliest Transaction Date Description Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Letters of Credit(2) November 2007 $ $ $ 335,000 $286,250 Capital Support Agreement(3) November 2007 15,000 15,000 Purchase of Canadian Conduit Securities(4) December 2007 94,000 Total Return Swap(3) December 2007 890,000 139,480 Purchase of Non bank Sponsored SIVs(3,5) December 2007 82,000 Letter of Credit(6) March 2008 150,000 Capital Support Agreements(6) March 2008 400,000 400,000 Capital Support Agreements(7) September 2008 34,500 34,500 Capital Support Agreements(3) October 2008 7,000 7,000 Total $ 41,500 $ 41,500 $ 1,966,000 $840,730 (1)Included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (2)Pertains to Citi Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C.

(Euro Fund) and Citi Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Sterling Fund) During fiscal 2008, we entered into arrangements with two third party banks to provide LOCs for an aggregate amount of approximately $485 million for the benefit of three liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support four of these agreements, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. Additionally, one of the arrangements was supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2009, these LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $286 million in collateral was returned. During fiscal 2008, we entered into six capital support agreements ("CSAs"). Under the terms of the CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $415 million in support to two liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $415 million in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. During fiscal 2009, $200 million in principal amount of securities supported by one of these CSAs matured and were paid in full. The related CSA terminated in accordance with its terms and collateral of $15 million was returned. The remaining CSAs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the remaining $400 million in collateral was returned. Also during fiscal year 2008, we entered into a TRS arrangement with a major bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which the Bank purchased securities issued by three SIVs from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund managed by one of our subsidiaries. The $890 million in face amount of commercial paper was purchased by the Bank 54 Table of Contents for cash at an aggregate amount of $832 million, which represents an estimate of value determined for collateral purposes. In addition, we reimbursed the fund for the $59.5 million difference between the funds carrying value, including accrued interest, and the amount paid and provided $139.5 million in cash collateral, which under the terms of the agreements could be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. During fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to two liquidity funds in the form of two standby letters of credit in the total amount of approximately $257 million. We provided collateral equal to the total support amount under the LOCs. These LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the $257 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we entered into and amended various capital support agreements. Under the terms of the new and amended CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $1.07 billion in support to particular liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $1.07 billion in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. CSAs aggregating $1.03 billion terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $1.03 billion of collateral was returned. Contributions made under any of our CSAs will not result in our acquiring an ownership or other interest in the fund. The four CSAs remaining at March 31, 2009 include a recovery clause in which the funds are required to reimburse us for all contributions made upon the expiration of the CSA to the extent that the funds subsequently receive payments from the issuer of the underlying securities or upon the sale or other disposition thereof that exceed the amortized cost of the underlying securities at the time the amounts are paid under the CSAs. During fiscal 2009, $440 million in principal amount of securities previously supported under the TRS arrangement matured and were paid in full and an additional $95 million in principal amount of securities under the TRS arrangement was repaid. Also during fiscal 2009, non bank sponsored SIV securities purchased from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund in fiscal 2008 matured and $82 million in principal amount and interest was paid in full. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from six liquidity funds that were previously supported under twelve CSAs and seven LOCs. Upon the purchase of these securities, the twelve CSAs aggregating $1.4 billion and seven LOCs aggregating $742 million were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which includes the return of $1.03 billion and $257 million of collateral provided during the current fiscal year to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs, respectively. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by the TRS and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. Our four remaining CSAs to provide an aggregate $42 million of support for investments in non SIV securities to certain funds expire on or before March 31, 2010. If the funds continue to hold the underlying securities and market conditions have not improved when the agreements expire, we will likely be required to utilize cash to address our obligations under these support arrangements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future 55 Table of Contents effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Notes 1, 16 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, most of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2009, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS, which are fully described above and in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we have made or expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 8.2 553.8 2.6 1.1 0.9 2,406.8 2,973.4 Coupon interest on short term and long term borrowings(2) 135.5 122.1 112.3 112.2 112.2 615.5 1,209.8 Minimum rental and service commitments 161.5 110.8 102.2 94.2 87.6 674.3 1,230.6 Minimum commitments under capital leases(3) 31.3 2.4 1.9 35.6 Total Contractual Obligations 586.5 789.1 219.0 207.5 200.7 3,696.6 5,699.4 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(4) 293.5 60.0 353.5 Capital support(5) 41.5 41.5 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(6,7) $ 921.5 $ 789.1 $ 279.0 $ 207.5 $ 200.7 $ 3,696.6 $ 6,094.4 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until October 2010. However, we may elect to repay this debt in fiscal 2010 if we have sufficient available cash. (2)Coupon interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2009 and includes 1.4% contract adjustment payments on Equity Units. (3)The amount of commitments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the agreements. (4)The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (5)The amount of contingent obligations under capital support agreements represents the maximum amount that could be payable at any time up through the contracts termination dates. (6)The table above does not include approximately $29.5 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a general or limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal 2011. (7)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $35.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. 56  Table of Contents MARKET RISK A risk management committee oversees and coordinates risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. In addition, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. Beginning in November 2007, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds. These arrangements included LOCs, CSAs, a TRS arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or the funds sold, all remaining securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure. Prior to the purchase, the majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit and a TRS. The various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. As of March 31, 2009, four CSAs to provide up to a maximum of $41.5 million in support of net asset values of four funds, with underlying investments in over $1.8 billion in non asset backed securities, remain outstanding. During April 2009, one of the CSAs representing $7.0 million of the $41.5 million terminated while incurring no loss. These fund support arrangements and the related risks are discussed below. Trading investments at March 31, 2009 and 2008 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2009 2008 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 128,785 $ 207,305 Proprietary fund products and other investments 207,307 140,267 Securities issued by SIVs 141,509 Total trading investments $ 336,092 $ 489,081 Approximately $119.0 million and $169.8 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income. Other trading investments of $9.8 million and $37.5 million at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. 57 Table of Contents Approximately $207.3 million and $140.3 million of trading assets at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $46.3 million and $67.4 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements and the fluctuations in market value of approximately $16.6 million as of March 31, 2009 is related to minority interest of consolidated investment funds. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. The remaining trading assets at March 31, 2008 include $141.5 million in investments issued by SIVs acquired from liquidity funds a subsidiary manages, of which $82.0 million matured and was paid in full in May 2008. The fair value of these trading assets fluctuated with market changes and impacted our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2009, all securities issued by SIVs were sold. Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2009 and 2008 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2009 2008 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 6,818 $ 7,700 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 59,515 81,703 Other investments 1,423 1,323 Total non trading investments 67,756 90,726 Derivative assets: Total return swap 45,706 Total non trading assets $ 67,756 $ 136,432 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ 20,631 $ 551,654 As previously discussed, by March 31, 2009, we effectively eliminated our exposure to SIVs. As of March 31, 2009, we recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $20.6 million, for which our exposure was limited to approximately $41.5 million. After the termination of one of the fund support arrangements in April 2009 for $7.0 million, our current exposure and additional potential losses on supported securities are $34.5 million and $13.9 million, respectively. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." The elimination of SIV exposure from our Balance Sheet and money market funds as of March 31, 2009 substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk. See Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. 58 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2009: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease Trading investments: Investment related to deferred compensation plans $ 128,785 $ 154,542 $ 103,028 Proprietary fund products and other 207,307 248,768 165,846 Total trading investment(1) 336,092 403,310 268,874 Available for sale investments 6,818 8,180 5,454 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 59,515 71,418 47,612 Other investments 1,423 1,708 1,138 Total investments subject to market risk $ 403,848 $ 484,616 $ 323,078 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ 20,631 $ 16,505 $ 24,757 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability, or minority interest. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $40.8 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings, respectively, as of March 31, 2009. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, the United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, and Japan, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $806 million and $1,061 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2009, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $8.1 million. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market 59 Table of Contents value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2009, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $126.9 billion, $357.6 billion, and $147.9 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. The recent economic events and financial market declines have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2009, less than 2% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. 60 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualify as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments are based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which support investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of $20.6 million was included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No derivative asset was recorded as of March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2008, we had $45.7 million of derivative assets included in Other current assets and $551.7 million of derivative liabilities included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exposure on these derivative instruments was based on the underlying securities values and related gains and losses may vary significantly in relation to their recorded balances. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2009 and 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, we owned approximately $42.2 million and $156.6 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2009 and 2008, we also have approximately $59.5 million and $81.7 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method. Effective April 1, 2008, we adopted Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and increases disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Under SFAS 157, a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. SFAS 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which: prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to fund support arrangements and investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions. 61  Table of Contents The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products are valued at net asset value ("NAV") determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. Our liquidity fund support has taken the form of CSAs, LOCs, a TRS arrangement and purchases of securities from funds as more fully described in Note 17. The CSAs, LOCs, and TRS arrangement are considered derivative assets or liabilities for accounting purposes representing the Companys rights and obligations under the support, the fair value of which is based principally on the value of the underlying securities. Substantially all of the underlying securities supported and all of the securities purchased from liquidity funds were issued by SIVs and had no active market such that fair value was determined based on an evaluation of the issuer trust and its underlying collateral, which are primarily comprised of asset and mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds, and collateralized debt obligations. These instruments may or may not have financial guaranty insurance. Of the total SIV securities we owned or supported in liquidity funds prior to the sale of SIV securities, over 60% of the underlying trust collateral securities were valued based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data; over 35% of the collateral securities were valued based on spreads to benchmark debt instruments with available prices; and less than 5% of the collateral values were based on broker quotes. All security prices, including prices for underlying trust collateral securities, whether direct market quotes, adjusted comparable security prices, or broker quotes, are subject to internal analyses that consider market observations, broker quotes and other tests to substantiate their fair values. Broker quotes used are indicative but not firm or tradable bids. Exclusive of these internal analytics, we generally do not obtain more than one price per instrument, unless we are relying on broker quotes, where we generally seek to use an average of at least two quotes. The prices utilized for underlying trust collateral securities incorporated both non performance and liquidity risks inherent in these securities and there were no further considerations of credit risk necessary relating to the trust or the issuers of the SIVs. In estimating the fair values for SIV related financial assets and liabilities (both securities owned and fund support derivatives) we assumed the value of the related SIV security equaled its percentage share of the sum of the values of the underlying collateral securities plus cash and other assets held by the trust, net of reported trust liabilities. In following this valuation approach, we assume that the SIV trust will distribute to holders all income and other returns received from the collateral securities. When no direct price for a particular collateral security is available, the price is based upon a review of available information, including prices for securities we believe are comparable. We use professional judgment to consider adjustments where appropriate including, for example, based on the nature of the collateral and its issue date. While these determinations may reflect, in whole or part, market observations, they are inherently subjective and it is not possible to further quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. Our credit risk is not a material factor to the fair value of the related derivative liabilities because, among other things, the majority of our liquidity fund support required cash collateral and we had available cash to cover uncollateralized positions. These valuation processes for supported or purchased SIV issued securities inherently required managements judgment and therefore the related assets and liabilities were classified in Level 3. Market changes affecting the underlying collateral are a primary contributor to changes in the fair values of the liquidity fund support assets and liabilities and the related gains and losses. As of March 31, 2009, approximately 1% of total assets and less than 1% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 62 Table of Contents Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2009 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 88,243 $ 11,797 $ 100,040 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,541,557 1,211,404 3,752,961 Trade names 69,800 69,800 Goodwill 907,078 279,669 1,186,747 $ 3,606,678 $ 1,502,870 $ 5,109,548 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform detail tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these detail tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not 63 Table of Contents appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Management contract intangible assets related to retail separately managed accounts sold through broker dealer sponsored programs acquired in the CAM transaction ("CAM management contracts") represented approximately $128.3 million or 69% of our total net amortizable intangible assets as of December 31, 2008, with a remaining life of approximately 9 years. However, we have experienced a recent trend of increased client outflows associated with these contracts. In addition, changes at the primary underlying program sponsor announced during the March quarter are expected to contribute further to this trend. The combination of these events has caused us to reduce the remaining expected life by approximately 40% to 5 years. The impact of reduced AUM levels, combined with the shorter expected life (recovery period), has resulted in our cumulative expected future cash flows to fall below the carrying value of the asset. On a discounted cash flow basis, this resulted in an impairment charge of $72 million. After the impairment charge, the CAM management contracts represent approximately $52 million or 52% of our total net amortizable intangible assets. As a result of significant client attrition, related declines in AUM and the associated revised estimate of remaining useful lives, our evaluation during fiscal 2009 of PCMs asset management contracts indicated the carrying value would not be fully recoverable. Based upon projected cash flows on remaining acquired contracts, discounted at a rate of 14.8%, the value of contracts was determined to be impaired and we recognized charges for the remaining book value totaling $26.6 million in fiscal 2009. Current cash flow projections were significantly lower than previous projections as a result of continued AUM outflows and decreased market value resulting in part from the recent severe market declines. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 9 years with a weighted average life of approximately 5 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent, trade names. The discounted projected cash flows used to value intangible assets take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates, which includes estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If such impairment exists, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the CAM acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. As a result of the dramatic changes in market conditions during the fiscal year, we revised our growth assumptions downward, to project contraction to minimal growth for the domestic mutual fund contracts and contraction for the Permal contracts through the next two years. Cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 4.0%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 7.5% thereafter. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 2.5%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 8.0% thereafter. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, 64 Table of Contents including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual funds and Permal funds are discounted at 13.7% and 14.7%, respectively. Changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in impairment. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 16% and 20%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15% and 17%, respectively, for the assets to be deemed impaired. With continued deterioration in the markets or other unfavorable factors, it is reasonably possible that actual cash flows from either or both the domestic mutual fund or Permal fund contracts could deviate from projections by more than 16% and 20%, respectively. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $480.3 million and $240.0 million, respectively. Trade names account for less than 2% of indefinite life intangible assets. The significant decrease in PCMs assets under management and related cash flows generated assessed values that resulted in full impairment of the $47 million PCM trade name asset during fiscal 2009. The assessment of this trade name fair value was based on a discounted cash flow model applying an after tax royalty rate to PCMs expected future revenues, using a discount rate of 14.8% and long term annual growth of 5%. Although the discounted cash flow model resulted in an immaterial assessed value, based on other qualitative factors, we believed the remaining amount was impaired. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted at 14.0% and 14.5%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of March 31, 2009, the implied fair values exceed the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, are assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 4%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 10%. Projected cash 65 Table of Contents flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division are assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 6%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 10%. Cash flow growth of 4% and 6% for Americas and International, respectively, over the next five years is based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections are based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods, in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business. On a combined basis for both equity and fixed income product types, these projections rely on an expectation that markets relevant to these products will stabilize with some rebalancing from fixed income to equity products during fiscal 2010. Long term growth of 10% for both divisions is based on our historical experience and available historic market statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 42% and 34%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 5 and 4 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. Under our prior management structure and related reporting units of Managed Investments, Institutional and Wealth Management, we recognized an impairment charge of $1,161,900 for the Wealth Management division during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The severe market turmoil experienced during the December quarter had a more significant impact on the Wealth Management division than on our other divisions. AUM in that division decreased over 30% as a result of both net client outflows and market depreciation. As a result of the dramatic changes in market conditions during the December quarter, growth assumptions were revised downward, to project contraction through the next two years. Further, the applicable discount rate was increased from 12.5% to 14.7% based on changes in interest rates and market risk factors. The combined impact of these factors decreased projected cash flows of the Wealth Management division by over 60% from our prior projections resulting in the impairment charge. Prior to the impairment charge, the majority of the goodwill of this division arose from the acquisition of PCM. Projected cash flows for the Wealth Management division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 3.0%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 8.0% compared to prior average growth rates of 7.3% and 10.0%, respectively. Growth of 3% over the next five years was based on the current market conditions, our past experience, market statistics and prospects of each of our more significant managers in this division. These projections relied on the expectation that markets relevant to products in this division will stabilize by fiscal 2011. Actual results will invariably differ from our assumptions, the impact of which could be material to the financial statements. Goodwill is the residual value of a reporting unit after all other identifiable assets in that reporting unit have been valued, including management contract intangible assets. If goodwill has been determined to be impaired, variances in assumptions that impact the value of the reporting unit will generally also impact the values of identifiable assets within the reporting unit before, and to a greater extent than, they impact goodwill. For example, if our growth assumptions for the Wealth Management Division and all its related intangible assets were decreased for all periods by 1%, the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the division would have increased by less than 2%, because the other intangible assets within the division would have correspondingly decreased in value. Likewise, if the discount rate for the Wealth Management Division and all its related intangible assets had been 15.7% (1 percentage point higher), the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the division would have increased by less than 2%. As indicated above, we performed our annual assessment of goodwill as of December 31. However, given the restructuring of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we reassessed the fair values of our former reporting units as of March 31, 2009, the results of which indicated the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. As of March 31, 2009, considering relevant prices of Legg Masons common shares and based on dilutive shares outstanding, inclusive of shares issuable under Equity Units, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, approximates its carrying value. In an 66 Table of Contents acquisition, there is typically a premium paid over current market prices of publicly traded companies that relates to the ability to control the operations of an acquired company. Recent market evidence regarding this control factor suggests premiums of 30% to 45% and higher as realistic and common, and Legg Mason believes such premiums to be a reasonable estimation for our equity value. Our market evidence is from a published source and included 150 transactions from the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Although there is limited transaction data subsequent to September 30, 2008, more recent transactions support or exceed the high end of our range. We exclude consideration of transactions with unique circumstances and find that transaction values for asset management firms relative to their respective book values do not vary significantly from relative transaction values in other industries. Continued disruption and depressed financial markets will further increase the potential for impairment of our goodwill and or other intangible asset carrying values. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to officers and key employees. During fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share Based Payment" and related pronouncements using the modified prospective method and the related transition election. Under this method, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under SFAS No. 123 (R), cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 1.5 million, 0.9 million, and 1.0 million stock options, including grants to non employee directors, in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. 67 Table of Contents Substantially all of Legg Masons deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. Although Legg Mason has been historically profitable, the current year SIV losses resulted in a U.S. tax loss for fiscal 2009. We believe SIV losses incurred on liquidity fund guarantees are unique and isolated. Therefore, any analysis of Legg Masons core U.S. earnings expected to recur in the future should exclude incurred SIV losses. As of March 31, 2009, U.S. deferred tax assets accumulated $1.3 billion, realization of which is expected to require $5.7 billion of future U.S. earnings. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2009, U.K. deferred tax assets are not material. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. Included in Refundable income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2009 is $603 million in tax refunds expected during fiscal year 2010, of which $275 million, $271 million and $57 million, relates to net operating and capital loss carrybacks and other refunds, respectively. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level 68 Table of Contents of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management. In connection with changes to our executive management during fiscal 2009 and a desire to expand multi channel distribution capabilities and to better align our resources to access new growth opportunities, we realigned our management responsibilities. As a result, we now manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. Our division managers report directly to our Chief Executive Officer. The Americas Division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. We believe this structure will provide greater focus and allow us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad. Presentation of all previously reported amounts have been conformed to the new management structure. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. 34 Table of Contents The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The economic downturn of the past year contributed to a significant contraction in our business. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been dramatically impacted by the economic downturn of the past year, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the fixed income markets have endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles ("SIVs") became substantially reduced. As a result, and to protect our clients, we entered into several arrangements during fiscal 2008 and 2009 to provide support to liquidity funds that are managed by a subsidiary that had invested in SIV securities. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States was volatile during fiscal 2009 and challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year. The sharp decline in equity markets and continuing dislocations in the credit markets adversely affected the entire financial sector during fiscal 2009. The equity markets suffered from pullback in consumer spending, which led to weak performance in global markets, increased unemployment, and significant declines in the values of assets owned by financial institutions. Investors confidence continued to weaken, which caused a shift in the markets from equity and corporate bonds to U.S. treasury notes and bonds. As a result, all three major U.S. equity market indices declined sharply during the fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,(1) NASDAQ Composite Index(2) and the S&P 500(3) were down 38%, 33% and 40%, respectively, for the fiscal year. The Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index(4) increased 3% and the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index(4) decreased 5%. During fiscal 2009, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the discount rate by 2.00% to the current rate of 0.25%. Our results were negatively impacted by many of these factors. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2010. We expect the challenges presented by the credit markets to persist throughout the next fiscal year. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. (1)Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

During fiscal 2009, we eliminated the exposure to SIVs of all liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary by purchasing and subsequently selling, or reimbursing the funds for a portion of the losses they incurred in selling, all securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds and held by us. The majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit or a total return swap ("TRS") prior to the purchase. These transactions, along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than SIVs, resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $2.3 billion. Also, during fiscal 2009, impairment charges of $1.3 billion were recorded, related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division, as a result of declines in the assets under management ("AUM") and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division, and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name. Cash loss from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $2.2 billion, or $15.74 per diluted share, compared to cash income of $412.3 million, or $2.86 per diluted share, in the prior year. These decreases were primarily due to an increase in net losses related to the elimination of SIV exposure, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, of $1.1 billion, or $7.61 per diluted share, and an increase in pre tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion, or $8.25 per diluted share. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to (94.0%) from 9.6% in the prior year. The pretax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to (132.2%) from 13.2% in the prior year. During fiscal 2009, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 66.2 percentage points and 39.0 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 93.1 percentage points and 54.8 percentage points, respectively. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 2008 Beginning of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds: Sales 35.6 38.5 Redemptions (58.3 ) (57.1 ) Separate account flows, net (121.2 ) (13.4 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) 5.7 Net client cash flows (158.9 ) (26.3 ) Market performance(1) (157.7 ) 9.9 Dispositions (1.1 ) (2.0 ) End of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 (1)Includes impact of foreign exchange AUM at March 31, 2009 were $632.4 billion, a decrease of $317.7 billion or 33% from March 31, 2008. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $159 billion and market depreciation of $158 billion, of which approximately 10% was related to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation. There were net client outflows in all asset classes. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $89 billion, or 56% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $47 billion and $23 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset") that have experienced investment performance issues, especially over the last fiscal year. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by key equity products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM") and Permal. Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal 2007. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. In addition, due in part to recent investment performance issues, we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class for the past five quarters. 37 Table of Contents Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. In response to the unprecedented market turmoil, during the December quarter, Permal temporarily modified its redemption notice timing to require 95 day prior notification rather than the historical 20 days. With the objective of returning to the 20 day notice period by January 2010, the current 95 day notice period for redemptions will be reduced to 65 days beginning with the September 30, 2009 redemption date. As of March 31, 2009, Permal had received approximately $2.4 billion of gross redemption notices that, unless withdrawn, will be redeemed in the June quarter. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Equity $ 126.9 20.1 $ 271.6 28.6 (53.3 ) Fixed Income 357.6 56.5 508.2 53.5 (29.6 ) Liquidity 147.9 23.4 170.3 17.9 (13.2 ) Total $ 632.4 100.0 $ 950.1 100.0 (33.4 ) The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2008 $ 271.6 $ 508.2 $ 170.3 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Sales 20.9 14.7 35.6 Redemptions (32.2 ) (26.1 ) (58.3 ) Separate account flows, net (35.3 ) (77.7 ) (8.2 ) (121.2 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (46.6 ) (89.1 ) (23.2 ) (158.9 ) Market performance (97.0 ) (61.5 ) 0.8 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) (1.1 ) March 31, 2009 $ 126.9 $ 357.6 $ 147.9 $ 632.4 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Equity $ 203.2 25.1 $ 327.6 33.1 (38.0 ) Fixed Income 438.0 54.0 498.6 50.3 (12.2 ) Liquidity 169.2 20.9 163.9 16.6 3.2 Total $ 810.4 100.0 $ 990.1 100.0 (18.1 ) 38  Table of Contents AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 446.5 70.6 $ 671.2 70.6 (33.5 ) International 185.9 29.4 278.9 29.4 (33.3 ) Total $ 632.4 100.0 $ 950.1 100.0 (33.4 ) The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2008 $ 671.2 $ 278.9 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Sales 28.3 7.3 35.6 Redemptions (46.4 ) (11.9 ) (58.3 ) Separate account flows, net (84.5 ) (36.7 ) (121.2 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (6.7 ) (8.3 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (109.3 ) (49.6 ) (158.9 ) Market performance (114.3 ) (43.4 ) (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) (1.1 ) March 31, 2009 $ 446.5 $ 185.9 $ 632.4 During April 2009, we estimate that our AUM increased approximately 1% from March 31, 2009 as a result of positive market performance of 4% offset by net client outflows of 3%. These outflows were consistent with March quarter outflows. Equity assets increased 7% partially offset by a decrease in liquidity assets of 1%. Investment Performance(5) Legg Mason is a diversified global asset management company that offers a wide range of investment products. We provide investment services to both retail and institutional clients that span many asset classes, levels of risk, geographic locations and investment styles. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, equity assets accounted for 20% and 29%, respectively, fixed income accounted for 57% and 53%, respectively, and liquidity accounted for the remaining 23% and 18%, respectively, of our assets under management. The past 12 months were characterized by significant volatility with erratic, unprecedented price movements across a variety of markets. The markets have been significantly impacted by the failure of major financial institutions, the freeze in the credit markets and unprecedented government intervention. In addition, the downturn in housing that led the U.S. into a broader slowdown set off financial turmoil that continues. As a result, financial stocks led the equity markets lower, with the S&P 500 Financials Index down 63%, compared to the broader S&P 500 Index, which dropped 38%. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88% of our marketed equity composite(6) assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 53%, 53%, 49%, and 94% of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. (5)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (6)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2009, 85% of our equity assets under management and 84% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. As of March 31, 2008, 86% of our equity assets under management and 83% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. 39 Table of Contents In the fixed income markets, the economic crisis deepened, but the governments numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery, causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the March 2009 quarter. The new fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy, and the governments intention to issue more public debt for financing, caused yields to rise during the quarter. For the 1 year period, Treasury yields have decreased significantly while long term rates have increased resulting in a steeper yield curve. In addition, the worst performing sectors were home equity asset backed securities and investment grade corporate securities as measured by the Barclays ABS Home Equity Index returning (35)% and the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index returning (7)% for the 1 year period. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 4%, 21%, 54%, and 74% of our fixed income marketed composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 41%, 45%, 57%, and 85% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 45%, 50%, 50%, and 91% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 38%, 41%, 45%, and 72% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 33%, 34%, 67%, and 68% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(7) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 2,290.5 68.2 $ 3,217.2 69.4 (28.8 ) International 1,066.9 31.8 1,416.9 30.6 (24.7 ) Total $ 3,357.4 100.0 $ 4,634.1 100.0 (27.6 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by LMCM, ClearBridge and Royce & Associates, LLC ("Royce"), decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), ClearBridge and LMCM and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to a decline in fund revenues and performance fees at Permal, lower separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from International balanced and fixed income funds. (7)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 40 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2009 were $3.4 billion, down 28% from $4.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an 18% decrease in average AUM, due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately 38% and fixed income assets of approximately 12%. The shift in the mix of AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately $115.3 million, or 87%. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $447.3 million, or 31%, to $1.0 billion. Of this decrease, $273.1 million was the result of lower average equity assets at PCM, ClearBridge, LMCM and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC ("Brandywine"), $80.9 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, and $43.9 million was the result of the sale of the Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") business. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the sale. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $483.4 million, or 21%, to $1.8 billion. Of this decrease approximately $450 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at LMCM, ClearBridge, Permal, and Royce, approximately $76 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, offset by approximately $42 million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed, primarily at Western Asset. Performance fees decreased 87%, or $115.3 million, to $17.4 million during fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 31% to $475.0 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds, which resulted in a decrease of $176.7 million. Operating Expenses During the past year, market conditions have contributed to a reduction in our AUM, revenues and earnings. As discussed above, although a significant portion of our expenses are variable and largely increase or decrease proportionately with revenue, a portion of our expenses are fixed and do not decline with reduced revenues. As a result of the substantial decline in revenues during fiscal 2009, certain actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily include reductions in headcount and discretionary incentive compensation in administrative and business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of travel and entertainment costs. These measures, and other less significant actions, have resulted in the elimination of approximately $135 million in costs on an annualized basis, before costs incurred to achieve these savings, such as severance. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2009, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a $341 million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal 2009; the impact of cost savings initiatives, such as reductions in headcount, discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately $86 million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately $59 million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans (which are largely offset by losses in other non operating expense). These decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of $40 million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held SIV issued securities. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to 33.7% from 33.9% in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 24% to $970.0 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 2% to $188.3 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an $11.3 million decrease in 41 Table of Contents technology consulting fees, offset in part by a $4.1 million increase in market data costs for services previously included in Other expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure. Occupancy expense increased 62% to $209.5 million, primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling $70.1 million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of $9.0 million. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 36% to $36.5 million, primarily as a result of the sale of the LMPPG business, which reduced amortization expense by $10.6 million, and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year 2008, which reduced amortization expense by $6.6 million. Impairment charges increased to $1.3 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division. The remaining $146 million relates to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and a related trade name. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $27.8 million to $182.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of $11.4 million, lower professional fees of $7.2 million and lower advertising costs of $5.4 million. In addition, the sale of the LMPPG overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately $5 million. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 will continue to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009. In addition, we have planned and are in the process of implementing additional cost reductions to bring the total amount to $160 million on an annualized basis by September 30, 2009. However, our business is dynamic and requires us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business. For example, operating expenses in fiscal 2010 will reflect incremental costs of approximately $10 million associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters. In addition, from time to time we fill key positions and take actions to retain key talent that would require additional compensation. As discussed above, during fiscal 2010, we will relocate our corporate headquarters. We are currently pursuing sub tenants for certain floors under lease that will be unoccupied as a result of headcount reductions. Given the current commercial real estate market, at the time we secure a sub lease or the space is deemed to be permanently abandoned, we will likely recognize a charge for the present value of the amount by which our commitment under our lease exceeds the amount due to us under the expected sub lease terms. However, subsequent to any such charge, occupancy expense will be reduced by the amount of our lease costs attributable to the sublet floors. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 27% to $56.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances, which decreased interest income by $42.1 million, offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt, which increased interest income by $25.3 million. Interest expense increased 82% to $150.5 million as a result of higher debt levels. We raised $1.15 billion in May 2008 by issuing Equity Units, and $1.25 billion by issuing 2.5% convertible senior notes in January 2008, which resulted in an increase of approximately $83.1 million in interest expense. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of $425 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes in July 2008 and lower interest rates paid on our term loan, which together resulted in a decrease of $28.6 million. During fiscal 2010, interest expense will increase by $32.3 million as a result of the adoption of FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. APB 14 1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)", related to our 2.5% convertible senior notes. See Other Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this FSP. Fund support losses increased $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of continued SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to 42 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $116.0 million to a loss of $109.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $58.3 million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above, and $33.1 million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit was $1.2 billion compared to income tax expense of $176.0 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 38.4% in the current year compared to a 39.7% provision in the prior year. The current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits. In addition, the current year includes approximately $80 million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary, offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income from Continuing Operations As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "cash income from continuing operations" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason. We define "cash income from continuing operations" as income (loss) from continuing operations, plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment. We believe that cash income (loss) from continuing operations provides a good representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and it facilitates comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments. We also believe that cash income (loss) from continuing operations is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. This measure is provided in addition to income from continuing operations, but is not a substitute for income from continuing operations and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income from continuing operations is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider cash income from continuing operations to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value and because it facilitates comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. In calculating cash income from continuing operations, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to income from continuing operations to reflect the fact that this non cash expense makes it difficult to compare our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill over time, we add them to income in the calculation of cash income from continuing operations. Conversely, we subtract income taxes on these impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. Should a disposition or impairment charge occur on indefinite life intangible assets or goodwill, its impact on cash income from continuing operations may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor changes in indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill and the related impact, including taxes, on cash income from continuing operations to ensure appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany disclosures of cash income from continuing operations. Although depreciation and amortization on fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income from continuing operations because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 43 Table of Contents A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ (1,947,928 ) $ 267,610 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 36,488 57,271 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 142,494 143,600 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) (56,187 ) Cash Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations $ (2,213,564 ) $ 412,294 Cash Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations per diluted share $ (13.85 ) $ 1.86 Amortization of intangible assets 0.26 0.40 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 1.01 0.99 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) (0.39 ) Cash Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share $ (15.74 ) $ 2.86 The decrease in cash income from continuing operations was primarily due to an increase in pre tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion, or $8.25 per diluted share, and an increase in net losses related to the elimination of SIV exposure of $1.1 billion, or $7.61 per diluted share. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted We believe that pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense is a useful measure of our performance because it indicates what our margins would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, and thus shows the effect of these revenues on our margins. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margin under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 3,357,367 $ 4,634,086 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 969,964 1,273,986 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 2,387,403 $ 3,360,100 Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision (Benefit) and Minority Interests $ (3,155,857 ) $ 443,871 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis (94.0 )% 9.6 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted (132.2 ) 13.2 During fiscal 2009, losses related to liquidity fund support and impairment charges reduced the pre tax profit margin by 66.2 percentage points and 39.0 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 93.1 percentage points and 54.8 percentage points, respectively. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of management contracts reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. 44  Table of Contents FISCAL 2008 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2007 Financial Overview During fiscal 2008, we entered into several transactions to provide support to certain liquidity funds that held securities issued by SIVs that are managed by a subsidiary. These transactions resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $607.3 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, an impairment charge of $151.0 million was recorded for a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 totaled $267.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, a decrease of 59% and 58%, respectively, from the prior year. Cash income from continuing operations (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $412.3 million, or $2.86 per diluted share, each representing a decrease of 51% from the prior year. These decreases were primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the pre tax impairment charge of $151.0 million, or $1.05 per diluted share. The pre tax profit margin from continuing operations declined to 9.6% from 24.0% in the prior year. The pretax profit margin from continuing operations, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), declined to 13.2% from 33.2% in the prior year. During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment charge reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 2007 Beginning of period $ 968.5 $ 867.6 Net client cash flows (26.3 ) 44.2 Market performance 9.9 57.5 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (2.0 ) (0.8 ) End of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 AUM at March 31, 2008 were $950.1 billion, a decrease of $18.4 billion or 2% from March 31, 2007. Net client cash outflows for the fiscal year were $26.3 billion and were driven by outflows in equity assets of approximately $44 billion, resulting, in part, from lower relative investment performance, partially offset by approximately $15 billion and $3 billion of fixed income and liquidity inflows, respectively. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Equity $ 271.6 28.6 $ 338.0 34.9 (19.6 ) Fixed Income 508.2 53.5 470.9 48.6 7.9 Liquidity 170.3 17.9 159.6 16.5 6.7 Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Equity $ 327.6 33.1 $ 325.1 35.9 0.8 Fixed Income 498.6 50.3 441.9 48.8 12.8 Liquidity 163.9 16.6 138.8 15.3 18.1 Total $ 990.1 100.0 $ 905.8 100.0 9.3 45 Table of Contents AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Americas $ 671.2 70.6 $ 693.8 71.6 (3.3 ) International 278.9 29.4 274.7 28.4 1.5 Total $ 950.1 100.0 $ 968.5 100.0 (1.9 ) The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2008 were as follows: Americas International Total AUM March 31, 2007 $ 693.8 $ 274.7 $ 968.5 Net client cash flows (8.7 ) (17.6 ) (26.3 ) Market performance (12.6 ) 22.5 9.9 Acquisitions (dispositions), net (1.3 ) (0.7 ) (2.0 ) March 31, 2008 $ 671.2 $ 278.9 $ 950.1 Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change Americas $ 3,217.2 69.4 $ 3,169.4 73.0 1.5 International 1,416.9 30.6 1,174.3 27.0 20.7 Total $ 4,634.1 100.0 $ 4,343.7 100.0 6.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and Royce and increased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and Brandywine. These were partially offset by decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by PCM, decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The increase in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to increased fund revenues at Permal and Legg Mason Poland. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Revenues from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2008 were $4.6 billion, up 7% from $4.3 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 9% increase in average AUM, principally in the liquidity and fixed income asset classes. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased 1%, or $18.7 million, to $1.46 billion, primarily as a result of higher average assets managed by Western Asset, Brandywine and Batterymarch Financial Management Inc., offset in part by a decline in advisory fees due to lower average assets managed by PCM and ClearBridge. Investment advisory fees from funds increased 15% to $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets managed by Permal, Western Asset and Royce. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average assets managed by ClearBridge. Performance fees decreased 7%, or $9.5 million, to $132.7 million during fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of decreases in performance fees earned by Western Asset, and LMCM, which were partially offset by an increase in performance fees earned by Permal. 46 Table of Contents Distribution and service fees decreased 3% to $692.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic equity funds. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits remained flat at $1.6 billion, as increased revenue share based incentive expense on higher revenues along with higher salary and benefits at certain of our subsidiaries were substantially offset by incentive expense reductions related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that hold SIV issued securities. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges related to our liquidity business. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues was 33.9% for fiscal 2008, down from 36.1% for fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of a reduction in compensation resulting from adjustments related to liquidity fund support. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 7% to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased average AUM at Permal and in liquidity assets for which we pay higher relative fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense increased 11% to $192.8 million, primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense, technology maintenance, and other expenditures related to investment management and business continuity infrastructure and office relocations. Occupancy expense increased 29% to $129.4 million, primarily as a result of higher rent at new office locations and the impact of duplicate rent on facilities during relocation periods. Expense for impairment of management contracts was $151.0 million, related to the impairment of certain acquired management contracts as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition than previously estimated. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of management contracts. Other operating expenses increased 1% to $209.9 million, driven primarily by increased promotional expenses, offset in part by decreased expenses under a transition services agreement with Citigroup related to the integration of businesses acquired from Citigroup and prior year losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets as a result of office relocations. Other Income (Expense) Interest income increased $18.0 million to $76.9 million, primarily as a result of higher average firm investment account balances, offset in part by a decline in average interest rates earned on these balances. Interest expense increased $11.2 million to $82.7 million due to $500 million of new borrowings under our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the issuance of $1.25 billion of convertible senior notes in January 2008, offset in part by $150 million of principal reduction made on our $700 million term loan. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $628.7 million to a loss of $600.5 million, primarily as a result of losses related to liquidity fund support of approximately $607.3 million, which excludes $1.0 million of financing costs included in interest expense. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes decreased 56% to $176.0 million, primarily as a result of lower earnings due to losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of acquired management contract assets recorded during fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate increased to 39.7% from 38.1% in the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in earnings in higher state income tax rate jurisdictions as a result of the impairment and liquidity fund support charges at lower relative state income tax rates. 47 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income from Continuing Operations A reconciliation of income from continuing operations to cash income from continuing operations (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Income from Continuing Operations $ 267,610 $ 646,246 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 57,271 68,410 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 143,600 130,758 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (56,187 ) Cash Income from Continuing Operations $ 412,294 $ 845,414 Cash Income per Diluted Share Income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 1.86 $ 4.48 Amortization of intangible assets 0.40 0.47 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.99 0.91 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (0.39 ) Cash Income per Diluted Share $ 2.86 $ 5.86 The decrease in cash income from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to net losses related to liquidity fund support of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and the impairment of management contracts, net of income tax benefits, of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. Pre tax Profit Margin from Continuing Operations, as Adjusted A reconciliation of pre tax profit margin from continuing operations adjusted for distribution and servicing expense (in thousands) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 4,634,086 $ 4,343,675 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 1,273,986 1,196,019 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 3,360,100 $ 3,147,656 Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Provision and Minority Interests $ 443,871 $ 1,043,854 Pre tax profit margin, GAAP basis 9.6 % 24.0 % Pre tax profit margin, as adjusted 13.2 33.2 During fiscal 2008, losses related to liquidity fund support and the impairment of management contracts reduced the pre tax profit margin by 11.0 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, and reduced the pre tax profit margin, as adjusted, by 15.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. 48 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary objective of our capital structure and funding practices is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. During fiscal 2008 and 2009, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that had invested in asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by SIVs. These arrangements are described in the Liquidity Fund Support section below. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. In order to ensure adequate resources for the liquidity fund support transactions as well as for general corporate purposes, we increased our capital base by $1.15 billion through the issuance of Equity Units during fiscal 2009. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents, refundable income taxes, investment advisory and related fee receivables and investment securities. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of our ongoing operations. At March 31, 2009, our cash, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.1 billion, $9.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash flows from operating activities $ 437.9 $ 1,144.3 $ 905.4 Cash flows used for investing activities (1,090.9 ) (2,103.3 ) (542.1 ) Cash flows from (used for) financing activities 301.1 1,220.6 (209.4 ) Effect of exchange rate changes (27.2 ) 18.4 6.2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (379.1 ) 280.0 160.1 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,463.6 1,183.6 1,023.5 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,084.5 $ 1,463.6 $ 1,183.6 Cash flows from operating activities were $437.9 million during fiscal 2009 compared to cash flows of $1,144.3 million for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in operating cash flows is primarily due to lower earnings driven by AUM and revenue declines in the current year. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2009 were $1.1 billion, primarily attributable to the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds, which used $2.9 billion, including $801.8 million of net cash collateral returned upon termination of associated support agreements. As discussed below, the liquidity fund support payments were funded in part with a portion of the proceeds of two debt issuances during calendar year 2008. The outflows were offset, in part, by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and SIV securities of $604.6 million and $513.9 million, respectively, cash proceeds of $181.1 million received for the sale of LMPPG and the return of a portion of a contingent earnout payment from the PCM acquisition of $120.0 million that was previously funded into escrow. Cash flows from financing activities provided $301.1 million, primarily due to the $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the offering of Equity Units in May, offset in part by the repayment of the $425 million 6.75% senior notes in July and the $250 million repayment on our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2009. A portion of the proceeds of the Equity Units offering and a $1.25 billion offering of convertible senior notes in January 2008 has been used to help fund the liquidity fund support and the senior notes repayment discussed above. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid cash dividends of $135.9 million, $132.8 million, and $109.9 million, respectively. On May 5, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share, representing a quarterly reduction of $0.21 per share from our prior dividend. 49 Table of Contents We expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. During the past year, difficult market conditions have contributed to a reduction in our AUM and revenues and resulted in a reduction in the cash generated by our operations, which is our primary source of added liquidity. If this trend continues, we would expect that the available cash generated by our operations would continue to decrease. However, in an effort to mitigate the effects of declining market conditions and lower revenue levels, we have reduced our corporate expenses by approximately $135 million on an annualized basis as of March 31, 2009, excluding costs to achieve these savings, such as severance, and have planned additional reductions of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2010. In addition, we also expect to receive approximately $600 million in tax refunds in fiscal 2010, primarily attributable to the carry back tax benefit on the realized losses incurred on the sale of SIV securities. These refunds are expected to be received in the next six months. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to replenish funds used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. We anticipate repatriating additional amounts starting in fiscal year 2010, although timing is currently uncertain. Any repatriated amounts will effectively increase our available cash. In addition to our ordinary operating cash needs, as discussed above, we anticipate several other cash needs during the next twelve months. In November 2009, we may be required to pay up to $286 million under the agreements governing the Permal acquisition, with the amount of the payment to be determined based on Permals operating results. The final payment for this transaction in November 2011 will be between $60 million and $320 million based on Permals results and the amount of the fiscal 2010 payment. We may pay up to 25% of each of these payments in shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we will move into a new corporate headquarters and expect to incur total costs for the new building of approximately $92 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and furniture, of which approximately $44 million was paid during the year ended March 31, 2009. As discussed below, if our earnings remain at current levels, we would expect to repay a portion of our bank debt by December 2009. We may also elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repayment of outstanding debt, or acquisitions. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If this were to occur, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. However, current market conditions would make it difficult to raise additional capital, and would increase the costs of doing so. In addition, our debt covenants currently prevent us from incurring more than $250 million in additional indebtedness. 50  Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2009: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Face Amount Type 2009 2008 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 1,150,000 1,150,000 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 500,000 LIBOR + 2.25% October 2010 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 550,000 LIBOR + 2.25% October 2010 6.75% Senior Notes 425,000 424,959 6.75% July 2008 In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% senior notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion are being used for general corporate purposes, which to date has primarily included the purchase of SIV securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. This transaction closed on January 31, 2008. We used approximately $180 million of the capital raised to purchase and retire preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. This facility matures on October 14, 2010, may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. On January 3, 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 4, 2008, we elected to procure a letter of credit ("LOC") to support up to $150 million of certain SIV issued holdings in a liquidity fund under this facility. See discussion on liquidity fund support below. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from $1 billion to $500 million and further modified covenants, as discussed below. On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Citigroups asset management business ("CAM") in exchange for (i) all outstanding stock of our subsidiaries that constituted our Private Client and Capital Markets businesses; (ii) 5,393,545 shares of common stock and 13.346632 shares of our non voting convertible preferred stock, which is convertible, upon transfer, into 13,346,632 shares of common stock; and (iii) $512 million in cash borrowed under a $700 million five year syndicated term loan facility. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a post closing purchase price adjustment of $84.7 million to Citigroup in September 2006, based on the retention of certain AUM nine months after the closing. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately .36 million and 5.53 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately .36 and 5.53 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the CAM acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash. 51 Table of Contents In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap ("Swap") to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this Swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The outstanding balance under this facility was $550 million at March 31, 2009 and the Swap fully matured in December 2008. Also in connection with the Citigroup transaction, one of our subsidiaries borrowed $83.2 million under a 364 day promissory note. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we paid from available cash the balance outstanding on this note. Included in outstanding debt as of March 31, 2008 is $425 million principal amount of senior notes due July 2, 2008, which bear interest at 6.75%. The notes were issued at a discount to yield 6.80%. The accreted balance of $425 million was repaid from available cash in July 2008. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. The May 2008 issuance of Equity Units resulted in our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeding that limit, although we received a waiver of the covenant to allow us to complete the transaction. The waiver prevents us from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. The sales of SIV securities during fiscal year 2009 reduced our EBITDA under the definition, thus further increasing our ratio for purposes of this covenant. As a result of these two events, we may not, subject to a few limited exceptions, incur more than $250 million in new indebtedness until the effects of the sales of SIV securities is no longer in the trailing twelve month EBITDA calculation and when we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness. Our $500 million revolving line of credit, as revised, of which $250 million is currently outstanding, and our $550 million term loan also contain financial covenants. These covenants include: maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. The maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was increased from 2.5 to 3.0 in a November 2008 amendment. In March 2009, the maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was revised to allow us to reduce includable debt by unrestricted cash in excess of up to $500 million in working capital. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, any non cash charges and up to $3.0 billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support. As of March 31, 2009, Legg Masons debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 6.2, and therefore Legg Mason is in compliance with these covenants. If our net income remains at current levels or further declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, use available cash to repay all or a portion of our $800 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. Based on March run rate EBITDA, and factoring projected cost savings, we would be required to repay over half of our outstanding bank debt by December 2009 to maintain compliance with our covenants. However, based on improved April run rate results, repayment of debt may not be required to maintain compliance with our covenants. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay all or a portion of our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by all three rating agencies that follow us: Moodys Investor Services ("Moodys"), Standard and Poors Rating Services ("Standard and Poors"), and Fitch Ratings. Our current Moodys rating is A3 with a 52 Table of Contents negative outlook. Our current Standard and Poors rating is BBB+ with a negative outlook and our current Fitch rating is A with a negative outlook. In the event of a one level downgrade by Moodys or Standard and Poors, the interest rate on our five year term loan and revolving line of credit will increase by 0.25% per annum. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We have the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right is not exercised, the holders of those equity interests have the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, representing earnout payments based upon Permals revenues through the second anniversary date and the purchase of 37.5% of the preference shares, of which $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in our common stock. It is anticipated that we will acquire the remaining 62.5% of the preference shares in fiscal 2010 at amounts based on Permals revenues, at which time we may be required to pay up to $286 million under the agreements governing the Permal acquisition. The final payment for this transaction on the sixth anniversary in fiscal 2012 will be between $60 million and $320 million based on Permals revenues and the amount of the fiscal 2010 payment. We may elect to deliver up to 25% of each of the future payments in the form of shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid an aggregate amount of approximately $31.5 million in dividends on the preference shares, and we will pay a minimum of $7.5 million in dividends on the preference shares in fiscal 2010. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, are recognized as additional goodwill. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors previously authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. On July 19, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4 million shares of common stock from the proceeds from the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2009 and 2007. Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. 53 Table of Contents Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: 2009 2008 Earliest Transaction Date Description Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Letters of Credit(2) November 2007 $ $ $ 335,000 $286,250 Capital Support Agreement(3) November 2007 15,000 15,000 Purchase of Canadian Conduit Securities(4) December 2007 94,000 Total Return Swap(3) December 2007 890,000 139,480 Purchase of Non bank Sponsored SIVs(3,5) December 2007 82,000 Letter of Credit(6) March 2008 150,000 Capital Support Agreements(6) March 2008 400,000 400,000 Capital Support Agreements(7) September 2008 34,500 34,500 Capital Support Agreements(3) October 2008 7,000 7,000 Total $ 41,500 $ 41,500 $ 1,966,000 $840,730 (1)Included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (2)Pertains to Citi Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C.

(Euro Fund) and Citi Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Sterling Fund) During fiscal 2008, we entered into arrangements with two third party banks to provide LOCs for an aggregate amount of approximately $485 million for the benefit of three liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support four of these agreements, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. Additionally, one of the arrangements was supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2009, these LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $286 million in collateral was returned. During fiscal 2008, we entered into six capital support agreements ("CSAs"). Under the terms of the CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $415 million in support to two liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $415 million in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. During fiscal 2009, $200 million in principal amount of securities supported by one of these CSAs matured and were paid in full. The related CSA terminated in accordance with its terms and collateral of $15 million was returned. The remaining CSAs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the remaining $400 million in collateral was returned. Also during fiscal year 2008, we entered into a TRS arrangement with a major bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which the Bank purchased securities issued by three SIVs from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund managed by one of our subsidiaries. The $890 million in face amount of commercial paper was purchased by the Bank 54 Table of Contents for cash at an aggregate amount of $832 million, which represents an estimate of value determined for collateral purposes. In addition, we reimbursed the fund for the $59.5 million difference between the funds carrying value, including accrued interest, and the amount paid and provided $139.5 million in cash collateral, which under the terms of the agreements could be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. During fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to two liquidity funds in the form of two standby letters of credit in the total amount of approximately $257 million. We provided collateral equal to the total support amount under the LOCs. These LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the $257 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we entered into and amended various capital support agreements. Under the terms of the new and amended CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $1.07 billion in support to particular liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $1.07 billion in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. CSAs aggregating $1.03 billion terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $1.03 billion of collateral was returned. Contributions made under any of our CSAs will not result in our acquiring an ownership or other interest in the fund. The four CSAs remaining at March 31, 2009 include a recovery clause in which the funds are required to reimburse us for all contributions made upon the expiration of the CSA to the extent that the funds subsequently receive payments from the issuer of the underlying securities or upon the sale or other disposition thereof that exceed the amortized cost of the underlying securities at the time the amounts are paid under the CSAs. During fiscal 2009, $440 million in principal amount of securities previously supported under the TRS arrangement matured and were paid in full and an additional $95 million in principal amount of securities under the TRS arrangement was repaid. Also during fiscal 2009, non bank sponsored SIV securities purchased from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund in fiscal 2008 matured and $82 million in principal amount and interest was paid in full. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from six liquidity funds that were previously supported under twelve CSAs and seven LOCs. Upon the purchase of these securities, the twelve CSAs aggregating $1.4 billion and seven LOCs aggregating $742 million were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which includes the return of $1.03 billion and $257 million of collateral provided during the current fiscal year to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs, respectively. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by the TRS and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. Our four remaining CSAs to provide an aggregate $42 million of support for investments in non SIV securities to certain funds expire on or before March 31, 2010. If the funds continue to hold the underlying securities and market conditions have not improved when the agreements expire, we will likely be required to utilize cash to address our obligations under these support arrangements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future 55 Table of Contents effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments section that follows and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Notes 1, 16 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, most of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2009, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS, which are fully described above and in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Payments We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. In addition, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, we have made or expect to make contingent payments under business purchase agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual and contingent obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 8.2 553.8 2.6 1.1 0.9 2,406.8 2,973.4 Coupon interest on short term and long term borrowings(2) 135.5 122.1 112.3 112.2 112.2 615.5 1,209.8 Minimum rental and service commitments 161.5 110.8 102.2 94.2 87.6 674.3 1,230.6 Minimum commitments under capital leases(3) 31.3 2.4 1.9 35.6 Total Contractual Obligations 586.5 789.1 219.0 207.5 200.7 3,696.6 5,699.4 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(4) 293.5 60.0 353.5 Capital support(5) 41.5 41.5 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(6,7) $ 921.5 $ 789.1 $ 279.0 $ 207.5 $ 200.7 $ 3,696.6 $ 6,094.4 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until October 2010.

(4)The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of business purchase agreements. (5)The amount of contingent obligations under capital support agreements represents the maximum amount that could be payable at any time up through the contracts termination dates. (6)The table above does not include approximately $29.5 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a general or limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal 2011. (7)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $35.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. 56  Table of Contents MARKET RISK A risk management committee oversees and coordinates risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. In addition, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. Beginning in November 2007, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds. These arrangements included LOCs, CSAs, a TRS arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or the funds sold, all remaining securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure. Prior to the purchase, the majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit and a TRS. The various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. As of March 31, 2009, four CSAs to provide up to a maximum of $41.5 million in support of net asset values of four funds, with underlying investments in over $1.8 billion in non asset backed securities, remain outstanding. During April 2009, one of the CSAs representing $7.0 million of the $41.5 million terminated while incurring no loss. These fund support arrangements and the related risks are discussed below. Trading investments at March 31, 2009 and 2008 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2009 2008 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 128,785 $ 207,305 Proprietary fund products and other investments 207,307 140,267 Securities issued by SIVs 141,509 Total trading investments $ 336,092 $ 489,081 Approximately $119.0 million and $169.8 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income. Other trading investments of $9.8 million and $37.5 million at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. 57 Table of Contents Approximately $207.3 million and $140.3 million of trading assets at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $46.3 million and $67.4 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements and the fluctuations in market value of approximately $16.6 million as of March 31, 2009 is related to minority interest of consolidated investment funds. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. The remaining trading assets at March 31, 2008 include $141.5 million in investments issued by SIVs acquired from liquidity funds a subsidiary manages, of which $82.0 million matured and was paid in full in May 2008. The fair value of these trading assets fluctuated with market changes and impacted our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2009, all securities issued by SIVs were sold. Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2009 and 2008 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2009 2008 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 6,818 $ 7,700 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 59,515 81,703 Other investments 1,423 1,323 Total non trading investments 67,756 90,726 Derivative assets: Total return swap 45,706 Total non trading assets $ 67,756 $ 136,432 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ 20,631 $ 551,654 As previously discussed, by March 31, 2009, we effectively eliminated our exposure to SIVs. As of March 31, 2009, we recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $20.6 million, for which our exposure was limited to approximately $41.5 million. After the termination of one of the fund support arrangements in April 2009 for $7.0 million, our current exposure and additional potential losses on supported securities are $34.5 million and $13.9 million, respectively. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." The elimination of SIV exposure from our Balance Sheet and money market funds as of March 31, 2009 substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk. See Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. 58 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2009: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease Trading investments: Investment related to deferred compensation plans $ 128,785 $ 154,542 $ 103,028 Proprietary fund products and other 207,307 248,768 165,846 Total trading investment(1) 336,092 403,310 268,874 Available for sale investments 6,818 8,180 5,454 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 59,515 71,418 47,612 Other investments 1,423 1,708 1,138 Total investments subject to market risk $ 403,848 $ 484,616 $ 323,078 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ 20,631 $ 16,505 $ 24,757 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability, or minority interest. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $40.8 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings, respectively, as of March 31, 2009. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, the United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, and Japan, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $806 million and $1,061 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2009, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $8.1 million. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market 59 Table of Contents value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2009, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $126.9 billion, $357.6 billion, and $147.9 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. The recent economic events and financial market declines have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2009, less than 2% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. 60 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualify as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments are based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which support investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of $20.6 million was included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No derivative asset was recorded as of March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2008, we had $45.7 million of derivative assets included in Other current assets and $551.7 million of derivative liabilities included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exposure on these derivative instruments was based on the underlying securities values and related gains and losses may vary significantly in relation to their recorded balances. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2009 and 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, we owned approximately $42.2 million and $156.6 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2009 and 2008, we also have approximately $59.5 million and $81.7 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method. Effective April 1, 2008, we adopted Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and increases disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Under SFAS 157, a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. SFAS 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which: prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to fund support arrangements and investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions. 61  Table of Contents The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products are valued at net asset value ("NAV") determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. Our liquidity fund support has taken the form of CSAs, LOCs, a TRS arrangement and purchases of securities from funds as more fully described in Note 17. The CSAs, LOCs, and TRS arrangement are considered derivative assets or liabilities for accounting purposes representing the Companys rights and obligations under the support, the fair value of which is based principally on the value of the underlying securities. Substantially all of the underlying securities supported and all of the securities purchased from liquidity funds were issued by SIVs and had no active market such that fair value was determined based on an evaluation of the issuer trust and its underlying collateral, which are primarily comprised of asset and mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds, and collateralized debt obligations. These instruments may or may not have financial guaranty insurance. Of the total SIV securities we owned or supported in liquidity funds prior to the sale of SIV securities, over 60% of the underlying trust collateral securities were valued based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data; over 35% of the collateral securities were valued based on spreads to benchmark debt instruments with available prices; and less than 5% of the collateral values were based on broker quotes. All security prices, including prices for underlying trust collateral securities, whether direct market quotes, adjusted comparable security prices, or broker quotes, are subject to internal analyses that consider market observations, broker quotes and other tests to substantiate their fair values. Broker quotes used are indicative but not firm or tradable bids. Exclusive of these internal analytics, we generally do not obtain more than one price per instrument, unless we are relying on broker quotes, where we generally seek to use an average of at least two quotes. The prices utilized for underlying trust collateral securities incorporated both non performance and liquidity risks inherent in these securities and there were no further considerations of credit risk necessary relating to the trust or the issuers of the SIVs. In estimating the fair values for SIV related financial assets and liabilities (both securities owned and fund support derivatives) we assumed the value of the related SIV security equaled its percentage share of the sum of the values of the underlying collateral securities plus cash and other assets held by the trust, net of reported trust liabilities. In following this valuation approach, we assume that the SIV trust will distribute to holders all income and other returns received from the collateral securities. When no direct price for a particular collateral security is available, the price is based upon a review of available information, including prices for securities we believe are comparable. We use professional judgment to consider adjustments where appropriate including, for example, based on the nature of the collateral and its issue date. While these determinations may reflect, in whole or part, market observations, they are inherently subjective and it is not possible to further quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. Our credit risk is not a material factor to the fair value of the related derivative liabilities because, among other things, the majority of our liquidity fund support required cash collateral and we had available cash to cover uncollateralized positions. These valuation processes for supported or purchased SIV issued securities inherently required managements judgment and therefore the related assets and liabilities were classified in Level 3. Market changes affecting the underlying collateral are a primary contributor to changes in the fair values of the liquidity fund support assets and liabilities and the related gains and losses. As of March 31, 2009, approximately 1% of total assets and less than 1% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 62 Table of Contents Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2009 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 88,243 $ 11,797 $ 100,040 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,541,557 1,211,404 3,752,961 Trade names 69,800 69,800 Goodwill 907,078 279,669 1,186,747 $ 3,606,678 $ 1,502,870 $ 5,109,548 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform detail tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these detail tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not 63 Table of Contents appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Management contract intangible assets related to retail separately managed accounts sold through broker dealer sponsored programs acquired in the CAM transaction ("CAM management contracts") represented approximately $128.3 million or 69% of our total net amortizable intangible assets as of December 31, 2008, with a remaining life of approximately 9 years. However, we have experienced a recent trend of increased client outflows associated with these contracts. In addition, changes at the primary underlying program sponsor announced during the March quarter are expected to contribute further to this trend. The combination of these events has caused us to reduce the remaining expected life by approximately 40% to 5 years. The impact of reduced AUM levels, combined with the shorter expected life (recovery period), has resulted in our cumulative expected future cash flows to fall below the carrying value of the asset. On a discounted cash flow basis, this resulted in an impairment charge of $72 million. After the impairment charge, the CAM management contracts represent approximately $52 million or 52% of our total net amortizable intangible assets. As a result of significant client attrition, related declines in AUM and the associated revised estimate of remaining useful lives, our evaluation during fiscal 2009 of PCMs asset management contracts indicated the carrying value would not be fully recoverable. Based upon projected cash flows on remaining acquired contracts, discounted at a rate of 14.8%, the value of contracts was determined to be impaired and we recognized charges for the remaining book value totaling $26.6 million in fiscal 2009. Current cash flow projections were significantly lower than previous projections as a result of continued AUM outflows and decreased market value resulting in part from the recent severe market declines. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 9 years with a weighted average life of approximately 5 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and to a lesser extent, trade names. The discounted projected cash flows used to value intangible assets take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates, which includes estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If such impairment exists, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the CAM acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. As a result of the dramatic changes in market conditions during the fiscal year, we revised our growth assumptions downward, to project contraction to minimal growth for the domestic mutual fund contracts and contraction for the Permal contracts through the next two years. Cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 4.0%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 7.5% thereafter. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 2.5%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 8.0% thereafter. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, 64 Table of Contents including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual funds and Permal funds are discounted at 13.7% and 14.7%, respectively. Changes in assumptions, such as an increased discount rate or declining cash flows, could result in impairment. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 16% and 20%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15% and 17%, respectively, for the assets to be deemed impaired. With continued deterioration in the markets or other unfavorable factors, it is reasonably possible that actual cash flows from either or both the domestic mutual fund or Permal fund contracts could deviate from projections by more than 16% and 20%, respectively. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $480.3 million and $240.0 million, respectively. Trade names account for less than 2% of indefinite life intangible assets. The significant decrease in PCMs assets under management and related cash flows generated assessed values that resulted in full impairment of the $47 million PCM trade name asset during fiscal 2009. The assessment of this trade name fair value was based on a discounted cash flow model applying an after tax royalty rate to PCMs expected future revenues, using a discount rate of 14.8% and long term annual growth of 5%. Although the discounted cash flow model resulted in an immaterial assessed value, based on other qualitative factors, we believed the remaining amount was impaired. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted at 14.0% and 14.5%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of March 31, 2009, the implied fair values exceed the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, are assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 4%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 10%. Projected cash 65 Table of Contents flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division are assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 6%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 10%. Cash flow growth of 4% and 6% for Americas and International, respectively, over the next five years is based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections are based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods, in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business. On a combined basis for both equity and fixed income product types, these projections rely on an expectation that markets relevant to these products will stabilize with some rebalancing from fixed income to equity products during fiscal 2010. Long term growth of 10% for both divisions is based on our historical experience and available historic market statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 42% and 34%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 5 and 4 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. Under our prior management structure and related reporting units of Managed Investments, Institutional and Wealth Management, we recognized an impairment charge of $1,161,900 for the Wealth Management division during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The severe market turmoil experienced during the December quarter had a more significant impact on the Wealth Management division than on our other divisions. AUM in that division decreased over 30% as a result of both net client outflows and market depreciation. As a result of the dramatic changes in market conditions during the December quarter, growth assumptions were revised downward, to project contraction through the next two years. Further, the applicable discount rate was increased from 12.5% to 14.7% based on changes in interest rates and market risk factors. The combined impact of these factors decreased projected cash flows of the Wealth Management division by over 60% from our prior projections resulting in the impairment charge. Prior to the impairment charge, the majority of the goodwill of this division arose from the acquisition of PCM. Projected cash flows for the Wealth Management division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 3.0%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 8.0% compared to prior average growth rates of 7.3% and 10.0%, respectively. Growth of 3% over the next five years was based on the current market conditions, our past experience, market statistics and prospects of each of our more significant managers in this division. These projections relied on the expectation that markets relevant to products in this division will stabilize by fiscal 2011. Actual results will invariably differ from our assumptions, the impact of which could be material to the financial statements. Goodwill is the residual value of a reporting unit after all other identifiable assets in that reporting unit have been valued, including management contract intangible assets. If goodwill has been determined to be impaired, variances in assumptions that impact the value of the reporting unit will generally also impact the values of identifiable assets within the reporting unit before, and to a greater extent than, they impact goodwill. For example, if our growth assumptions for the Wealth Management Division and all its related intangible assets were decreased for all periods by 1%, the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the division would have increased by less than 2%, because the other intangible assets within the division would have correspondingly decreased in value. Likewise, if the discount rate for the Wealth Management Division and all its related intangible assets had been 15.7% (1 percentage point higher), the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the division would have increased by less than 2%. As indicated above, we performed our annual assessment of goodwill as of December 31. However, given the restructuring of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we reassessed the fair values of our former reporting units as of March 31, 2009, the results of which indicated the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. As of March 31, 2009, considering relevant prices of Legg Masons common shares and based on dilutive shares outstanding, inclusive of shares issuable under Equity Units, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, approximates its carrying value. In an 66 Table of Contents acquisition, there is typically a premium paid over current market prices of publicly traded companies that relates to the ability to control the operations of an acquired company. Recent market evidence regarding this control factor suggests premiums of 30% to 45% and higher as realistic and common, and Legg Mason believes such premiums to be a reasonable estimation for our equity value. Our market evidence is from a published source and included 150 transactions from the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Although there is limited transaction data subsequent to September 30, 2008, more recent transactions support or exceed the high end of our range. We exclude consideration of transactions with unique circumstances and find that transaction values for asset management firms relative to their respective book values do not vary significantly from relative transaction values in other industries. Continued disruption and depressed financial markets will further increase the potential for impairment of our goodwill and or other intangible asset carrying values. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to officers and key employees. During fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share Based Payment" and related pronouncements using the modified prospective method and the related transition election. Under this method, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under SFAS No. 123 (R), cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 1.5 million, 0.9 million, and 1.0 million stock options, including grants to non employee directors, in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. 67 Table of Contents Substantially all of Legg Masons deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. Although Legg Mason has been historically profitable, the current year SIV losses resulted in a U.S. tax loss for fiscal 2009. We believe SIV losses incurred on liquidity fund guarantees are unique and isolated. Therefore, any analysis of Legg Masons core U.S. earnings expected to recur in the future should exclude incurred SIV losses. As of March 31, 2009, U.S. deferred tax assets accumulated $1.3 billion, realization of which is expected to require $5.7 billion of future U.S. earnings. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2009, U.K. deferred tax assets are not material. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. Included in Refundable income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2009 is $603 million in tax refunds expected during fiscal year 2010, of which $275 million, $271 million and $57 million, relates to net operating and capital loss carrybacks and other refunds, respectively. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level 68 Table of Contents of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.
