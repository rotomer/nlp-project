MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management. We manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. Our division management reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer. The Americas division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. We believe this structure provides greater focus and allows us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset 32 Table of Contents management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The recent economic downturn contributed to a significant contraction in our business, although we have experienced improvement over the past year. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been dramatically impacted by the recent economic downturn, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the fixed income markets endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles ("SIVs") became substantially reduced. As a result, and to protect our clients, we entered into several arrangements during fiscal 2009 and 2008 to provide support to liquidity funds, managed by a subsidiary, that had invested in SIV securities. There were no arrangements remaining as of March 31, 2010. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States rebounded during fiscal 2010, but challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform and mixed economic data. The equity markets increased due to steady improvement in consumer confidence, stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates, and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors. During fiscal 2010, the Federal Reserve Board held the discount rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. Our results were positively impacted by many of these factors and the cost saving measures that began last fiscal year. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2011. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the fiscal year as illustrated in the table below: Indices % Change for the year ended March 31, 2010 Dow Jones Industrial Average(1) 42.68 % S&P 500(2) 46.57 % NASDAQ Composite Index(3) 56.87 % Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index(4) 7.69 % Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index(4) 10.23 % (1)Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.4 billion of losses, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, related to the elimination of the exposure to SIVs in liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary in the prior fiscal year. The impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $863.4 million, net of income tax benefits, recorded in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the increase. Cash income, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to cash loss, as adjusted, of $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.7 billion of net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin increased to 12.2% from (19.9)% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to 20.6% from 23.8% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 2009 Beginning of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 38.8 43.7 Redemptions (40.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (76.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (82.0 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other(2) 134.1 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) End of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2010 were $685 billion, an increase of $52 billion or 8% from March 31, 2009. The increase in AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $134 billion, of which approximately 6% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, which was partially offset by net client outflows of $82 billion. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $64 billion, or 78% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $15 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset") and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC ("Brandywine") that had experienced past investment underperformance, although their performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010. We have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. ("Batterymarch"), The Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal") and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"). Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal 2007, although recent performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010 and the rate of outflows in this asset class has generally been lower in recent quarters. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. 35  Table of Contents Effective fiscal 2010, our alternative investment products are classified as investment funds for reporting purposes.

Although the unemployment rate remains high, the U.S. economy continues to slowly show signs of recovery. A strong rebound in corporate earnings, improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending, and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence. However, uncertainty in the markets remains, as best evidenced by the May 6, 2010 intraday sell off and subsequent rebound. With concerns regarding the credit quality of certain European nations, and as government stimulus initiatives continue globally, debates about inflation and deflation loom. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 61%, 72%, and 86%, respectively, of our marketed equity composite(2) assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88%, respectively, of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. In the fixed income markets, government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk. Most sector spreads declined in the past year as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities. Investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with 2000 basis points in excess returns over treasuries in 2009. (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 85% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 82% and 84%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. 37 Table of Contents For the 1 year period, the Treasury yield curve remains historically steep as the Federal Reserve continues to keep federal funds at close to 0%. The worst performing fixed income sector was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond returning (3.70)%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds which returned 58.21% for 2009. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 88%, 40%, 50%, and 88%, respectively, of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17%, respectively, of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 62%, 68%, 70%, and 80%, respectively, of our U.S. long term mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75%, respectively, of our U.S. long term mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 51%, 63%, 65%, and 78%, respectively, of our U.S. equity mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76%, respectively, of our U.S. equity mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average.

Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,866.9 70.9 $ 2,290.5 68.2 (18.5 ) International 768.0 29.1 1,066.9 31.8 (28.0 ) Total $ 2,634.9 100.0 $ 3,357.4 100.0 (21.5 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset, LMCM, and ClearBridge, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at Permal. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 were $2.6 billion, down 22% from $3.4 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 17% decrease in average AUM. The shift in the mix of average AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $202.4 million, or 20%, to $814.8 million. Of this decrease, $104.3 million was the result of lower average equity assets at ClearBridge, Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), LMCM and Brandywine, and $95.5 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 38 Table of Contents Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $469.1 million, or 26%, to $1.4 billion. Of this decrease, $309.2 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at Permal, LMCM, and ClearBridge, $73.1 million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors, and $66.9 million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset. Performance fees increased 310%, or $54.0 million, to $71.5 million during fiscal 2010, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset and Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 21% to $375.3 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund AUM and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses As a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal 2009 due to challenging market conditions, actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of promotional costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, with many of the more significant actions implemented in the December 2008 quarter. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2010 and 2009, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 2% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was driven by a $139.1 million decrease in revenue share based compensation, primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal 2010, the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates. The net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately $27.5 million. These reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $150.3 million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by gains in other non operating income (expense). Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.2% from 33.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 29% to $691.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 13% to $163.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a $13.6 million reduction in technology consulting fees, telecommunications and market data services. Reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense, which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2010, of $7.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, also contributed to the decrease. Occupancy expense decreased 25% to $157.0 million, primarily due to the recognition of $70.1 million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year, offset in part by a $19.3 million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 38% to $22.8 million, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2009, which reduced amortization expense by $13.5 million. Impairment charges were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and projected cash flows within that division. The remaining $146 million related to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and the impairment of a trade name. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $14.4 million to $167.6 million, primarily as a result of cost savings 39 Table of Contents initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of $15.6 million, and advertising costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.5 million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors. In May 2010, we announced a plan to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes: 1) transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates where they are closer to the actual client relationships and can be delivered with greater effectiveness; and 2) our Americas distribution group sharing in revenue on retail based AUM growth. This plan involves headcount reductions in operations, technology and other administrative areas at the corporate location, which may be partially offset by headcount increases at the affiliates, and will ultimately enable us to eliminate a portion of our corporate office space that was dedicated to our operations and technology employees. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 to $150 million, and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The initiative is projected to involve restructuring and transition related costs that will primarily include transition payments to affiliates (primarily compensation) to temporarily offset the cost of absorbing the services, charges for severance and retention incentives, and may also include costs for early contract terminations and asset disposals. The total expected costs are in the range of $190 to $210 million and will be incurred over the next two fiscal years. However, the achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements, as well as the amount of restructuring and transition related costs, will be subject to many factors, including market conditions and other factors affecting the financial results of the Company and our affiliates and the rate of AUM growth. In addition, our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 87% to $7.4 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances, which reduced interest income by $36.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Interest expense decreased 31% to $126.3 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009, which reduced interest expense by $36.5 million, and a $24.6 million decrease due to the repayment of $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in March 2009, the repayment of our 6.75% senior notes in July 2008, the repayment of the $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million term loan in January 2010, as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal 2010. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily related to the early repayment of our $700 million term loan. Due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds, in fiscal 2010 we reversed unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 of $20.6 million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve SIVs. During fiscal 2009, fund support losses were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fund support. Other non operating income (expense) increased $213.5 million to income of $104.3 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.7 million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above, and $91.1 million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products, which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our Equity Units in fiscal 2010. Income Tax Benefit The provision for income taxes was $118.7 million compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 36.0% compared to a benefit rate of 38.4% in the prior year. The current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The prior years benefit rate was driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge, offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary. 40 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "cash income," "cash income, as adjusted," and "operating margin, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Cash Income (Loss), as Adjusted We define "cash income" as net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment. We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus (less) net money market fund support losses (gains) and impairment charges less net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities. We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items as indicators of value that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, issued contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments. We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. Legg Mason considers cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value that facilitate comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, significant acquisitions, or issued contingent convertible debt. In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangibles and goodwill over time, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income. Conversely, we subtract the realized income tax benefits on impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add (subtract) net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities, if applicable) and impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Masons operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures. Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted, because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 41 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to cash income (loss), as adjusted (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,769 36,488 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 136,252 142,494 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 34,445 32,340 Cash Income (Loss) 397,823 (2,201,214 ) Plus (Less): Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (16,565 ) 1,376,579 Impairment charges 1,307,970 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Cash Income (Loss), as adjusted $ 381,258 $ (1,191,389 ) Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.32 $ (13.99 ) Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.26 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.88 1.01 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.22 0.23 Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share 2.56 (15.65 ) Plus (Less): Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (0.11 ) 9.79 Impairment charges 9.30 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, as adjusted $ 2.45 $ (8.47 ) (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit). The increase in cash income (loss), as adjusted, was primarily due to the impact of net realized losses of $1.7 billion on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted We calculate "operating margin, as adjusted," by dividing (i) operating income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements and, impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues less distribution and servicing expenses that are passed through to third party distributors, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues." The compensation items are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on net income. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products. Legg Mason believes that operating margin, as adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what Legg Masons operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our 42 Table of Contents products. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,634,879 $ 3,357,367 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 691,931 969,964 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 1,942,948 $ 2,387,403 Operating Income (Loss) $ 321,183 $ (669,180 ) Add (Less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 79,316 (70,950 ) Impairment charges 1,307,970 Operating Income, as adjusted $ 400,499 $ 567,840 Operating margin, GAAP basis 12.2 % (19.9 )% Operating margin, as adjusted 20.6 23.8 Because operating margin, as adjusted, is a more relevant indicator of operating performance that management utilizes, we no longer present pre tax profit margin, as adjusted. 43  Table of Contents FISCAL 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2008 Financial Overview Net loss attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion, or $13.99 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $263.6 million, or $1.83 per diluted share in the prior year. During fiscal 2009, we eliminated the exposure to SIVs of all liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary by purchasing and subsequently selling, or reimbursing the funds for a portion of the losses they incurred in selling, all securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds and held by us. The majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit or a total return swap ("TRS") prior to the purchase. These transactions, along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than SIVs, resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $2.3 billion. Also, during fiscal 2009, impairment charges of $1.3 billion were recorded, related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division, as a result of declines in the AUM and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division, and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name. Cash loss, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, compared to cash income, as adjusted, of $879.5 million, or $6.11 per diluted share, in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009. The operating margin declined to (19.9%) from 22.7% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in fiscal 2009. The operating margin, as adjusted, declined to 23.8% from 35.5% in fiscal 2008. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 2008 Beginning of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 43.7 54.2 Redemptions (78.6 ) (66.1 ) Separate account flows, net (109.0 ) (20.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) 5.7 Net client cash flows (158.9 ) (26.3 ) Market performance and other(2) (157.7 ) 9.9 Dispositions (1.1 ) (2.0 ) End of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2009 were $632.4 billion, a decrease of $317.7 billion or 33% from March 31, 2008. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $159 billion and market depreciation of $158 billion, of which approximately 10% was related to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation. There were net client outflows in all asset classes. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $89 billion, or 56% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $47 billion and $23 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset that experienced investment performance issues, particularly in fiscal 2009. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by key equity products managed at ClearBridge, LMCM and Permal. Effective fiscal 2010, our alternative investment products are classified as investment funds for reporting purposes. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Equity $ 126.9 20.1 $ 271.6 28.6 (53.3 ) Fixed Income 357.6 56.5 508.2 53.5 (29.6 ) Liquidity 147.9 23.4 170.3 17.9 (13.2 ) Total $ 632.4 100.0 $ 950.1 100.0 (33.4 ) 44 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2008 $ 271.6 $ 508.2 $ 170.3 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 26.5 17.2 43.7 Redemptions (46.4 ) (32.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (26.7 ) (74.1 ) (8.2 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (46.6 ) (89.1 ) (23.2 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other (97.0 ) (61.5 ) 0.8 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) (1.1 ) March 31, 2009 $ 126.9 $ 357.6 $ 147.9 $ 632.4 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Equity $ 203.2 25.1 $ 327.6 33.1 (38.0 ) Fixed Income 438.0 54.0 498.6 50.3 (12.2 ) Liquidity 169.2 20.9 163.9 16.6 3.2 Total $ 810.4 100.0 $ 990.1 100.0 (18.1 ) AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 446.7 70.6 $ 672.2 70.8 (33.5 ) International 185.7 29.4 277.9 29.2 (33.2 ) Total $ 632.4 100.0 $ 950.1 100.0 (33.4 ) The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2008 $ 672.2 $ 277.9 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 28.4 15.3 43.7 Redemptions (47.3 ) (31.3 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (84.5 ) (24.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (6.7 ) (8.3 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (110.1 ) (48.8 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other (114.3 ) (43.4 ) (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) (1.1 ) March 31, 2009 $ 446.7 $ 185.7 $ 632.4 45 Table of Contents Investment Performance(4) Fiscal 2009 was characterized by significant volatility with erratic, unprecedented price movements across a variety of markets. The markets were significantly impacted by the failure of major financial institutions, the freeze in the credit markets and unprecedented government intervention. In addition, the downturn in housing that led the U.S. into a broader slowdown set off financial turmoil. As a result, financial stocks led the equity markets lower, with the S&P 500 Financials Index down 63%, compared to the broader S&P 500 Index, which dropped 38%. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88% of our marketed equity composite(5) assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 53%, 53%, 49%, and 94% of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. In the fixed income markets, the economic crisis deepened, but the governments numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery, causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the March 2009 quarter. The fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy, and the governments intention to issue more public debt for financing, caused yields to rise during the quarter. For the 1 year period, Treasury yields decreased significantly while long term rates increased resulting in a steeper yield curve. In addition, the worst performing sectors were home equity asset backed securities and investment grade corporate securities as measured by the Barclays ABS Home Equity Index returning (35)% and the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index returning (7)% for the 1 year period. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 4%, 21%, 54%, and 74% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 41%, 45%, 57%, and 85% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 45%, 50%, 50%, and 91% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 38%, 41%, 45%, and 72% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 33%, 34%, 67%, and 68% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. (4)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (5)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2009, 85% of our equity assets under management and 84% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. As of March 31, 2008, 86% of our equity assets under management and 83% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. (6)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 46 Table of Contents Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 2,290.5 68.2 $ 3,217.2 69.4 (28.8 ) International 1,066.9 31.8 1,416.9 30.6 (24.7 ) Total $ 3,357.4 100.0 $ 4,634.1 100.0 (27.6 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by LMCM, ClearBridge, and Royce, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by PCM, ClearBridge and LMCM, and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to a decline in fund revenues and performance fees at Permal, lower separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from International balanced and fixed income funds. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009 were $3.4 billion, down 28% from $4.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an 18% decrease in average AUM, due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately 38% and fixed income assets of approximately 12%. The shift in the mix of AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately $115.3 million, or 87%. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $447.3 million, or 31%, to $1.0 billion. Of this decrease, $273.1 million was the result of lower average equity assets at PCM, ClearBridge, LMCM and Brandywine, $80.9 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, and $43.9 million was the result of the sale of the Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") business. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the sale. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $483.4 million, or 21%, to $1.8 billion. Of this decrease, approximately $450 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at LMCM, ClearBridge, Permal, and Royce, approximately $76 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, offset by approximately $42 million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed, primarily at Western Asset. Performance fees decreased 87%, or $115.3 million, to $17.4 million during fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 31% to $475.0 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds, which resulted in a decrease of $176.7 million. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a $341 million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal 2009; the impact of cost savings initiatives, such as reductions in headcount, discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately $86 million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately $59 million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans, which are largely offset by losses in other non operating income (expense). These decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of $40 million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held SIV issued securities. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to 33.7% from 33.9% in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of 47 Table of Contents administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 24% to $970.0 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 2% to $188.3 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an $11.3 million decrease in technology consulting fees, offset in part by a $4.1 million increase in market data costs for services previously included in Other expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure. Occupancy expense increased 62% to $209.5 million, primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling $70.1 million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of $9.0 million. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 36% to $36.5 million, primarily as a result of the sale of the LMPPG business, which reduced amortization expense by $10.6 million, and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year 2008, which reduced amortization expense by $6.6 million. Impairment charges increased to $1.3 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division. The remaining $146 million relates to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and a related trade name. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $27.8 million to $182.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of $11.4 million, lower professional fees of $7.2 million and lower advertising costs of $5.4 million. In addition, the sale of the LMPPG overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately $5 million. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 27% to $56.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances, which decreased interest income by $42.1 million, offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt, which increased interest income by $25.3 million. Interest expense increased 105% to $182.8 million as a result of higher debt levels. We raised $1.15 billion in May 2008 by issuing Equity Units, and $1.25 billion in January 2008 by issuing 2.5% convertible senior notes which resulted in an increase of approximately $108.9 million in interest expense, of which $25.8 million relates to the impact of a full year of imputed interest on our 2.5% convertible senior notes. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of $425 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes in July 2008 and lower interest rates paid on our term loan, which together resulted in a decrease of $28.6 million. Fund support losses increased $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of continued SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $116.0 million to a loss of $109.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $58.3 million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above, and $33.1 million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit was $1.2 billion compared to income tax expense of $173.5 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 38.4% in the current year compared to a 39.7% provision in the prior year. The current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits. In addition, the current year includes approximately $80 million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary, offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge. 48 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income, As Adjusted A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to cash income (loss), as adjusted (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ (1,967,918 ) $ 263,565 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 36,488 57,271 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 142,494 143,600 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) (56,187 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 32,340 6,544 Cash Income (Loss) (2,201,214 ) 414,793 Plus (Less): Net money market fund support losses(1) 1,376,579 313,726 Impairment charges 1,307,970 151,000 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Cash Income (Loss), as adjusted $ (1,191,389 ) $ 879,519 Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ (13.99 ) $ 1.83 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.26 0.40 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 1.01 0.99 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) (0.39 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.23 0.05 Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share (15.65 ) 2.88 Plus (Less): Net money market fund support losses(1) 9.79 2.18 Impairment charges 9.30 1.05 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, as adjusted $ (8.47 ) $ 6.11 (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit).

Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of operations. At March 31, 2010, our cash, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.5 billion, $8.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,427.7 $ 409.8 $ 1,144.9 Cash flows used for investing activities (276.7 ) (1,090.9 ) (2,103.3 ) Cash flows (used for) from financing activities (746.7 ) 329.2 1,220.0 Effect of exchange rate changes 19.5 (27.2 ) 18.4 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 423.8 (379.1 ) 280.0 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,084.5 1,463.6 1,183.6 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,508.3 $ 1,084.5 $ 1,463.6 Cash flows from operating activities were $1,427.7 million during fiscal 2010 compared to cash flows of $409.8 million for the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to approximately $1.04 billion of income tax refunds received during fiscal 2010. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the 50 Table of Contents amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support agreements. Cash outflows for financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million 5 year term loan and $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the Equity Units exchange offer, as described below, and the payment of cash dividends. We expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. We received approximately $580 million in tax refunds during the June 2009 quarter, primarily attributable to tax benefits from the utilization of $1.6 billion of realized losses incurred in fiscal 2009 on the sale of securities issued by SIVs. Federal legislation, enacted in November 2009 to extend the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years, enabled us to utilize an additional $1.3 billion of net operating loss deductions, and as a result, we received an additional $459 million in tax refunds in January 2010. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $359 million and future deductions for purchased goodwill and intangible assets aggregating approximately $3.5 billion will reduce future taxable income and related U.S. federal tax payments. We may elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities, including share repurchases, seed capital investments in new products, repayment of outstanding debt, or acquisitions. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million. It had been anticipated that these earnings would be used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. We intend to repatriate these remaining earnings in order to create lower taxed foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized. No further repatriation beyond the $225 million of foreign earnings is contemplated. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. We also currently have approximately $1 billion in free cash in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase common stock. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If this were to occur, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. In connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model, we expect to incur restructuring and transition related costs in the range of $190 to $210 million over the next two fiscal years. A portion of the restructuring and transition related costs, approximately 15%, will be paid in shares of restricted stock or the acceleration of other equity awards. We expect that, approximately 60% of these costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2011 and the remainder in fiscal 2012. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 to $150 million, and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, excluding costs incurred to achieve these savings. 51 Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2010: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Face Amount at March 31, 2010 Type 2010 2009 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,051,243 $ 1,016,798 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 103,039 1,150,000 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 LIBOR + 2.50% Repaid January 2010 In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% senior notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion have been used for general corporate purposes, primarily the purchase of SIV securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. The transaction increased the interest coverage ratio under our bank credit facilities as a result of lower interest expense. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2010 and 2009 of approximately $34.4 million and $32.3 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. The facility was scheduled to mature on October 14, 2010; however, in fiscal 2010, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to February 11, 2013. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. During January 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from $1 billion to $500 million and further modified covenants. In February 2010, we amended the credit agreement to extend the expiration of the 52 Table of Contents commitments and the maturity date of the loans, as discussed above, and further modified covenants, as discussed below. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately 0.36 million and 5.53 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately 0.36 and 5.53 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the acquisition of Citigroups asset management business in fiscal 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash, using capital raised through the sale of the 2.5% convertible senior notes discussed above. In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap ("Swap") to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The swap fully matured in December 2008. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. In order to complete the May 2008 issuance of the Equity Units, we received a waiver of the covenant that prevents us from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. We may not, subject to a few limited exceptions, incur more than $250 million in new indebtedness until we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness or we experience an increase in our trailing twelve month EBITDA. At March 31, 2010, our financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. The maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was decreased from 3.0 to 2.5 in a February 2010 amendment. In February 2010, the maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was also revised to reduce the minimum amount of unrestricted cash that is not deducted from outstanding debt in calculating the ratio under the covenant from $500 million to $375 million. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of $375 million, as discussed above. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, any non cash charges and up to $3.0 billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support. As of March 31, 2010, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 7.4. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2010. If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, use available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by three rating agencies: Moodys Investor Services ("Moodys"), Standard and Poors Rating Services ("Standard and Poors"), and Fitch Ratings. Our current Moodys rating is Baa1 with a stable outlook. Our current Standard and Poors rating is BBB+ with a negative outlook and our current Fitch rating is BBB+ with a stable outlook. In the event of downgrades by Moodys and or Standard and Poors, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the 53 Table of Contents acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We had the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right was not exercised, the holders of those equity interests had the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, representing earnout payments based upon Permals revenues through the second anniversary date and the purchase of 37.5% of the preference shares, of which $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in our common stock. During fiscal 2010, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, we paid an aggregate amount of $27.0 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. In July 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4.0 million shares of common stock from the proceeds of the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares discussed above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2010 and 2009. On May 10, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had replaced the July 2007 share repurchase authorization with a new authorization to purchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. On May 24, 2010, we announced that we entered into agreements to repurchase $300 million of our outstanding common stock in accelerated share repurchase transactions, which were funded with our available cash. We currently intend to use a portion of our available cash to purchase an additional approximately $100 million of our common stock by the end of fiscal 2011. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2010, we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In May 2010, all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares were exchanged for shares of our common stock. On April 27, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share, representing an increase of $0.01 per share over the prior four quarters. The dividend in fiscal 2010 was reduced significantly from fiscal 2009 in order to improve our flexibility to respond to cash needs and potential business opportunities requiring cash outflows. 54 Table of Contents Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2010 all support arrangements were terminated or expired. As of March 31, 2009, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: 2009 Earliest Transaction Date Description Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Capital Support Agreements(2) September 2008 $ 34,500 $ 34,500 Capital Support Agreements(3) October 2008 7,000 7,000 Total $ 41,500 $ 41,500 (1)Included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2)Pertains to Western Asset Institutional Money Market Fund, Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Euro Fund) and Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Sterling Fund). (3)Pertains to Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (USD Fund). During fiscal 2008, we entered into arrangements with two third party banks to provide letters of credit ("LOCs") for an aggregate amount of approximately $485 million for the benefit of three liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support four of these agreements, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. Additionally, one of the arrangements was supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2009, these LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $286 million in collateral was returned. During fiscal 2008, we entered into six capital support agreements ("CSAs"). Under the terms of the CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $415 million in support to two liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $415 million in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. During fiscal 2009, $200 million in principal amount of securities supported by one of these CSAs matured and were paid in full. The related CSA terminated in accordance with its terms and collateral of $15 million was returned. The remaining CSAs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the remaining $400 million in collateral was returned. Also during fiscal year 2008, we entered into a TRS arrangement with a major bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which the Bank purchased securities issued by three SIVs from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund managed by one of our subsidiaries. The $890 million in face amount of commercial paper was purchased by the Bank for cash at an aggregate amount of $832 million, which represents an estimate of value determined for collateral purposes. In addition, we reimbursed the fund for the $59.5 million difference between the funds carrying value, including accrued interest, and the amount paid and provided $139.5 million in cash collateral, which under the terms of the agreements could be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. 55 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to two liquidity funds in the form of two standby letters of credit in the total amount of approximately $257 million. We provided collateral equal to the total support amount under the LOCs. These LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the $257 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we entered into and amended various capital support agreements. Under the terms of the new and amended CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $1.07 billion in support to particular liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $1.07 billion in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. CSAs aggregating $1.03 billion terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $1.03 billion of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, $440 million in principal amount of securities previously supported under the TRS arrangement matured and were paid in full and an additional $95 million in principal amount of securities under the TRS arrangement was repaid. Also during fiscal 2009, non bank sponsored SIV securities purchased from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund in fiscal 2008 matured and $82 million in principal amount and interest was paid in full. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from six liquidity funds that were previously supported under twelve CSAs and seven LOCs. Upon the purchase of these securities, the twelve CSAs aggregating $1.4 billion and seven LOCs aggregating $742 million were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which includes the return of $1.03 billion and $257 million of collateral provided during the current fiscal year to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs, respectively. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by the TRS and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder and $42 million of collateral was returned. Credit and Liquidity Risk Cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 16 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, all of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2010, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS, which are fully described 56 Table of Contents above and in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Contingent Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 5.2 2.3 0.9 0.9 1,250.9 108.9 1,369.1 Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2) 46.4 39.0 38.9 38.9 38.8 45.4 247.4 Minimum rental and service commitments 139.2 121.8 107.2 88.6 80.4 593.1 1,130.3 Minimum commitments under capital leases(3) 31.8 1.9 33.7 Total Contractual Obligations 472.6 165.0 147.0 128.4 1,370.1 747.4 3,030.5 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(4) 2.2 2.2 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(5,6) $ 472.6 $ 165.0 $ 149.2 $ 128.4 $ 1,370.1 $ 747.4 $ 3,032.7 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013.

(2)Interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2010. (3)The amount of commitments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the agreements. Fiscal 2011 includes $29.0 million related to a put/purchase option agreement with the owner of land and a building. We currently do not intend to purchase this land and building, which could result in the forfeiture of our $4 million escrow deposit. (4)The amount of contingent payments represents the fair value of the expected payment determined on the closing date of the acquisition, March 31, 2010. The maximum contingent payment that could be due in this fiscal year is $7.0 million. (5)The table above does not include approximately $45.7 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a general or limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal 2018. (6)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $42.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. 57  Table of Contents MARKET RISK The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non Trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products, and previously also included securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments prior to March 31, 2009. Trading investments at March 31, 2010 and 2009 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2010 2009 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 167,127 $ 128,785 Proprietary fund products and other investments 204,933 207,307 Total trading investments $ 372,060 $ 336,092 Approximately $149.8 million and $119.0 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading investments of $17.3 million and $9.8 million at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. Approximately $204.9 million and $207.3 million of trading assets at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $33.0 million and $46.3 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $17.7 million and $16.6 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are allocated to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment funds, and therefore do not impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $19.3 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. We 58 Table of Contents did not hedge risk on proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2009. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. Beginning in November 2007, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds. These arrangements included LOCs, CSAs, a TRS arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or the funds sold, all remaining securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure. Prior to the purchase, the majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit and a TRS. The various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and no losses were realized. Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2010 and 2009 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2010 2009 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 6,957 $ 6,818 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 136,469 59,515 Other investments 1,884 1,423 Total non trading assets $ 145,310 $ 67,756 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ $ 20,631 Investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2010 includes approximately $55.7 million of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program ("PPIP"). As previously discussed, by March 31, 2009, we effectively eliminated our exposure to SIVs. As of March 31, 2009, we recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $20.6 million, for which our exposure was limited to approximately $41.5 million. After the termination of these remaining fund support arrangements during fiscal 2010, we no longer have any exposure or additional potential losses related to supported securities. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." The elimination of SIV exposure from our Balance Sheet and money market funds as of March 31, 2009 substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk. See Notes 1, 17 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. 59 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2010: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase(1) Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease(1) Trading investments: Investment related to deferred compensation plans $ 167,127 $ 200,552 $ 133,702 Proprietary fund products and other 204,933 245,920 163,946 Total trading investment 372,060 446,472 297,648 Available for sale investments 6,957 8,348 5,566 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 136,469 163,763 109,175 Other investments 1,884 2,261 1,507 Total investments subject to market risk $ 517,370 $ 620,844 $ 413,896 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability, or noncontrolling interests. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $19.3 million have been hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $39.2 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings, respectively, as of March 31, 2010. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $253.6 million and $806 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2010, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other 60 Table of Contents securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2010, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $173.8 billion, $364.3 billion, and $146.4 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. The recent economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2010, less than 2% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. 61 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments were based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which supported investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of $20.6 million was included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No derivative asset was recorded as of March 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of $20.6 million were recovered. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, we owned approximately $48.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, we also have approximately $136.5 million and $59.5 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method, with the exception of $55.7 million of investments, as of March 31, 2010, related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys PPIP, which are recorded at fair value. The accounting guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which: prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. Previously, this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by SIVs. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions. 62  Table of Contents The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products are valued at NAV determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAV of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. As of March 31, 2010, approximately 2% of total assets (36% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2010 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 70,073 $ 9,050 $ 79,123 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,601,551 1,151,748 3,753,299 Trade names 7,700 62,100 69,800 Goodwill 910,959 404,337 1,315,296 $ 3,590,283 $ 1,627,235 $ 5,217,518 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. 63 Table of Contents Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2009, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of December 31, 2009. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2010, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2010, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 8 years with a weighted average life of approximately 4.3 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names. We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. 64 Table of Contents The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2009 annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 8%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 8% thereafter. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 14%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 9% thereafter. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 14.7% and 15.1%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 5% and 34%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15.2% and 18.8%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $144 million and $484 million, respectively. Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Americas and International divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. For our December 31, 2009 annual impairment test, the projected cash flows were discounted at 14.7% and 15.1%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 12%, with a longterm annual growth rate of approximately 9%. 65 Table of Contents Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 15%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Cash flow growth for the Americas and International divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections were based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods, in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and market influences relevant to their business. Long term growth of 9% for both divisions was based on our historical experience, available historic market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately 50% from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 6 and 7 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. As of December 31, 2009, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 1.5 million, 1.5 million, and 0.9 million stock options in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation 66 Table of Contents of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2010, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $611 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.0 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $116 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2010, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $212 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $49.2 million for fiscal year 2010. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. As of March 31, 2010, U.K. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, are not material. An additional valuation allowance was recorded on $2.9 million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Consolidation Special purpose entities ("SPEs") are trusts, partnerships, corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose. SPEs generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement, derive continued benefit, exhibit control or have recourse. We do not utilize SPEs as a form of financing or to provide liquidity, nor have we recognized any gains or losses from the sale of assets to SPEs. In accordance with accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"), SPEs are designated as either a voting interest entity or a VIE, with VIEs subject to consolidation by the party deemed to be the primary beneficiary, if any. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, either contractual or implied, or in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also considered VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the entity that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or if there is no such entity, the entity that will receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. In accordance with the accounting guidance, our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker. Under current guidance, it is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients unless our ownership interest, including interests of related parties, in a VIE is substantial, unless we may earn significant performance fees from the VIE or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest. The accounting guidance also requires the disclosure of VIEs in which we are a sponsor or are considered to have a significant variable interest. In determining whether a variable interest is significant, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary. In 67 Table of Contents determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned by and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows and credit and interest rate risks. These assumptions and estimates have a significant bearing on the determination of the primary beneficiary. If we, together with our related party relationships, are determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is consolidated within our financial statements. If our assumptions or estimates were to be materially incorrect, we might be required to consolidate additional VIEs. Consolidation of these VIEs would result in an increase in Assets with a corresponding increase in Noncontrolling interests or Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and a decrease in Investment advisory fees and an increase or decrease in Other non operating income (expense) with a corresponding offset in Noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but would have no impact on Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. As further discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are amendments and proposed amendments to consolidation accounting that may require us to consolidate additional VIEs or voting interest entities. As of March 31, 2010, we are the primary beneficiary of one sponsored investment fund VIE, which resulted in consolidation. This VIE had total assets and total equity of $52.7 million as of March 31, 2010, and $48.2 million as of March 31, 2009. Our investment in this VIE was $27.5 million and $26.3 million as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which represents our maximum risk of loss. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of variable interests. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; 68 Table of Contents the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (6)Calculated based on total debt as a percentage of total capital (total stockholders equity plus total debt) as of March 31. 31  Table of Contents  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management. We manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. Our division management reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer. The Americas division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. We believe this structure provides greater focus and allows us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset 32 Table of Contents management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The recent economic downturn contributed to a significant contraction in our business, although we have experienced improvement over the past year. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been dramatically impacted by the recent economic downturn, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the fixed income markets endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles ("SIVs") became substantially reduced. As a result, and to protect our clients, we entered into several arrangements during fiscal 2009 and 2008 to provide support to liquidity funds, managed by a subsidiary, that had invested in SIV securities. There were no arrangements remaining as of March 31, 2010. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States rebounded during fiscal 2010, but challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform and mixed economic data. The equity markets increased due to steady improvement in consumer confidence, stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates, and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors. During fiscal 2010, the Federal Reserve Board held the discount rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. Our results were positively impacted by many of these factors and the cost saving measures that began last fiscal year. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2011. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the fiscal year as illustrated in the table below: Indices % Change for the year ended March 31, 2010 Dow Jones Industrial Average(1) 42.68 % S&P 500(2) 46.57 % NASDAQ Composite Index(3) 56.87 % Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index(4) 7.69 % Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index(4) 10.23 % (1)Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.4 billion of losses, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, related to the elimination of the exposure to SIVs in liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary in the prior fiscal year. The impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $863.4 million, net of income tax benefits, recorded in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the increase. Cash income, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to cash loss, as adjusted, of $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.7 billion of net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin increased to 12.2% from (19.9)% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to 20.6% from 23.8% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 2009 Beginning of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 38.8 43.7 Redemptions (40.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (76.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (82.0 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other(2) 134.1 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) End of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2010 were $685 billion, an increase of $52 billion or 8% from March 31, 2009. The increase in AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $134 billion, of which approximately 6% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, which was partially offset by net client outflows of $82 billion. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $64 billion, or 78% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $15 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset") and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC ("Brandywine") that had experienced past investment underperformance, although their performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010. We have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. ("Batterymarch"), The Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal") and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"). Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal 2007, although recent performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010 and the rate of outflows in this asset class has generally been lower in recent quarters. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. 35  Table of Contents Effective fiscal 2010, our alternative investment products are classified as investment funds for reporting purposes.

Although the unemployment rate remains high, the U.S. economy continues to slowly show signs of recovery. A strong rebound in corporate earnings, improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending, and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence. However, uncertainty in the markets remains, as best evidenced by the May 6, 2010 intraday sell off and subsequent rebound. With concerns regarding the credit quality of certain European nations, and as government stimulus initiatives continue globally, debates about inflation and deflation loom. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 61%, 72%, and 86%, respectively, of our marketed equity composite(2) assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88%, respectively, of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. In the fixed income markets, government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk. Most sector spreads declined in the past year as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities. Investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with 2000 basis points in excess returns over treasuries in 2009. (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 85% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 82% and 84%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. 37 Table of Contents For the 1 year period, the Treasury yield curve remains historically steep as the Federal Reserve continues to keep federal funds at close to 0%. The worst performing fixed income sector was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond returning (3.70)%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds which returned 58.21% for 2009. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 88%, 40%, 50%, and 88%, respectively, of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17%, respectively, of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 62%, 68%, 70%, and 80%, respectively, of our U.S. long term mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75%, respectively, of our U.S. long term mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 51%, 63%, 65%, and 78%, respectively, of our U.S. equity mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76%, respectively, of our U.S. equity mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average.

Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,866.9 70.9 $ 2,290.5 68.2 (18.5 ) International 768.0 29.1 1,066.9 31.8 (28.0 ) Total $ 2,634.9 100.0 $ 3,357.4 100.0 (21.5 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset, LMCM, and ClearBridge, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at Permal. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 were $2.6 billion, down 22% from $3.4 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 17% decrease in average AUM. The shift in the mix of average AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $202.4 million, or 20%, to $814.8 million. Of this decrease, $104.3 million was the result of lower average equity assets at ClearBridge, Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), LMCM and Brandywine, and $95.5 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 38 Table of Contents Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $469.1 million, or 26%, to $1.4 billion. Of this decrease, $309.2 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at Permal, LMCM, and ClearBridge, $73.1 million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors, and $66.9 million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset. Performance fees increased 310%, or $54.0 million, to $71.5 million during fiscal 2010, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset and Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 21% to $375.3 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund AUM and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses As a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal 2009 due to challenging market conditions, actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of promotional costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, with many of the more significant actions implemented in the December 2008 quarter. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2010 and 2009, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 2% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was driven by a $139.1 million decrease in revenue share based compensation, primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal 2010, the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates. The net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately $27.5 million. These reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $150.3 million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by gains in other non operating income (expense). Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.2% from 33.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 29% to $691.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 13% to $163.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a $13.6 million reduction in technology consulting fees, telecommunications and market data services. Reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense, which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2010, of $7.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, also contributed to the decrease. Occupancy expense decreased 25% to $157.0 million, primarily due to the recognition of $70.1 million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year, offset in part by a $19.3 million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 38% to $22.8 million, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2009, which reduced amortization expense by $13.5 million. Impairment charges were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and projected cash flows within that division. The remaining $146 million related to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and the impairment of a trade name. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $14.4 million to $167.6 million, primarily as a result of cost savings 39 Table of Contents initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of $15.6 million, and advertising costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.5 million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors. In May 2010, we announced a plan to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes: 1) transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates where they are closer to the actual client relationships and can be delivered with greater effectiveness; and 2) our Americas distribution group sharing in revenue on retail based AUM growth. This plan involves headcount reductions in operations, technology and other administrative areas at the corporate location, which may be partially offset by headcount increases at the affiliates, and will ultimately enable us to eliminate a portion of our corporate office space that was dedicated to our operations and technology employees. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 to $150 million, and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The initiative is projected to involve restructuring and transition related costs that will primarily include transition payments to affiliates (primarily compensation) to temporarily offset the cost of absorbing the services, charges for severance and retention incentives, and may also include costs for early contract terminations and asset disposals. The total expected costs are in the range of $190 to $210 million and will be incurred over the next two fiscal years. However, the achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements, as well as the amount of restructuring and transition related costs, will be subject to many factors, including market conditions and other factors affecting the financial results of the Company and our affiliates and the rate of AUM growth. In addition, our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 87% to $7.4 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances, which reduced interest income by $36.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Interest expense decreased 31% to $126.3 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009, which reduced interest expense by $36.5 million, and a $24.6 million decrease due to the repayment of $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in March 2009, the repayment of our 6.75% senior notes in July 2008, the repayment of the $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million term loan in January 2010, as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal 2010. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily related to the early repayment of our $700 million term loan. Due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds, in fiscal 2010 we reversed unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 of $20.6 million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve SIVs. During fiscal 2009, fund support losses were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fund support. Other non operating income (expense) increased $213.5 million to income of $104.3 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.7 million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above, and $91.1 million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products, which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our Equity Units in fiscal 2010. Income Tax Benefit The provision for income taxes was $118.7 million compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 36.0% compared to a benefit rate of 38.4% in the prior year. The current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The prior years benefit rate was driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge, offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary. 40 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "cash income," "cash income, as adjusted," and "operating margin, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Cash Income (Loss), as Adjusted We define "cash income" as net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment. We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus (less) net money market fund support losses (gains) and impairment charges less net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities. We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items as indicators of value that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, issued contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments. We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. Legg Mason considers cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value that facilitate comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, significant acquisitions, or issued contingent convertible debt. In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangibles and goodwill over time, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income. Conversely, we subtract the realized income tax benefits on impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add (subtract) net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities, if applicable) and impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Masons operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures. Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted, because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 41 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to cash income (loss), as adjusted (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,769 36,488 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 136,252 142,494 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 34,445 32,340 Cash Income (Loss) 397,823 (2,201,214 ) Plus (Less): Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (16,565 ) 1,376,579 Impairment charges 1,307,970 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Cash Income (Loss), as adjusted $ 381,258 $ (1,191,389 ) Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.32 $ (13.99 ) Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.26 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.88 1.01 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.22 0.23 Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share 2.56 (15.65 ) Plus (Less): Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (0.11 ) 9.79 Impairment charges 9.30 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, as adjusted $ 2.45 $ (8.47 ) (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit). The increase in cash income (loss), as adjusted, was primarily due to the impact of net realized losses of $1.7 billion on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted We calculate "operating margin, as adjusted," by dividing (i) operating income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements and, impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues less distribution and servicing expenses that are passed through to third party distributors, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues." The compensation items are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on net income. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products. Legg Mason believes that operating margin, as adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what Legg Masons operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our 42 Table of Contents products. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,634,879 $ 3,357,367 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 691,931 969,964 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 1,942,948 $ 2,387,403 Operating Income (Loss) $ 321,183 $ (669,180 ) Add (Less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 79,316 (70,950 ) Impairment charges 1,307,970 Operating Income, as adjusted $ 400,499 $ 567,840 Operating margin, GAAP basis 12.2 % (19.9 )% Operating margin, as adjusted 20.6 23.8 Because operating margin, as adjusted, is a more relevant indicator of operating performance that management utilizes, we no longer present pre tax profit margin, as adjusted. 43  Table of Contents FISCAL 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2008 Financial Overview Net loss attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion, or $13.99 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $263.6 million, or $1.83 per diluted share in the prior year. During fiscal 2009, we eliminated the exposure to SIVs of all liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary by purchasing and subsequently selling, or reimbursing the funds for a portion of the losses they incurred in selling, all securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds and held by us. The majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit or a total return swap ("TRS") prior to the purchase. These transactions, along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than SIVs, resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $2.3 billion. Also, during fiscal 2009, impairment charges of $1.3 billion were recorded, related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division, as a result of declines in the AUM and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division, and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name. Cash loss, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, compared to cash income, as adjusted, of $879.5 million, or $6.11 per diluted share, in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009. The operating margin declined to (19.9%) from 22.7% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in fiscal 2009. The operating margin, as adjusted, declined to 23.8% from 35.5% in fiscal 2008. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 2008 Beginning of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 43.7 54.2 Redemptions (78.6 ) (66.1 ) Separate account flows, net (109.0 ) (20.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) 5.7 Net client cash flows (158.9 ) (26.3 ) Market performance and other(2) (157.7 ) 9.9 Dispositions (1.1 ) (2.0 ) End of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2009 were $632.4 billion, a decrease of $317.7 billion or 33% from March 31, 2008. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $159 billion and market depreciation of $158 billion, of which approximately 10% was related to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation. There were net client outflows in all asset classes. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $89 billion, or 56% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $47 billion and $23 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset that experienced investment performance issues, particularly in fiscal 2009. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by key equity products managed at ClearBridge, LMCM and Permal.

The markets were significantly impacted by the failure of major financial institutions, the freeze in the credit markets and unprecedented government intervention. In addition, the downturn in housing that led the U.S. into a broader slowdown set off financial turmoil. As a result, financial stocks led the equity markets lower, with the S&P 500 Financials Index down 63%, compared to the broader S&P 500 Index, which dropped 38%. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88% of our marketed equity composite(5) assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 53%, 53%, 49%, and 94% of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. In the fixed income markets, the economic crisis deepened, but the governments numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery, causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the March 2009 quarter. The fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy, and the governments intention to issue more public debt for financing, caused yields to rise during the quarter. For the 1 year period, Treasury yields decreased significantly while long term rates increased resulting in a steeper yield curve. In addition, the worst performing sectors were home equity asset backed securities and investment grade corporate securities as measured by the Barclays ABS Home Equity Index returning (35)% and the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index returning (7)% for the 1 year period. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 4%, 21%, 54%, and 74% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 41%, 45%, 57%, and 85% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 45%, 50%, 50%, and 91% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 38%, 41%, 45%, and 72% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 33%, 34%, 67%, and 68% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. (4)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (5)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2009, 85% of our equity assets under management and 84% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. As of March 31, 2008, 86% of our equity assets under management and 83% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. (6)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 46 Table of Contents Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 2,290.5 68.2 $ 3,217.2 69.4 (28.8 ) International 1,066.9 31.8 1,416.9 30.6 (24.7 ) Total $ 3,357.4 100.0 $ 4,634.1 100.0 (27.6 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by LMCM, ClearBridge, and Royce, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by PCM, ClearBridge and LMCM, and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to a decline in fund revenues and performance fees at Permal, lower separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from International balanced and fixed income funds. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009 were $3.4 billion, down 28% from $4.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an 18% decrease in average AUM, due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately 38% and fixed income assets of approximately 12%. The shift in the mix of AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately $115.3 million, or 87%. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $447.3 million, or 31%, to $1.0 billion. Of this decrease, $273.1 million was the result of lower average equity assets at PCM, ClearBridge, LMCM and Brandywine, $80.9 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, and $43.9 million was the result of the sale of the Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") business. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the sale. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $483.4 million, or 21%, to $1.8 billion. Of this decrease, approximately $450 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at LMCM, ClearBridge, Permal, and Royce, approximately $76 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, offset by approximately $42 million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed, primarily at Western Asset. Performance fees decreased 87%, or $115.3 million, to $17.4 million during fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 31% to $475.0 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds, which resulted in a decrease of $176.7 million. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a $341 million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal 2009; the impact of cost savings initiatives, such as reductions in headcount, discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately $86 million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately $59 million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans, which are largely offset by losses in other non operating income (expense). These decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of $40 million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held SIV issued securities. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to 33.7% from 33.9% in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of 47 Table of Contents administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 24% to $970.0 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 2% to $188.3 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an $11.3 million decrease in technology consulting fees, offset in part by a $4.1 million increase in market data costs for services previously included in Other expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure. Occupancy expense increased 62% to $209.5 million, primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling $70.1 million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of $9.0 million. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 36% to $36.5 million, primarily as a result of the sale of the LMPPG business, which reduced amortization expense by $10.6 million, and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year 2008, which reduced amortization expense by $6.6 million. Impairment charges increased to $1.3 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division. The remaining $146 million relates to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and a related trade name. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $27.8 million to $182.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of $11.4 million, lower professional fees of $7.2 million and lower advertising costs of $5.4 million. In addition, the sale of the LMPPG overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately $5 million. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 27% to $56.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances, which decreased interest income by $42.1 million, offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt, which increased interest income by $25.3 million. Interest expense increased 105% to $182.8 million as a result of higher debt levels. We raised $1.15 billion in May 2008 by issuing Equity Units, and $1.25 billion in January 2008 by issuing 2.5% convertible senior notes which resulted in an increase of approximately $108.9 million in interest expense, of which $25.8 million relates to the impact of a full year of imputed interest on our 2.5% convertible senior notes. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of $425 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes in July 2008 and lower interest rates paid on our term loan, which together resulted in a decrease of $28.6 million. Fund support losses increased $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of continued SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $116.0 million to a loss of $109.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $58.3 million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above, and $33.1 million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit was $1.2 billion compared to income tax expense of $173.5 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 38.4% in the current year compared to a 39.7% provision in the prior year. The current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits. In addition, the current year includes approximately $80 million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary, offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge. 48 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income, As Adjusted A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to cash income (loss), as adjusted (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ (1,967,918 ) $ 263,565 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 36,488 57,271 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 142,494 143,600 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) (56,187 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 32,340 6,544 Cash Income (Loss) (2,201,214 ) 414,793 Plus (Less): Net money market fund support losses(1) 1,376,579 313,726 Impairment charges 1,307,970 151,000 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Cash Income (Loss), as adjusted $ (1,191,389 ) $ 879,519 Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ (13.99 ) $ 1.83 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.26 0.40 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 1.01 0.99 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) (0.39 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.23 0.05 Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share (15.65 ) 2.88 Plus (Less): Net money market fund support losses(1) 9.79 2.18 Impairment charges 9.30 1.05 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, as adjusted $ (8.47 ) $ 6.11 (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit).

Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of operations. At March 31, 2010, our cash, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.5 billion, $8.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,427.7 $ 409.8 $ 1,144.9 Cash flows used for investing activities (276.7 ) (1,090.9 ) (2,103.3 ) Cash flows (used for) from financing activities (746.7 ) 329.2 1,220.0 Effect of exchange rate changes 19.5 (27.2 ) 18.4 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 423.8 (379.1 ) 280.0 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,084.5 1,463.6 1,183.6 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,508.3 $ 1,084.5 $ 1,463.6 Cash flows from operating activities were $1,427.7 million during fiscal 2010 compared to cash flows of $409.8 million for the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to approximately $1.04 billion of income tax refunds received during fiscal 2010. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the 50 Table of Contents amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support agreements. Cash outflows for financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million 5 year term loan and $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the Equity Units exchange offer, as described below, and the payment of cash dividends. We expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. We received approximately $580 million in tax refunds during the June 2009 quarter, primarily attributable to tax benefits from the utilization of $1.6 billion of realized losses incurred in fiscal 2009 on the sale of securities issued by SIVs. Federal legislation, enacted in November 2009 to extend the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years, enabled us to utilize an additional $1.3 billion of net operating loss deductions, and as a result, we received an additional $459 million in tax refunds in January 2010. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $359 million and future deductions for purchased goodwill and intangible assets aggregating approximately $3.5 billion will reduce future taxable income and related U.S. federal tax payments. We may elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities, including share repurchases, seed capital investments in new products, repayment of outstanding debt, or acquisitions. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million. It had been anticipated that these earnings would be used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. We intend to repatriate these remaining earnings in order to create lower taxed foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized. No further repatriation beyond the $225 million of foreign earnings is contemplated. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. We also currently have approximately $1 billion in free cash in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase common stock. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If this were to occur, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. In connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model, we expect to incur restructuring and transition related costs in the range of $190 to $210 million over the next two fiscal years. A portion of the restructuring and transition related costs, approximately 15%, will be paid in shares of restricted stock or the acceleration of other equity awards. We expect that, approximately 60% of these costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2011 and the remainder in fiscal 2012. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 to $150 million, and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, excluding costs incurred to achieve these savings. 51 Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2010: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Face Amount at March 31, 2010 Type 2010 2009 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,051,243 $ 1,016,798 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 103,039 1,150,000 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 LIBOR + 2.50% Repaid January 2010 In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% senior notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion have been used for general corporate purposes, primarily the purchase of SIV securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. The transaction increased the interest coverage ratio under our bank credit facilities as a result of lower interest expense. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2010 and 2009 of approximately $34.4 million and $32.3 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. The facility was scheduled to mature on October 14, 2010; however, in fiscal 2010, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to February 11, 2013. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. During January 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from $1 billion to $500 million and further modified covenants. In February 2010, we amended the credit agreement to extend the expiration of the 52 Table of Contents commitments and the maturity date of the loans, as discussed above, and further modified covenants, as discussed below. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately 0.36 million and 5.53 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately 0.36 and 5.53 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the acquisition of Citigroups asset management business in fiscal 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash, using capital raised through the sale of the 2.5% convertible senior notes discussed above. In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap ("Swap") to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The swap fully matured in December 2008. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. In order to complete the May 2008 issuance of the Equity Units, we received a waiver of the covenant that prevents us from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. We may not, subject to a few limited exceptions, incur more than $250 million in new indebtedness until we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness or we experience an increase in our trailing twelve month EBITDA. At March 31, 2010, our financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. The maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was decreased from 3.0 to 2.5 in a February 2010 amendment. In February 2010, the maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was also revised to reduce the minimum amount of unrestricted cash that is not deducted from outstanding debt in calculating the ratio under the covenant from $500 million to $375 million. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of $375 million, as discussed above. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, any non cash charges and up to $3.0 billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support. As of March 31, 2010, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 7.4. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2010. If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, use available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by three rating agencies: Moodys Investor Services ("Moodys"), Standard and Poors Rating Services ("Standard and Poors"), and Fitch Ratings. Our current Moodys rating is Baa1 with a stable outlook. Our current Standard and Poors rating is BBB+ with a negative outlook and our current Fitch rating is BBB+ with a stable outlook. In the event of downgrades by Moodys and or Standard and Poors, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the 53 Table of Contents acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We had the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right was not exercised, the holders of those equity interests had the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, representing earnout payments based upon Permals revenues through the second anniversary date and the purchase of 37.5% of the preference shares, of which $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in our common stock. During fiscal 2010, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, we paid an aggregate amount of $27.0 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. In July 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4.0 million shares of common stock from the proceeds of the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares discussed above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2010 and 2009. On May 10, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had replaced the July 2007 share repurchase authorization with a new authorization to purchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. On May 24, 2010, we announced that we entered into agreements to repurchase $300 million of our outstanding common stock in accelerated share repurchase transactions, which were funded with our available cash. We currently intend to use a portion of our available cash to purchase an additional approximately $100 million of our common stock by the end of fiscal 2011. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2010, we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In May 2010, all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares were exchanged for shares of our common stock. On April 27, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share, representing an increase of $0.01 per share over the prior four quarters. The dividend in fiscal 2010 was reduced significantly from fiscal 2009 in order to improve our flexibility to respond to cash needs and potential business opportunities requiring cash outflows. 54 Table of Contents Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2010 all support arrangements were terminated or expired. As of March 31, 2009, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: 2009 Earliest Transaction Date Description Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Capital Support Agreements(2) September 2008 $ 34,500 $ 34,500 Capital Support Agreements(3) October 2008 7,000 7,000 Total $ 41,500 $ 41,500 (1)Included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2)Pertains to Western Asset Institutional Money Market Fund, Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Euro Fund) and Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Sterling Fund). (3)Pertains to Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (USD Fund). During fiscal 2008, we entered into arrangements with two third party banks to provide letters of credit ("LOCs") for an aggregate amount of approximately $485 million for the benefit of three liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support four of these agreements, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. Additionally, one of the arrangements was supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2009, these LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $286 million in collateral was returned. During fiscal 2008, we entered into six capital support agreements ("CSAs"). Under the terms of the CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $415 million in support to two liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $415 million in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. During fiscal 2009, $200 million in principal amount of securities supported by one of these CSAs matured and were paid in full. The related CSA terminated in accordance with its terms and collateral of $15 million was returned. The remaining CSAs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the remaining $400 million in collateral was returned. Also during fiscal year 2008, we entered into a TRS arrangement with a major bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which the Bank purchased securities issued by three SIVs from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund managed by one of our subsidiaries. The $890 million in face amount of commercial paper was purchased by the Bank for cash at an aggregate amount of $832 million, which represents an estimate of value determined for collateral purposes. In addition, we reimbursed the fund for the $59.5 million difference between the funds carrying value, including accrued interest, and the amount paid and provided $139.5 million in cash collateral, which under the terms of the agreements could be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. 55 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to two liquidity funds in the form of two standby letters of credit in the total amount of approximately $257 million. We provided collateral equal to the total support amount under the LOCs. These LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the $257 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we entered into and amended various capital support agreements. Under the terms of the new and amended CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $1.07 billion in support to particular liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $1.07 billion in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. CSAs aggregating $1.03 billion terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $1.03 billion of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, $440 million in principal amount of securities previously supported under the TRS arrangement matured and were paid in full and an additional $95 million in principal amount of securities under the TRS arrangement was repaid. Also during fiscal 2009, non bank sponsored SIV securities purchased from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund in fiscal 2008 matured and $82 million in principal amount and interest was paid in full. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from six liquidity funds that were previously supported under twelve CSAs and seven LOCs. Upon the purchase of these securities, the twelve CSAs aggregating $1.4 billion and seven LOCs aggregating $742 million were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which includes the return of $1.03 billion and $257 million of collateral provided during the current fiscal year to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs, respectively. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by the TRS and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder and $42 million of collateral was returned. Credit and Liquidity Risk Cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 16 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, all of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2010, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS, which are fully described 56 Table of Contents above and in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Contingent Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 5.2 2.3 0.9 0.9 1,250.9 108.9 1,369.1 Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2) 46.4 39.0 38.9 38.9 38.8 45.4 247.4 Minimum rental and service commitments 139.2 121.8 107.2 88.6 80.4 593.1 1,130.3 Minimum commitments under capital leases(3) 31.8 1.9 33.7 Total Contractual Obligations 472.6 165.0 147.0 128.4 1,370.1 747.4 3,030.5 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(4) 2.2 2.2 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(5,6) $ 472.6 $ 165.0 $ 149.2 $ 128.4 $ 1,370.1 $ 747.4 $ 3,032.7 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if we have sufficient available cash that management elects to utilize for this purpose. (2)Interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2010. (3)The amount of commitments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the agreements. Fiscal 2011 includes $29.0 million related to a put/purchase option agreement with the owner of land and a building. We currently do not intend to purchase this land and building, which could result in the forfeiture of our $4 million escrow deposit. (4)The amount of contingent payments represents the fair value of the expected payment determined on the closing date of the acquisition, March 31, 2010. The maximum contingent payment that could be due in this fiscal year is $7.0 million. (5)The table above does not include approximately $45.7 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a general or limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal 2018. (6)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $42.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. 57  Table of Contents MARKET RISK The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non Trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products, and previously also included securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments prior to March 31, 2009. Trading investments at March 31, 2010 and 2009 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2010 2009 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 167,127 $ 128,785 Proprietary fund products and other investments 204,933 207,307 Total trading investments $ 372,060 $ 336,092 Approximately $149.8 million and $119.0 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading investments of $17.3 million and $9.8 million at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. Approximately $204.9 million and $207.3 million of trading assets at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $33.0 million and $46.3 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $17.7 million and $16.6 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are allocated to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment funds, and therefore do not impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $19.3 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. We 58 Table of Contents did not hedge risk on proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2009. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. Beginning in November 2007, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds. These arrangements included LOCs, CSAs, a TRS arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or the funds sold, all remaining securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure. Prior to the purchase, the majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit and a TRS. The various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and no losses were realized. Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2010 and 2009 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2010 2009 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 6,957 $ 6,818 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 136,469 59,515 Other investments 1,884 1,423 Total non trading assets $ 145,310 $ 67,756 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ $ 20,631 Investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2010 includes approximately $55.7 million of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program ("PPIP"). As previously discussed, by March 31, 2009, we effectively eliminated our exposure to SIVs. As of March 31, 2009, we recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $20.6 million, for which our exposure was limited to approximately $41.5 million. After the termination of these remaining fund support arrangements during fiscal 2010, we no longer have any exposure or additional potential losses related to supported securities. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." The elimination of SIV exposure from our Balance Sheet and money market funds as of March 31, 2009 substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk. See Notes 1, 17 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. 59 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2010: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase(1) Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease(1) Trading investments: Investment related to deferred compensation plans $ 167,127 $ 200,552 $ 133,702 Proprietary fund products and other 204,933 245,920 163,946 Total trading investment 372,060 446,472 297,648 Available for sale investments 6,957 8,348 5,566 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 136,469 163,763 109,175 Other investments 1,884 2,261 1,507 Total investments subject to market risk $ 517,370 $ 620,844 $ 413,896 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability, or noncontrolling interests. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $19.3 million have been hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $39.2 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings, respectively, as of March 31, 2010. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $253.6 million and $806 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2010, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other 60 Table of Contents securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2010, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $173.8 billion, $364.3 billion, and $146.4 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. The recent economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2010, less than 2% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. 61 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments were based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which supported investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of $20.6 million was included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No derivative asset was recorded as of March 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of $20.6 million were recovered. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, we owned approximately $48.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, we also have approximately $136.5 million and $59.5 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method, with the exception of $55.7 million of investments, as of March 31, 2010, related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys PPIP, which are recorded at fair value. The accounting guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which: prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. Previously, this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by SIVs. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions. 62  Table of Contents The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products are valued at NAV determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAV of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. As of March 31, 2010, approximately 2% of total assets (36% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2010 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 70,073 $ 9,050 $ 79,123 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,601,551 1,151,748 3,753,299 Trade names 7,700 62,100 69,800 Goodwill 910,959 404,337 1,315,296 $ 3,590,283 $ 1,627,235 $ 5,217,518 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. 63 Table of Contents Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2009, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of December 31, 2009. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2010, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2010, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 8 years with a weighted average life of approximately 4.3 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names. We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. 64 Table of Contents The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2009 annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 8%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 8% thereafter. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 14%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 9% thereafter. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 14.7% and 15.1%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 5% and 34%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15.2% and 18.8%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $144 million and $484 million, respectively. Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Americas and International divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. For our December 31, 2009 annual impairment test, the projected cash flows were discounted at 14.7% and 15.1%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 12%, with a longterm annual growth rate of approximately 9%. 65 Table of Contents Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 15%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Cash flow growth for the Americas and International divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections were based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods, in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and market influences relevant to their business. Long term growth of 9% for both divisions was based on our historical experience, available historic market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately 50% from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 6 and 7 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. As of December 31, 2009, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 1.5 million, 1.5 million, and 0.9 million stock options in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation 66 Table of Contents of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2010, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $611 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.0 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $116 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2010, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $212 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $49.2 million for fiscal year 2010. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. As of March 31, 2010, U.K. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, are not material. An additional valuation allowance was recorded on $2.9 million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Consolidation Special purpose entities ("SPEs") are trusts, partnerships, corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose. SPEs generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement, derive continued benefit, exhibit control or have recourse. We do not utilize SPEs as a form of financing or to provide liquidity, nor have we recognized any gains or losses from the sale of assets to SPEs. In accordance with accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"), SPEs are designated as either a voting interest entity or a VIE, with VIEs subject to consolidation by the party deemed to be the primary beneficiary, if any. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, either contractual or implied, or in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also considered VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the entity that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or if there is no such entity, the entity that will receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. In accordance with the accounting guidance, our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker. Under current guidance, it is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients unless our ownership interest, including interests of related parties, in a VIE is substantial, unless we may earn significant performance fees from the VIE or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest. The accounting guidance also requires the disclosure of VIEs in which we are a sponsor or are considered to have a significant variable interest. In determining whether a variable interest is significant, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary. In 67 Table of Contents determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned by and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows and credit and interest rate risks. These assumptions and estimates have a significant bearing on the determination of the primary beneficiary. If we, together with our related party relationships, are determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is consolidated within our financial statements. If our assumptions or estimates were to be materially incorrect, we might be required to consolidate additional VIEs. Consolidation of these VIEs would result in an increase in Assets with a corresponding increase in Noncontrolling interests or Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and a decrease in Investment advisory fees and an increase or decrease in Other non operating income (expense) with a corresponding offset in Noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but would have no impact on Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. As further discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are amendments and proposed amendments to consolidation accounting that may require us to consolidate additional VIEs or voting interest entities. As of March 31, 2010, we are the primary beneficiary of one sponsored investment fund VIE, which resulted in consolidation. This VIE had total assets and total equity of $52.7 million as of March 31, 2010, and $48.2 million as of March 31, 2009. Our investment in this VIE was $27.5 million and $26.3 million as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which represents our maximum risk of loss. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of variable interests. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; 68 Table of Contents the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values. See discussion of "Market Risks Revenues and Net Income" and "Critical Accounting Policies Intangible Assets and Goodwill" previously discussed.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. See "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk" for disclosure about market risk. 69  Table of Contents  
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management. We manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. Our division management reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer. The Americas division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. We believe this structure provides greater focus and allows us to maximize distribution efforts and more efficiently take advantage of growth opportunities locally and abroad. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset 32 Table of Contents management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The recent economic downturn contributed to a significant contraction in our business, although we have experienced improvement over the past year. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been dramatically impacted by the recent economic downturn, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the fixed income markets endured substantial turmoil. One effect of this turmoil was that liquidity in the markets for many types of asset backed commercial paper and medium term notes issued by structured investment vehicles ("SIVs") became substantially reduced. As a result, and to protect our clients, we entered into several arrangements during fiscal 2009 and 2008 to provide support to liquidity funds, managed by a subsidiary, that had invested in SIV securities. There were no arrangements remaining as of March 31, 2010. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States rebounded during fiscal 2010, but challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform and mixed economic data. The equity markets increased due to steady improvement in consumer confidence, stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates, and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors. During fiscal 2010, the Federal Reserve Board held the discount rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. Our results were positively impacted by many of these factors and the cost saving measures that began last fiscal year. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2011. We cannot predict how these uncertainties will impact the Companys results. All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the fiscal year as illustrated in the table below: Indices % Change for the year ended March 31, 2010 Dow Jones Industrial Average(1) 42.68 % S&P 500(2) 46.57 % NASDAQ Composite Index(3) 56.87 % Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index(4) 7.69 % Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index(4) 10.23 % (1)Dow Jones Industrial Average is a trademark of Dow Jones & Company, which is not affiliated with Legg Mason.

This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.4 billion of losses, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, related to the elimination of the exposure to SIVs in liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary in the prior fiscal year. The impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $863.4 million, net of income tax benefits, recorded in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the increase. Cash income, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to cash loss, as adjusted, of $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.7 billion of net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin increased to 12.2% from (19.9)% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to 20.6% from 23.8% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 2009 Beginning of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 38.8 43.7 Redemptions (40.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (76.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (82.0 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other(2) 134.1 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) End of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2010 were $685 billion, an increase of $52 billion or 8% from March 31, 2009. The increase in AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $134 billion, of which approximately 6% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, which was partially offset by net client outflows of $82 billion. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $64 billion, or 78% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $15 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset") and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC ("Brandywine") that had experienced past investment underperformance, although their performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010. We have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. ("Batterymarch"), The Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal") and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"). Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net equity outflows since fiscal 2007, although recent performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010 and the rate of outflows in this asset class has generally been lower in recent quarters. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. 35  Table of Contents Effective fiscal 2010, our alternative investment products are classified as investment funds for reporting purposes.

Although the unemployment rate remains high, the U.S. economy continues to slowly show signs of recovery. A strong rebound in corporate earnings, improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending, and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence. However, uncertainty in the markets remains, as best evidenced by the May 6, 2010 intraday sell off and subsequent rebound. With concerns regarding the credit quality of certain European nations, and as government stimulus initiatives continue globally, debates about inflation and deflation loom. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 61%, 72%, and 86%, respectively, of our marketed equity composite(2) assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88%, respectively, of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. In the fixed income markets, government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk. Most sector spreads declined in the past year as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities. Investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with 2000 basis points in excess returns over treasuries in 2009. (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 85% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 82% and 84%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. 37 Table of Contents For the 1 year period, the Treasury yield curve remains historically steep as the Federal Reserve continues to keep federal funds at close to 0%. The worst performing fixed income sector was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond returning (3.70)%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds which returned 58.21% for 2009. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 88%, 40%, 50%, and 88%, respectively, of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17%, respectively, of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 62%, 68%, 70%, and 80%, respectively, of our U.S. long term mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75%, respectively, of our U.S. long term mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 51%, 63%, 65%, and 78%, respectively, of our U.S. equity mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76%, respectively, of our U.S. equity mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average. As of March 31, 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 81%, 78%, 83%, and 87%, respectively, of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(3) assets outpaced their Lipper category average.

Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,866.9 70.9 $ 2,290.5 68.2 (18.5 ) International 768.0 29.1 1,066.9 31.8 (28.0 ) Total $ 2,634.9 100.0 $ 3,357.4 100.0 (21.5 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset, LMCM, and ClearBridge, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at Permal. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 were $2.6 billion, down 22% from $3.4 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 17% decrease in average AUM. The shift in the mix of average AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $202.4 million, or 20%, to $814.8 million. Of this decrease, $104.3 million was the result of lower average equity assets at ClearBridge, Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), LMCM and Brandywine, and $95.5 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 38 Table of Contents Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $469.1 million, or 26%, to $1.4 billion. Of this decrease, $309.2 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at Permal, LMCM, and ClearBridge, $73.1 million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors, and $66.9 million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset. Performance fees increased 310%, or $54.0 million, to $71.5 million during fiscal 2010, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset and Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 21% to $375.3 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund AUM and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses As a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal 2009 due to challenging market conditions, actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of promotional costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, with many of the more significant actions implemented in the December 2008 quarter. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2010 and 2009, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 2% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was driven by a $139.1 million decrease in revenue share based compensation, primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal 2010, the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates. The net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately $27.5 million. These reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $150.3 million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by gains in other non operating income (expense). Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.2% from 33.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 29% to $691.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 13% to $163.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a $13.6 million reduction in technology consulting fees, telecommunications and market data services. Reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense, which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2010, of $7.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, also contributed to the decrease. Occupancy expense decreased 25% to $157.0 million, primarily due to the recognition of $70.1 million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year, offset in part by a $19.3 million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 38% to $22.8 million, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2009, which reduced amortization expense by $13.5 million. Impairment charges were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and projected cash flows within that division. The remaining $146 million related to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and the impairment of a trade name. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $14.4 million to $167.6 million, primarily as a result of cost savings 39 Table of Contents initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of $15.6 million, and advertising costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.5 million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors. In May 2010, we announced a plan to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes: 1) transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates where they are closer to the actual client relationships and can be delivered with greater effectiveness; and 2) our Americas distribution group sharing in revenue on retail based AUM growth. This plan involves headcount reductions in operations, technology and other administrative areas at the corporate location, which may be partially offset by headcount increases at the affiliates, and will ultimately enable us to eliminate a portion of our corporate office space that was dedicated to our operations and technology employees. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 to $150 million, and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The initiative is projected to involve restructuring and transition related costs that will primarily include transition payments to affiliates (primarily compensation) to temporarily offset the cost of absorbing the services, charges for severance and retention incentives, and may also include costs for early contract terminations and asset disposals. The total expected costs are in the range of $190 to $210 million and will be incurred over the next two fiscal years. However, the achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements, as well as the amount of restructuring and transition related costs, will be subject to many factors, including market conditions and other factors affecting the financial results of the Company and our affiliates and the rate of AUM growth. In addition, our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support the business. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 87% to $7.4 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances, which reduced interest income by $36.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Interest expense decreased 31% to $126.3 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009, which reduced interest expense by $36.5 million, and a $24.6 million decrease due to the repayment of $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in March 2009, the repayment of our 6.75% senior notes in July 2008, the repayment of the $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million term loan in January 2010, as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal 2010. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily related to the early repayment of our $700 million term loan. Due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds, in fiscal 2010 we reversed unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 of $20.6 million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve SIVs. During fiscal 2009, fund support losses were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fund support. Other non operating income (expense) increased $213.5 million to income of $104.3 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.7 million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above, and $91.1 million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products, which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our Equity Units in fiscal 2010. Income Tax Benefit The provision for income taxes was $118.7 million compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 36.0% compared to a benefit rate of 38.4% in the prior year. The current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The prior years benefit rate was driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge, offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary. 40 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "cash income," "cash income, as adjusted," and "operating margin, as adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Cash Income (Loss), as Adjusted We define "cash income" as net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible asset impairment. We define "cash income, as adjusted" as cash income plus (less) net money market fund support losses (gains) and impairment charges less net losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities. We believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, provide good representations of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items as indicators of value that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, issued contingent convertible debt or made significant acquisitions, including any related goodwill or intangible asset impairments. We also believe that cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business. These measures are provided in addition to net income, but are not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of cash earnings or cash income, of other companies. Further, cash income and cash income, as adjusted, are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. Legg Mason considers cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to be useful to investors because they are important metrics in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as indicators of value that facilitate comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions, significant acquisitions, or issued contingent convertible debt. In calculating cash income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to net income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of Legg Masons operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill represent actual tax benefits that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we actually receive these tax benefits on indefinite life intangibles and goodwill over time, we add them to net income in the calculation of cash income. Conversely, we subtract the realized income tax benefits on impairment charges that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. In calculating cash income, as adjusted, we add (subtract) net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying SIV securities, if applicable) and impairment charges to cash income to reflect that these charges distort comparisons of Legg Masons operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. Should a disposition or impairment charge for indefinite life intangibles or goodwill occur, its impact on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on cash income and cash income, as adjusted, to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures. Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating cash income or cash income, as adjusted, because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 41 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to cash income (loss), as adjusted (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,769 36,488 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 136,252 142,494 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 34,445 32,340 Cash Income (Loss) 397,823 (2,201,214 ) Plus (Less): Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (16,565 ) 1,376,579 Impairment charges 1,307,970 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Cash Income (Loss), as adjusted $ 381,258 $ (1,191,389 ) Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.32 $ (13.99 ) Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.26 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 0.88 1.01 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.22 0.23 Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share 2.56 (15.65 ) Plus (Less): Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (0.11 ) 9.79 Impairment charges 9.30 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, as adjusted $ 2.45 $ (8.47 ) (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit). The increase in cash income (loss), as adjusted, was primarily due to the impact of net realized losses of $1.7 billion on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted We calculate "operating margin, as adjusted," by dividing (i) operating income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements and, impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues less distribution and servicing expenses that are passed through to third party distributors, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues." The compensation items are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on net income. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products. Legg Mason believes that operating margin, as adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what Legg Masons operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our 42 Table of Contents products. This measure is provided in addition to the Companys operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,634,879 $ 3,357,367 Less: Distribution and servicing expense 691,931 969,964 Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 1,942,948 $ 2,387,403 Operating Income (Loss) $ 321,183 $ (669,180 ) Add (Less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 79,316 (70,950 ) Impairment charges 1,307,970 Operating Income, as adjusted $ 400,499 $ 567,840 Operating margin, GAAP basis 12.2 % (19.9 )% Operating margin, as adjusted 20.6 23.8 Because operating margin, as adjusted, is a more relevant indicator of operating performance that management utilizes, we no longer present pre tax profit margin, as adjusted. 43  Table of Contents FISCAL 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2008 Financial Overview Net loss attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion, or $13.99 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $263.6 million, or $1.83 per diluted share in the prior year. During fiscal 2009, we eliminated the exposure to SIVs of all liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary by purchasing and subsequently selling, or reimbursing the funds for a portion of the losses they incurred in selling, all securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds and held by us. The majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit or a total return swap ("TRS") prior to the purchase. These transactions, along with charges related to remaining capital support arrangements that support securities other than SIVs, resulted in aggregate charges during the fiscal year of $2.3 billion. Also, during fiscal 2009, impairment charges of $1.3 billion were recorded, related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division, as a result of declines in the AUM and projected cash flows of affiliates in that division, and a reduction in the value of certain acquired management contract intangible assets and a related trade name. Cash loss, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, compared to cash income, as adjusted, of $879.5 million, or $6.11 per diluted share, in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009. The operating margin declined to (19.9%) from 22.7% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in fiscal 2009. The operating margin, as adjusted, declined to 23.8% from 35.5% in fiscal 2008. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 2008 Beginning of period $ 950.1 $ 968.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 43.7 54.2 Redemptions (78.6 ) (66.1 ) Separate account flows, net (109.0 ) (20.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (15.0 ) 5.7 Net client cash flows (158.9 ) (26.3 ) Market performance and other(2) (157.7 ) 9.9 Dispositions (1.1 ) (2.0 ) End of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2009 were $632.4 billion, a decrease of $317.7 billion or 33% from March 31, 2008. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $159 billion and market depreciation of $158 billion, of which approximately 10% was related to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation. There were net client outflows in all asset classes. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $89 billion, or 56% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $47 billion and $23 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset that experienced investment performance issues, particularly in fiscal 2009. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by key equity products managed at ClearBridge, LMCM and Permal. Effective fiscal 2010, our alternative investment products are classified as investment funds for reporting purposes. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

The markets were significantly impacted by the failure of major financial institutions, the freeze in the credit markets and unprecedented government intervention. In addition, the downturn in housing that led the U.S. into a broader slowdown set off financial turmoil. As a result, financial stocks led the equity markets lower, with the S&P 500 Financials Index down 63%, compared to the broader S&P 500 Index, which dropped 38%. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 49%, 53%, 58%, and 88% of our marketed equity composite(5) assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 53%, 53%, 49%, and 94% of our marketed equity composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. In the fixed income markets, the economic crisis deepened, but the governments numerous actions laid the foundation for a recovery, causing investor confidence to improve modestly late in the March 2009 quarter. The fiscal stimulus package designed to aid the economy, and the governments intention to issue more public debt for financing, caused yields to rise during the quarter. For the 1 year period, Treasury yields decreased significantly while long term rates increased resulting in a steeper yield curve. In addition, the worst performing sectors were home equity asset backed securities and investment grade corporate securities as measured by the Barclays ABS Home Equity Index returning (35)% and the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index returning (7)% for the 1 year period. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 31%, 12%, 32%, and 17% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods approximately 4%, 21%, 54%, and 74% of our marketed fixed income composite assets outpaced their benchmarks, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 43%, 52%, 47%, and 75% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 41%, 45%, 57%, and 85% of our U.S. long term mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 47%, 60%, 49%, and 76% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 45%, 50%, 50%, and 91% of our U.S. equity mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 38%, 41%, 45%, and 72% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods 33%, 34%, 67%, and 68% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund(6) assets outpaced their Lipper category average, respectively. (4)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (5)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2009, 85% of our equity assets under management and 84% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. As of March 31, 2008, 86% of our equity assets under management and 83% of our fixed income assets under management were in marketed composites. (6)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 46 Table of Contents Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change Americas $ 2,290.5 68.2 $ 3,217.2 69.4 (28.8 ) International 1,066.9 31.8 1,416.9 30.6 (24.7 ) Total $ 3,357.4 100.0 $ 4,634.1 100.0 (27.6 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by LMCM, ClearBridge, and Royce, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by PCM, ClearBridge and LMCM, and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to a decline in fund revenues and performance fees at Permal, lower separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from International balanced and fixed income funds. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009 were $3.4 billion, down 28% from $4.6 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of an 18% decrease in average AUM, due to a decline in average equity assets of approximately 38% and fixed income assets of approximately 12%. The shift in the mix of AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of fixed income and liquidity assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Operating revenues were also negatively impacted by a decline in performance fees of approximately $115.3 million, or 87%. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $447.3 million, or 31%, to $1.0 billion. Of this decrease, $273.1 million was the result of lower average equity assets at PCM, ClearBridge, LMCM and Brandywine, $80.9 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, and $43.9 million was the result of the sale of the Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") business. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the sale. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $483.4 million, or 21%, to $1.8 billion. Of this decrease, approximately $450 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at LMCM, ClearBridge, Permal, and Royce, approximately $76 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset, offset by approximately $42 million which was the result of increased liquidity assets managed, primarily at Western Asset. Performance fees decreased 87%, or $115.3 million, to $17.4 million during fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of a decrease in performance fees earned on alternative investment products at Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 31% to $475.0 million primarily as a result of a decline in average AUM of the retail share classes of our domestic and international equity funds, which resulted in a decrease of $176.7 million. Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a $341 million decrease in revenue share based compensation related to lower revenues in fiscal 2009; the impact of cost savings initiatives, such as reductions in headcount, discretionary incentives and other discretionary compensation that lowered compensation by approximately $86 million and a decrease in deferred compensation obligations of approximately $59 million resulting from market losses on invested assets of deferred compensation plans, which are largely offset by losses in other non operating income (expense). These decreases were offset in part by lower incentive compensation reductions of $40 million related to charges to provide support for certain liquidity funds that held SIV issued securities. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues decreased slightly to 33.7% from 33.9% in the prior fiscal year as compensation reductions related to unrealized market losses on deferred compensation plans were substantially offset by fixed compensation costs of 47 Table of Contents administrative and sales personnel which do not vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 24% to $970.0 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 2% to $188.3 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that led to an $11.3 million decrease in technology consulting fees, offset in part by a $4.1 million increase in market data costs for services previously included in Other expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in depreciation expense related to investment management infrastructure. Occupancy expense increased 62% to $209.5 million, primarily as a result of lease reserves related to office vacancies totaling $70.1 million and accelerated depreciation of assets in vacated space of $9.0 million. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 36% to $36.5 million, primarily as a result of the sale of the LMPPG business, which reduced amortization expense by $10.6 million, and the impact of the impairment of intangible assets in fiscal year 2008, which reduced amortization expense by $6.6 million. Impairment charges increased to $1.3 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and a reduction in projected cash flows of the division. The remaining $146 million relates to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and a related trade name. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. Other expenses decreased $27.8 million to $182.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that resulted in reduced travel and entertainment costs of $11.4 million, lower professional fees of $7.2 million and lower advertising costs of $5.4 million. In addition, the sale of the LMPPG overlay and implementation business eliminated support costs of approximately $5 million. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 27% to $56.3 million primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates earned on investment balances, which decreased interest income by $42.1 million, offset in part by higher average investment account balances due to proceeds from the issuance of debt, which increased interest income by $25.3 million. Interest expense increased 105% to $182.8 million as a result of higher debt levels. We raised $1.15 billion in May 2008 by issuing Equity Units, and $1.25 billion in January 2008 by issuing 2.5% convertible senior notes which resulted in an increase of approximately $108.9 million in interest expense, of which $25.8 million relates to the impact of a full year of imputed interest on our 2.5% convertible senior notes. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the repayment of $425 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes in July 2008 and lower interest rates paid on our term loan, which together resulted in a decrease of $28.6 million. Fund support losses increased $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of continued SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $116.0 million to a loss of $109.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $58.3 million in unrealized market losses on assets held in deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding compensation reductions discussed above, and $33.1 million in unrealized market losses on investments in proprietary fund products. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit was $1.2 billion compared to income tax expense of $173.5 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the losses related to liquidity fund support and charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 38.4% in the current year compared to a 39.7% provision in the prior year. The current year benefit rate is primarily driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits. In addition, the current year includes approximately $80 million in tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary, offset by the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge. 48 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Cash Income, As Adjusted A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to cash income (loss), as adjusted (in thousands except per share) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ (1,967,918 ) $ 263,565 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 36,488 57,271 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 142,494 143,600 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) (56,187 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 32,340 6,544 Cash Income (Loss) (2,201,214 ) 414,793 Plus (Less): Net money market fund support losses(1) 1,376,579 313,726 Impairment charges 1,307,970 151,000 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Cash Income (Loss), as adjusted $ (1,191,389 ) $ 879,519 Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ (13.99 ) $ 1.83 Plus (Less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.26 0.40 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets 1.01 0.99 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) (0.39 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.23 0.05 Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share (15.65 ) 2.88 Plus (Less): Net money market fund support losses(1) 9.79 2.18 Impairment charges 9.30 1.05 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Cash Income (Loss) per Diluted Share, as adjusted $ (8.47 ) $ 6.11 (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit).

Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of operations. At March 31, 2010, our cash, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.5 billion, $8.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,427.7 $ 409.8 $ 1,144.9 Cash flows used for investing activities (276.7 ) (1,090.9 ) (2,103.3 ) Cash flows (used for) from financing activities (746.7 ) 329.2 1,220.0 Effect of exchange rate changes 19.5 (27.2 ) 18.4 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 423.8 (379.1 ) 280.0 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,084.5 1,463.6 1,183.6 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,508.3 $ 1,084.5 $ 1,463.6 Cash flows from operating activities were $1,427.7 million during fiscal 2010 compared to cash flows of $409.8 million for the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to approximately $1.04 billion of income tax refunds received during fiscal 2010. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the 50 Table of Contents amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support agreements. Cash outflows for financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million 5 year term loan and $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the Equity Units exchange offer, as described below, and the payment of cash dividends. We expect that over the next twelve months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. We received approximately $580 million in tax refunds during the June 2009 quarter, primarily attributable to tax benefits from the utilization of $1.6 billion of realized losses incurred in fiscal 2009 on the sale of securities issued by SIVs. Federal legislation, enacted in November 2009 to extend the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years, enabled us to utilize an additional $1.3 billion of net operating loss deductions, and as a result, we received an additional $459 million in tax refunds in January 2010. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $359 million and future deductions for purchased goodwill and intangible assets aggregating approximately $3.5 billion will reduce future taxable income and related U.S. federal tax payments. We may elect to utilize our available resources for any number of activities, including share repurchases, seed capital investments in new products, repayment of outstanding debt, or acquisitions. During fiscal 2008, we initiated a plan to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million. It had been anticipated that these earnings would be used for the contingent acquisition payment in the U.S. to the former owners of Permal. We repatriated approximately $36 million of these funds during fiscal 2008. We intend to repatriate these remaining earnings in order to create lower taxed foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized. No further repatriation beyond the $225 million of foreign earnings is contemplated. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. We also currently have approximately $1 billion in free cash in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase common stock. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, currently unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If this were to occur, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. In connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model, we expect to incur restructuring and transition related costs in the range of $190 to $210 million over the next two fiscal years. A portion of the restructuring and transition related costs, approximately 15%, will be paid in shares of restricted stock or the acceleration of other equity awards. We expect that, approximately 60% of these costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2011 and the remainder in fiscal 2012. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 to $150 million, and expect to achieve the savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, excluding costs incurred to achieve these savings. 51 Table of Contents Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2010: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Face Amount at March 31, 2010 Type 2010 2009 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,051,243 $ 1,016,798 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 103,039 1,150,000 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013 5 year term loan 700,000 550,000 LIBOR + 2.50% Repaid January 2010 In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% senior notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. The holders also receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment on the purchase contract at an annual rate of 1.4% of the commitment amount and are required to pledge their interests in the senior notes to us as collateral on their purchase commitment. The net proceeds from the Equity Units offering of approximately $1.11 billion have been used for general corporate purposes, primarily the purchase of SIV securities from liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary and repayment of outstanding debt. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. The transaction increased the interest coverage ratio under our bank credit facilities as a result of lower interest expense. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2010 and 2009 of approximately $34.4 million and $32.3 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. The facility was scheduled to mature on October 14, 2010; however, in fiscal 2010, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to February 11, 2013. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. During January 2008, we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount that we may borrow from $500 million to $1 billion. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and amended the credit agreement to decrease the maximum amount that we may borrow from $1 billion to $500 million and further modified covenants. In February 2010, we amended the credit agreement to extend the expiration of the 52 Table of Contents commitments and the maturity date of the loans, as discussed above, and further modified covenants, as discussed below. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately 0.36 million and 5.53 million common shares, respectively, upon conversion of approximately 0.36 and 5.53 shares, respectively, of the convertible preferred stock that was issued in the acquisition of Citigroups asset management business in fiscal 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 2.5 shares (convertible into 2.5 million common shares) of the convertible preferred stock for approximately $180 million in cash, using capital raised through the sale of the 2.5% convertible senior notes discussed above. In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. Effective with the closing of the Citigroup transaction, we entered into a $400 million three year amortizing interest rate swap ("Swap") to hedge a portion of the $700 million floating rate term loan at a fixed rate of 4.9%. During the March 2007 quarter, this swap began to unwind in accordance with its terms and we repaid a corresponding $50 million of the debt. During fiscal 2008, we repaid $100 million of the debt. The swap fully matured in December 2008. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. In order to complete the May 2008 issuance of the Equity Units, we received a waiver of the covenant that prevents us from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. We may not, subject to a few limited exceptions, incur more than $250 million in new indebtedness until we have substantially reduced our outstanding indebtedness or we experience an increase in our trailing twelve month EBITDA. At March 31, 2010, our financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. The maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was decreased from 3.0 to 2.5 in a February 2010 amendment. In February 2010, the maximum debt to EBITDA ratio was also revised to reduce the minimum amount of unrestricted cash that is not deducted from outstanding debt in calculating the ratio under the covenant from $500 million to $375 million. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of $375 million, as discussed above. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, any non cash charges and up to $3.0 billion in realized losses resulting from liquidity fund support. As of March 31, 2010, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 7.4. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2010. If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, use available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seek to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently rated investment grade by three rating agencies: Moodys Investor Services ("Moodys"), Standard and Poors Rating Services ("Standard and Poors"), and Fitch Ratings. Our current Moodys rating is Baa1 with a stable outlook. Our current Standard and Poors rating is BBB+ with a negative outlook and our current Fitch rating is BBB+ with a stable outlook. In the event of downgrades by Moodys and or Standard and Poors, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase. Effective November 1, 2005, we acquired 80% of the outstanding equity of Permal. Concurrent with the 53 Table of Contents acquisition, Permal completed a reorganization in which the residual 20% of outstanding equity was converted to preference shares, resulting in Legg Mason owning 100% of the outstanding voting common stock of Permal. We had the right to purchase the preference shares over the four years subsequent to the closing and, if that right was not exercised, the holders of those equity interests had the right to require us to purchase the interests in the same general time frame for approximately the same consideration. The maximum aggregate price, including earnout payments related to each purchase and based upon future revenue levels, for all equity interests in Permal is $1.386 billion, excluding acquisition costs and dividends. During fiscal 2008, payments of $240 million were made to the former owners of Permal, representing earnout payments based upon Permals revenues through the second anniversary date and the purchase of 37.5% of the preference shares, of which $208 million was paid in cash and the balance was in our common stock. During fiscal 2010, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, we paid an aggregate amount of $27.0 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill. On August 1, 2001, we purchased PCM for cash of approximately $682 million, excluding acquisition costs. The transaction included two contingent payments based on PCMs revenue growth for the years ending on the third and fifth anniversaries of closing, with the aggregate purchase price to be no more than $1.382 billion. During fiscal 2005, we made the maximum third anniversary payment of $400 million to the former owners of PCM. During fiscal 2007, we paid from available cash into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. In fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us, at our discretion, to purchase up to 3.0 million shares of our common stock. During the June 2007 quarter, we repurchased 40,150 shares for $4.0 million. In July 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock to replace the previous share repurchase authorization. In January 2008, the Board of Directors also authorized us to repurchase non voting convertible preferred stock representing up to 4.0 million shares of common stock from the proceeds of the convertible senior notes discussed above. In February 2008, we repurchased and retired preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million shares of common stock for $180 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $94 million under the new authorization, in addition to the 40,150 shares discussed above. There were no repurchases during fiscal 2010 and 2009. On May 10, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had replaced the July 2007 share repurchase authorization with a new authorization to purchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. On May 24, 2010, we announced that we entered into agreements to repurchase $300 million of our outstanding common stock in accelerated share repurchase transactions, which were funded with our available cash. We currently intend to use a portion of our available cash to purchase an additional approximately $100 million of our common stock by the end of fiscal 2011. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2010, we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In May 2010, all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares were exchanged for shares of our common stock. On April 27, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share, representing an increase of $0.01 per share over the prior four quarters. The dividend in fiscal 2010 was reduced significantly from fiscal 2009 in order to improve our flexibility to respond to cash needs and potential business opportunities requiring cash outflows. 54 Table of Contents Certain of our asset management subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such subsidiaries met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2010 all support arrangements were terminated or expired. As of March 31, 2009, the support amounts and related cash collateral (in thousands) were as follows: 2009 Earliest Transaction Date Description Support Amount Cash Collateral(1) Capital Support Agreements(2) September 2008 $ 34,500 $ 34,500 Capital Support Agreements(3) October 2008 7,000 7,000 Total $ 41,500 $ 41,500 (1)Included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2)Pertains to Western Asset Institutional Money Market Fund, Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Euro Fund) and Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (Sterling Fund). (3)Pertains to Western (formerly Citi) Institutional Liquidity Fund P.L.C. (USD Fund). During fiscal 2008, we entered into arrangements with two third party banks to provide letters of credit ("LOCs") for an aggregate amount of approximately $485 million for the benefit of three liquidity funds managed by one of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the LOC arrangements, we agreed to reimburse to the banks any amounts that may be drawn on the LOCs and, to support four of these agreements, we provided approximately $286 million in cash collateral as of March 31, 2008. Additionally, one of the arrangements was supported with $150 million in excess capacity on our revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2009, these LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $286 million in collateral was returned. During fiscal 2008, we entered into six capital support agreements ("CSAs"). Under the terms of the CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $415 million in support to two liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $415 million in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. During fiscal 2009, $200 million in principal amount of securities supported by one of these CSAs matured and were paid in full. The related CSA terminated in accordance with its terms and collateral of $15 million was returned. The remaining CSAs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the remaining $400 million in collateral was returned. Also during fiscal year 2008, we entered into a TRS arrangement with a major bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which the Bank purchased securities issued by three SIVs from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund managed by one of our subsidiaries. The $890 million in face amount of commercial paper was purchased by the Bank for cash at an aggregate amount of $832 million, which represents an estimate of value determined for collateral purposes. In addition, we reimbursed the fund for the $59.5 million difference between the funds carrying value, including accrued interest, and the amount paid and provided $139.5 million in cash collateral, which under the terms of the agreements could be increased or decreased based on changes in the value, or upon maturities, of the underlying securities. 55 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to two liquidity funds in the form of two standby letters of credit in the total amount of approximately $257 million. We provided collateral equal to the total support amount under the LOCs. These LOCs terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and the $257 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we entered into and amended various capital support agreements. Under the terms of the new and amended CSAs, we agreed to provide up to a maximum of $1.07 billion in support to particular liquidity funds in certain circumstances upon the funds realizing a loss from specific underlying securities. We provided $1.07 billion in collateral to support each CSA up to the maximum contribution amount. CSAs aggregating $1.03 billion terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase of the underlying securities from the funds, as described below, and $1.03 billion of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, $440 million in principal amount of securities previously supported under the TRS arrangement matured and were paid in full and an additional $95 million in principal amount of securities under the TRS arrangement was repaid. Also during fiscal 2009, non bank sponsored SIV securities purchased from a Dublin domiciled liquidity fund in fiscal 2008 matured and $82 million in principal amount and interest was paid in full. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from six liquidity funds that were previously supported under twelve CSAs and seven LOCs. Upon the purchase of these securities, the twelve CSAs aggregating $1.4 billion and seven LOCs aggregating $742 million were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which includes the return of $1.03 billion and $257 million of collateral provided during the current fiscal year to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs, respectively. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by the TRS and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder and $42 million of collateral was returned. Credit and Liquidity Risk Cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Variable Interest Entities and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 16 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, all of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2010, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS, which are fully described 56 Table of Contents above and in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Contingent Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity 5.2 2.3 0.9 0.9 1,250.9 108.9 1,369.1 Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2) 46.4 39.0 38.9 38.9 38.8 45.4 247.4 Minimum rental and service commitments 139.2 121.8 107.2 88.6 80.4 593.1 1,130.3 Minimum commitments under capital leases(3) 31.8 1.9 33.7 Total Contractual Obligations 472.6 165.0 147.0 128.4 1,370.1 747.4 3,030.5 Contingent Obligations Contingent payments related to business acquisitions(4) 2.2 2.2 Total Contractual and Contingent Obligations(5,6) $ 472.6 $ 165.0 $ 149.2 $ 128.4 $ 1,370.1 $ 747.4 $ 3,032.7 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if we have sufficient available cash that management elects to utilize for this purpose. (2)Interest on floating rate long term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2010. (3)The amount of commitments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the agreements. Fiscal 2011 includes $29.0 million related to a put/purchase option agreement with the owner of land and a building. We currently do not intend to purchase this land and building, which could result in the forfeiture of our $4 million escrow deposit. (4)The amount of contingent payments represents the fair value of the expected payment determined on the closing date of the acquisition, March 31, 2010. The maximum contingent payment that could be due in this fiscal year is $7.0 million. (5)The table above does not include approximately $45.7 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a general or limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods that range through fiscal 2018. (6)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $42.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. 57  Table of Contents MARKET RISK The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our subsidiaries retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which subsidiaries generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non Trading Assets and Liabilities Our trading and non trading assets and liabilities are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, derivative instruments, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products, and previously also included securities issued by SIVs and other conduit investments prior to March 31, 2009. Trading investments at March 31, 2010 and 2009 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2010 2009 Investment securities: Investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 167,127 $ 128,785 Proprietary fund products and other investments 204,933 207,307 Total trading investments $ 372,060 $ 336,092 Approximately $149.8 million and $119.0 million of trading investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it may have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading investments of $17.3 million and $9.8 million at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans and the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. Approximately $204.9 million and $207.3 million of trading assets at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $33.0 million and $46.3 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $17.7 million and $16.6 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are allocated to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment funds, and therefore do not impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $19.3 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2010 are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. We 58 Table of Contents did not hedge risk on proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2009. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. Beginning in November 2007, we entered into a series of arrangements to provide credit support to certain liquidity funds. These arrangements included LOCs, CSAs, a TRS arrangement and the purchase of securities issued by SIVs and other conduits, all of which substantially increased our exposure to the risk of security price fluctuations. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or the funds sold, all remaining securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure. Prior to the purchase, the majority of these SIV securities were supported under capital support arrangements, letters of credit and a TRS. The various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and no losses were realized. Non trading assets and liabilities at March 31, 2010 and 2009 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2010 2009 Investment securities: Available for sale $ 6,957 $ 6,818 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 136,469 59,515 Other investments 1,884 1,423 Total non trading assets $ 145,310 $ 67,756 Derivative liabilities: Fund support arrangements $ $ 20,631 Investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2010 includes approximately $55.7 million of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program ("PPIP"). As previously discussed, by March 31, 2009, we effectively eliminated our exposure to SIVs. As of March 31, 2009, we recorded derivative liabilities on fund support arrangements of $20.6 million, for which our exposure was limited to approximately $41.5 million. After the termination of these remaining fund support arrangements during fiscal 2010, we no longer have any exposure or additional potential losses related to supported securities. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." The elimination of SIV exposure from our Balance Sheet and money market funds as of March 31, 2009 substantially reduced the sensitivity of our financial position to market risk. See Notes 1, 17 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and liquidity fund support actions. 59 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2010: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase(1) Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease(1) Trading investments: Investment related to deferred compensation plans $ 167,127 $ 200,552 $ 133,702 Proprietary fund products and other 204,933 245,920 163,946 Total trading investment 372,060 446,472 297,648 Available for sale investments 6,957 8,348 5,566 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 136,469 163,763 109,175 Other investments 1,884 2,261 1,507 Total investments subject to market risk $ 517,370 $ 620,844 $ 413,896 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability, or noncontrolling interests. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $19.3 million have been hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $39.2 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings, respectively, as of March 31, 2010. Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our comprehensive income or net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately $253.6 million and $806 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2010, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be among our current accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other 60 Table of Contents securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2010, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $173.8 billion, $364.3 billion, and $146.4 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. The recent economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2010, less than 2% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. 61 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we entered into various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments were based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which supported investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding for which a derivative liability of $20.6 million was included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No derivative asset was recorded as of March 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of $20.6 million were recovered. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. For trading and non trading investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, we owned approximately $48.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively, of trading and non trading financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, we also have approximately $136.5 million and $59.5 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are generally accounted for under the cost or equity method, with the exception of $55.7 million of investments, as of March 31, 2010, related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys PPIP, which are recorded at fair value. The accounting guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which: prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. Previously, this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by SIVs. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions. 62  Table of Contents The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products are valued at NAV determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAV of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. As of March 31, 2010, approximately 2% of total assets (36% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2010 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 70,073 $ 9,050 $ 79,123 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,601,551 1,151,748 3,753,299 Trade names 7,700 62,100 69,800 Goodwill 910,959 404,337 1,315,296 $ 3,590,283 $ 1,627,235 $ 5,217,518 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. 63 Table of Contents Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2009, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of December 31, 2009. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2010, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2010, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 8 years with a weighted average life of approximately 4.3 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names. We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. 64 Table of Contents The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2009 annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 8%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 8% thereafter. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 14%, with a long term annual rate of approximately 9% thereafter. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 14.7% and 15.1%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 5% and 34%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15.2% and 18.8%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $144 million and $484 million, respectively. Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Americas and International divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected current and long term cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. For our December 31, 2009 annual impairment test, the projected cash flows were discounted at 14.7% and 15.1%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, were assumed to have a 5 year average annual growth rate of approximately 12%, with a longterm annual growth rate of approximately 9%. 65 Table of Contents Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 15%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Cash flow growth for the Americas and International divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections were based on historical recovery trends following prior recessionary periods, in context with our long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and market influences relevant to their business. Long term growth of 9% for both divisions was based on our historical experience, available historic market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately 50% from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 6 and 7 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. As of December 31, 2009, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 1.5 million, 1.5 million, and 0.9 million stock options in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and in part upon the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option is held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes Legg Mason and its subsidiaries are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation 66 Table of Contents of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2010, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $611 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.0 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $116 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using the same assumptions as those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2010, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $212 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $49.2 million for fiscal year 2010. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. As of March 31, 2010, U.K. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, are not material. An additional valuation allowance was recorded on $2.9 million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Consolidation Special purpose entities ("SPEs") are trusts, partnerships, corporations or other vehicles that are established for a limited business purpose. SPEs generally involve the transfer of assets and liabilities in which the transferor may or may not have continued involvement, derive continued benefit, exhibit control or have recourse. We do not utilize SPEs as a form of financing or to provide liquidity, nor have we recognized any gains or losses from the sale of assets to SPEs. In accordance with accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"), SPEs are designated as either a voting interest entity or a VIE, with VIEs subject to consolidation by the party deemed to be the primary beneficiary, if any. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, either contractual or implied, or in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also considered VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the entity that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or if there is no such entity, the entity that will receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. In accordance with the accounting guidance, our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker. Under current guidance, it is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients unless our ownership interest, including interests of related parties, in a VIE is substantial, unless we may earn significant performance fees from the VIE or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest. The accounting guidance also requires the disclosure of VIEs in which we are a sponsor or are considered to have a significant variable interest. In determining whether a variable interest is significant, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary. In 67 Table of Contents determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned by and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows and credit and interest rate risks. These assumptions and estimates have a significant bearing on the determination of the primary beneficiary. If we, together with our related party relationships, are determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is consolidated within our financial statements. If our assumptions or estimates were to be materially incorrect, we might be required to consolidate additional VIEs. Consolidation of these VIEs would result in an increase in Assets with a corresponding increase in Noncontrolling interests or Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and a decrease in Investment advisory fees and an increase or decrease in Other non operating income (expense) with a corresponding offset in Noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but would have no impact on Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. As further discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are amendments and proposed amendments to consolidation accounting that may require us to consolidate additional VIEs or voting interest entities. As of March 31, 2010, we are the primary beneficiary of one sponsored investment fund VIE, which resulted in consolidation. This VIE had total assets and total equity of $52.7 million as of March 31, 2010, and $48.2 million as of March 31, 2009. Our investment in this VIE was $27.5 million and $26.3 million as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which represents our maximum risk of loss. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of variable interests.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, anticipated future investment performance of our subsidiaries, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; 68 Table of Contents the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.
