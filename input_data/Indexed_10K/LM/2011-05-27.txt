MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We currently operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, and manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. The Americas division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team which, among other things, will eliminate the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions into one Global Asset Management business during fiscal 2012. We believe this new structure will allow us to function as a global organization with a single purpose and allow us to focus on future growth opportunities. As of March 31, 2011, there has been no change to the internal executive management reporting and we continued to operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, with two divisions, Americas and International. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. In addition, from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other 28 Table of Contents arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The economic downturn of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contributed to a significant contraction in our business. We have experienced improvement over the past two years, although we have not recovered to pre downturn levels. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States continued to rebound during fiscal 2011, but challenging conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding the strength of the economic recovery, continued concerns over budget deficits, and high levels of unemployment. The impact of the earthquake that occurred in Japan in March 2011, along with political unrest in the Middle East, have created new uncertainties. In spite of these global concerns, the markets continued to increase due to steady improvement in consumer confidence, stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates, and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors. During fiscal 2011, the Federal Reserve Board held the discount rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2012. All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below: % Change for the year ended March 31, Indices(1) 2011 2010 Dow Jones Industrial Average 13.48 % 42.68 % S&P 500 13.37 % 46.57 % NASDAQ Composite Index 15.98 % 56.87 % Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 5.12 % 7.69 % Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index 7.15 % 10.23 % (1)Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. 29 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change(1) 2011 Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 29.3 % 30.9 % 30.3 % 0.1 % (19.9 )% Funds 53.4 51.9 54.7 8.7 (25.5 ) Performance fees 3.5 2.7 0.5 35.3 310.0 Distribution and service fees 13.6 14.3 14.2 1.0 (21.0 ) Other 0.2 0.2 0.3 4.6 (47.6 ) Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 5.7 (21.5 ) Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 41.0 42.2 33.7 2.6 (1.8 ) Transition related compensation 1.6 n/m n/m Total compensation and benefits 42.6 42.2 33.7 6.7 (1.8 ) Distribution and servicing 25.6 26.3 28.9 3.0 (28.7 ) Communications and technology 5.8 6.2 5.6 (0.7 ) (13.4 ) Occupancy 5.0 6.0 6.2 (12.2 ) (25.1 ) Amortization of intangible assets 0.8 0.8 1.1 0.6 (37.6 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 39.0 n/m n/m Other 6.3 6.3 5.4 5.3 (7.9 ) Total operating expenses 86.1 87.8 119.9 3.6 (42.5 ) Operating Income (Loss) 13.9 12.2 (19.9 ) 20.4 n/m Other Income (Expense) Interest income 0.3 0.3 1.7 25.7 (86.9 ) Interest expense (3.3 ) (4.8 ) (5.5 ) (27.0 ) (30.9 ) Fund support 0.9 (68.0 ) n/m n/m Other 2.1 3.2 (3.5 ) (31.4 ) n/m Other non operating income (expense) of consolidated investment vehicles 0.1 0.7 0.2 (90.2 ) n/m Total other income (expense) (0.8 ) 0.3 (75.1 ) n/m n/m Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 13.1 12.5 (95.0 ) 10.8 n/m Income tax provision (benefit) 4.3 4.5 (36.5 ) 0.6 n/m Net Income (Loss) 8.8 8.0 (58.5 ) 16.5 n/m Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.3 ) 0.2 0.1 n/m n/m Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. 9.1 % 7.8 % (58.6 )% 24.3 n/m n/m not meaningful (1)Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 30 Table of Contents FISCAL 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2010 Financial Overview Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2011 totaled $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase in Net Income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues, reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees, reduced interest expense, and a change in the U.K. tax rate. These increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation, the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year, and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Net Income, as previously discussed, excluding the impact of the current year U.K. tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year. Operating margin increased to 13.9% from 12.2% in the prior year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) increased to 23.2% from 20.7% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 2010 Beginning of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 49.5 38.8 Redemptions (44.3 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (52.1 ) (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2 ) (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (61.1 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other(2) 56.3 134.1 Dispositions (2.1 ) End of period $ 677.6 $ 684.5 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2011 was $678 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 1% from March 31, 2010. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $61 billion, which were partially offset by market appreciation of $56 billion, of which approximately 17% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, and dispositions of $2 billion, relating to the sale of a Singapore based Asian equity manager. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $37 billion, or 61% of the outflows, followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of $16 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset"). We have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge") and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"), while The Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal") and Royce & Associates ("Royce) had net inflows. Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net annual equity outflows since fiscal 2007. However, the rate of outflows in this asset class was lower year over year. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney amended certain historical Smith Barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage, that resulted in a reduction of approximately $16 billion in liquidity AUM. We are currently waiving much of the management fees generated by these assets, so a loss of this AUM this year would have reduced net advisory revenue by only $8 million and not had a material impact on Net Income due to the impact of revenue sharing arrangements and income taxes. In addition, we expect further amendments to result in an additional $7 billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next 15 months. Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. 31  Table of Contents AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Equity $ 189.6 28.0 $ 173.8 25.4 9.1 Fixed income 356.6 52.6 364.3 53.2 (2.1 ) Liquidity 131.4 19.4 146.4 21.4 (10.2 ) Total $ 677.6 100.0 $ 684.5 100.0 (1.0 ) The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2010 $ 173.8 $ 364.3 $ 146.4 $ 684.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 23.4 26.1 49.5 Redemptions (24.7 ) (19.6 ) (44.3 ) Separate account flows, net (6.9 ) (43.5 ) (1.7 ) (52.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2 ) (14.2 ) Net client cash flows (8.2 ) (37.0 ) (15.9 ) (61.1 ) Market performance and other 24.0 29.3 0.9 54.2 March 31, 2011 $ 189.6 $ 356.6 $ 131.4 $ 677.6 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Equity $ 173.8 26.0 $ 155.7 23.0 11.6 Fixed income 361.6 54.0 370.7 54.9 (2.5 ) Liquidity 133.8 20.0 149.1 22.1 (10.3 ) Total $ 669.2 100.0 $ 675.5 100.0 (0.9 ) AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Americas $ 476.8 70.4 $ 475.8 69.5 0.2 International 200.8 29.6 208.7 30.5 (3.8 ) Total $ 677.6 100.0 $ 684.5 100.0 (1.0 ) 32 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2011 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2010 $ 475.8 $ 208.7 $ 684.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 28.7 20.8 49.5 Redemptions (32.6 ) (11.7 ) (44.3 ) Separate account flows, net (32.0 ) (20.1 ) (52.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (8.1 ) (6.1 ) (14.2 ) Net client cash flows (44.0 ) (17.1 ) (61.1 ) Market performance and other 45.0 9.2 54.2 March 31, 2011 $ 476.8 $ 200.8 $ 677.6 Investment Performance(1) Investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2011 was mixed compared to relevant bench marks from the prior year. The equity markets worked through a difficult year with more recent political upheaval in the Middle East driving a significant increase in oil prices and the earthquake in Japan and subsequent nuclear crisis raising questions about the future of the nuclear power industry. Despite these global concerns, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our fourth fiscal quarter and our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions activity. In the fixed income markets, relatively strong economic data, combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise across the yield curve. The yield curve slightly flattened over the quarter and the year as the Federal Reserve kept its funds rate at 0.25% and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period. The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond Index returning 4.28%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Bond Index, which returned 14.31% followed by U.S. TIPS, as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which returned 7.91% for the year. The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Equity 42 % 57 % 61 % 77 % 49 % 61 % 72 % 86 % Fixed income 82 % 80 % 70 % 81 % 88 % 40 % 50 % 88 % (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, 89% and 87% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 89% and 82%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. 33 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category averages as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Total long term 56 % 74 % 70 % 67 % 62 % 68 % 70 % 80 % Equity 58 % 70 % 68 % 60 % 51 % 63 % 65 % 78 % Fixed income 52 % 83 % 78 % 85 % 81 % 78 % 83 % 87 % Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,917.9 68.9 $ 1,864.2 70.8 2.9 International 866.4 31.1 770.7 29.2 12.4 Total $ 2,784.3 100.0 $ 2,634.9 100.0 5.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Royce. The increase in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees and performance fees on assets managed by the international operations of Western Asset and increased fund revenues at Permal. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 34 Table of Contents Business Model Streamlining Initiative In May 2010, we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes: (i) transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships; and (ii) sharing in affiliate revenue with our Americas distribution group. We project that the initiative will result in $130 million to $150 million in expense reductions that will be fully realized on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These expense savings consist of (i) approximately $75 million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates, and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements; (ii) approximately $50 million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units, including savings associated with consolidating office space; and (iii) approximately $15 million from our Americas distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements. The initiative involves approximately $115 million to $135 million in transition related costs that primarily include charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period. The transition related costs will also include charges for consolidating leased office space, early contract terminations, asset disposals and professional fees. During fiscal 2011, transition related costs totaled $54.4 million, which, net of related cost savings, reduced our operating income by $42 million. Substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal 2012. The nature and amount of transition costs and savings are based on estimates. While management expects the total costs and savings to be within the ranges disclosed, actual results may differ in amount and nature from these estimates. The achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements, as well as the amount and nature of transition related costs, will be subject to many factors, including market conditions and other factors affecting our financial results, and those of our affiliates, and the rate of AUM growth. In addition, our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support our business. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of a new accounting standard on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity ("CLO"). The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non operating income (expense), is reflected in our Net Income, net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the consolidation of investment vehicles is presented in our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles" (See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information). Also, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles. Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2011 were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from $2.6 billion in the prior year, despite a 1% decrease in average AUM, reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees. These increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at $815.6 million, as a decrease of $25.4 million, resulting from lower average fixed income assets at Western Asset, was offset by an $18.6 million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. ("Batterymarch") and Royce, a $5.1 million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine Global Management, LLC ("Brandywine"), and a $2.2 million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain CLOs managed by Western Asset. Investment advisory fees from funds increased $119.3 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion. Of this increase, $111.5 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at Royce, Permal, and ClearBridge, and 35 Table of Contents $84.4 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset and a $36.0 million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset, primarily to maintain certain yields to investors. Performance fees increased 35%, or $25.2 million, to $96.7 million during fiscal 2011, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine. Distribution and service fees increased 1% to $379.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses Total compensation and benefits increased $74.1 million to $1.2 billion. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation of $45.0 million, which represents severance and retention incentive costs, increased $29.0 million, or 3%, to $1.14 billion. This increase was driven by a $68.6 million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal 2011 and a $7.5 million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are recorded in Other non operating income (expense), as well as, a $6.1 million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates. The impact of reduced headcount, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives, also reduced compensation and benefits by $6.0 million. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.6% from 42.2% in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation, and transition related compensation. These increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues. We have an arrangement with an affiliate under which the affiliates incentive compensation pool under a revenue sharing agreement has been reduced over the last two years to reimburse the parent company for certain expenses, while at the same time the parent company has provided an equivalent amount of deferred compensation to the affiliates employees. A portion of the deferred compensation was granted in the form of restricted stock awards and the remainder in cash awards granted under a non qualified plan, both of which will vest over periods of three to four years. The amount by which the affiliates incentive compensation will be reduced in fiscal 2012 under the arrangement will be significantly less than the reduction in fiscal 2011. In addition, there will be an increase in the amount of non cash amortization expense associated with the vesting of the deferred compensation awards from prior years. The combined impact will result in a $74 million increase in compensation and benefits in fiscal 2012, which will be recognized ratably over the year. This arrangement will continue for the subsequent five years, however, the incremental effect on compensation expense from year to year will be far less significant. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 3% to $712.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of $14.5 million in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 1% to $162.0 million, of which $9.2 million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during the current year, offset in part by a $6.6 million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives. Occupancy expense decreased 12% to $137.9 million, primarily due to the impact of a $19.3 million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at $22.9 million. Other expenses increased $8.9 million to $176.6 million, primarily as a result of a $10.3 million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs, a $5.6 million increase in state franchise taxes, a $4.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $5.4 million increase in charges 36 Table of Contents related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These increases were offset in part by the impact of a $19.0 million investor settlement in the prior year. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income increased 26% to $9.2 million driven by higher average interest rates, offset in part by a $0.9 million decrease due to lower average investment balances. Interest expense decreased 27% to $92.2 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009 and the repayment of the $550 million outstanding term loan balance in January 2010, which reduced interest expense by $14.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms. Fund support gains were $23.2 million in the prior year. The gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $27.3 million, primarily as a result of a $46.7 million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and a $4.3 million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of our Equity Units in the prior year. Other non operating income (expense) of CIVs decreased $15.6 million, to a gain of $1.7 million, due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a CIV. Income Tax Provision The provision for income taxes was $119.4 million compared to $118.7 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2011, the U.K. Finance Bill of 2010 was enacted, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 27% for periods beginning after April 1, 2011. The impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million. The effective tax rate was 32.7% compared to 36.0% in the prior year. The effective tax rate, excluding the impact of CIVs, was 32.0% and 36.7% as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the U.K. tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes. In addition, the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions. Although not yet enacted, additional proposed reductions in the U.K. corporate tax rate to 26% in fiscal 2012 and 25% in fiscal 2013 are expected. Each one percentage point reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate will result in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million at the time of enactment, based on the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2011, that have to be revalued at the new rate. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of a new financial accounting standard on consolidation, we now consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a CLO. In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles," we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs. We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the CIVs from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees earned by Legg Mason from CIVs are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs are removed from the GAAP basis Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to us. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding 37 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non GAAP basis of other companies. The following tables present a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs Total operating revenues $ 2,784,317 $ 4,133 $ 2,788,450 $ 2,634,879 $ 2,779 $ 2,637,658 Total operating expenses 2,397,509 (571 ) 2,396,938 2,313,696 680 2,314,376 Operating Income 386,808 4,704 391,512 321,183 2,099 323,282 Other non operating income (expense) (21,611 ) 3,680 (17,931 ) 8,473 (8,520 ) (47 ) Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 365,197 8,384 373,581 329,656 (6,421 ) 323,235 Income tax provision 119,434 119,434 118,676 118,676 Net Income (Loss) 245,763 8,384 254,147 210,980 (6,421 ) 204,559 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (8,160 ) 8,384 224 6,623 (6,421 ) 202 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 253,923 $ $ 253,923 $ 204,357 $ $ 204,357 Adjusted Income As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "Adjusted Income" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We define "Adjusted Income" as Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as impairment charges and the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, and net money market fund support losses (gains). We believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, is most readily reconcilable to Net Income determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income, but is not a substitute for Net Income and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider Adjusted Income 38 Table of Contents to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, issued contingent convertible debt, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. In calculating Adjusted Income we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carryforward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and U.K. tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle ("SIV") securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures. Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 39 Table of Contents A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 253,923 $ 204,357 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,913 22,769 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 134,602 136,252 U.K. tax rate adjustment (8,878 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 36,688 34,445 Net money market fund support gains(1) (16,565 ) Adjusted Income $ 439,248 $ 381,258 Net Income per diluted share Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.63 $ 1.32 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.15 0.14 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.87 0.88 U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.06 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.24 0.22 Net money market fund support gains(1) (0.11 ) Adjusted Income per diluted share $ 2.83 $ 2.45 (1)Net of income taxes. Operating Margin, as Adjusted We calculate "Operating Margin, as Adjusted," by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of CIVs, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues." The compensation items, other than transition related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income. Transition related costs and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Adjusted operating revenues also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP. We believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a 40 Table of Contents substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. The calculation of operating margin and operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,784,317 $ 2,634,879 Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 4,133 2,779 Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (712,779 ) (691,868 ) Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 2,075,671 $ 1,945,790 Operating Income $ 386,808 $ 321,183 Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 36,274 79,316 Transition related costs 54,434 Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 4,704 2,099 Operating Income, as Adjusted $ 482,220 $ 402,598 Operating margin, GAAP basis 13.9 % 12.2 % Operating margin, as adjusted 23.2 20.7 41  Table of Contents FISCAL 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2009 Financial Overview Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2010 totaled $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to Net loss attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $1.97 billion, or $13.99 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.4 billion of losses, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, related to the elimination of the exposure to SIVs in liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary in the prior fiscal year. The impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $863.4 million, net of income tax benefits, recorded in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the increase. Adjusted income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted loss of $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.7 billion of net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin increased to 12.2% from (19.9)% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to 20.7% from 23.9% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 2009 Beginning of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 38.8 43.7 Redemptions (40.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (76.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (82.0 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other(2) 134.1 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) End of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2010 were $685 billion, an increase of $52 billion or 8% from March 31, 2009. The increase in AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $134 billion, of which approximately 6% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, which was partially offset by net client outflows of $82 billion. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $64 billion, or 78% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $15 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset and Brandywine that had experienced past investment underperformance, although their performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge, Batterymarch, Permal and LMCM. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Equity $ 173.8 25.4 $ 126.9 20.1 37.0 Fixed income 364.3 53.2 357.6 56.5 1.9 Liquidity 146.4 21.4 147.9 23.4 (1.0 ) Total $ 684.5 100.0 $ 632.4 100.0 8.2 42 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2009 $ 126.9 $ 357.6 $ 147.9 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 18.7 20.1 38.8 Redemptions (23.4 ) (16.8 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (10.7 ) (67.3 ) 1.5 (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (15.4 ) (64.0 ) (2.6 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other 62.3 70.7 1.1 134.1 March 31, 2010 $ 173.8 $ 364.3 $ 146.4 $ 684.5 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Equity $ 155.7 23.0 $ 203.2 25.1 (23.4 ) Fixed income 370.7 54.9 438.0 54.0 (15.4 ) Liquidity 149.1 22.1 169.2 20.9 (11.9 ) Total $ 675.5 100.0 $ 810.4 100.0 (16.6 ) AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 475.8 69.5 $ 446.7 70.6 6.5 International 208.7 30.5 185.7 29.4 12.4 Total $ 684.5 100.0 $ 632.4 100.0 8.2 The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2010 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2009 $ 446.7 $ 185.7 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 24.4 14.4 38.8 Redemptions (26.2 ) (14.0 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (50.7 ) (25.8 ) (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (18.6 ) 14.5 (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (71.1 ) (10.9 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other 100.2 33.9 134.1 March 31, 2010 $ 475.8 $ 208.7 $ 684.5 43 Table of Contents Investment Performance(1) Investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2010 improved compared to relevant benchmarks from the prior year. Although the unemployment rate remains high, the U.S. economy continued to slowly show signs of recovery. A strong rebound in corporate earnings, improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending, and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence. However, uncertainty in the markets remained, as best evidenced by the May 6, 2010 intraday sell off and subsequent rebound. With concerns regarding the credit quality of certain European nations, and as government stimulus initiatives continued globally, debates about inflation and deflation loomed. In the fixed income markets, government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk. Most sector spreads declined in 2009 as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities. Investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with 2000 basis points in excess returns over treasuries in 2009. For the 1 year period, the Treasury yield curve was historically steep as the Federal Reserve continued to keep federal funds at close to 0%. The worst performing fixed income sector was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond returning (3.70)%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds which returned 58.21% for 2009. The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Equity 49 % 61 % 72 % 86 % 49 % 53 % 58 % 88 % Fixed income 88 % 40 % 50 % 88 % 31 % 12 % 32 % 17 % The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Total long term 62 % 68 % 70 % 80 % 43 % 52 % 47 % 75 % Equity 51 % 63 % 65 % 78 % 47 % 60 % 49 % 76 % Fixed income 81 % 78 % 83 % 87 % 38 % 41 % 45 % 72 % Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,864.2 70.8 $ 2,290.5 68.2 (18.6 ) International 770.7 29.2 1,066.9 31.8 (27.8 ) Total $ 2,634.9 100.0 $ 3,357.4 100.0 (21.5 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset, LMCM, and ClearBridge, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at Permal. (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 85% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 82% and 84%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 44 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 were $2.6 billion, down 22% from $3.4 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 17% decrease in average AUM. The shift in the mix of average AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $202.4 million, or 20%, to $814.8 million. Of this decrease, $104.3 million was the result of lower average equity assets at ClearBridge, Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), LMCM and Brandywine, and $95.5 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $469.1 million, or 26%, to $1.4 billion. Of this decrease, $309.2 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at Permal, LMCM, and ClearBridge, $73.1 million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors, and $66.9 million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset. Performance fees increased 310%, or $54.0 million, to $71.5 million during fiscal 2010, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset and Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 21% to $375.3 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund AUM and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses As a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal 2009 due to challenging market conditions, actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of promotional costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, with many of the more significant actions implemented in the December 2008 quarter. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2010, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 2% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was driven by a $139.1 million decrease in revenue share based compensation, primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal 2010, the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates. The net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately $27.5 million. These reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $150.3 million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by gains in other non operating income (expense). Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.2% from 33.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 29% to $691.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 13% to $163.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a $13.6 million reduction in technology consulting fees, telecommunications and market data services. Reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense, which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2010, of $7.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, also contributed to the decrease. Occupancy expense decreased 25% to $157.0 million, primarily due to the recognition of $70.1 million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year, offset in part by a $19.3 million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 38% to $22.8 million, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2009, which reduced amortization expense by $13.5 million. 45 Table of Contents Impairment charges were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and projected cash flows within that division. The remaining $146 million related to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and the impairment of a trade name. Other expenses decreased $14.4 million to $167.6 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of $15.6 million, and advertising costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.5 million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 87% to $7.4 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances, which reduced interest income by $36.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Interest expense decreased 31% to $126.3 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009, which reduced interest expense by $36.5 million, and a $24.6 million decrease due to the repayment of $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in March 2009, the repayment of our 6.75% senior notes in July 2008, the repayment of the $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million term loan in January 2010, as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal 2010. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily related to the early repayment of our $700 million term loan. Due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds, in fiscal 2010 we reversed unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 of $20.6 million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve SIVs. During fiscal 2009, fund support losses were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fund support. Other non operating income (expense) increased $203.9 million to income of $86.9 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.7 million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above, and $86.9 million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products, which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our Equity Units in fiscal 2010. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) The provision for income taxes was $118.7 million compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 36.0% compared to a benefit rate of 38.4% in the prior year. The current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The prior years benefit rate was driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge, offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary. 46 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles The following tables present a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs Total operating revenues $ 2,634,879 $ 2,779 $ 2,637,658 $ 3,357,367 $ 1,232 $ 3,358,599 Total operating expenses 2,313,696 680 2,314,376 4,026,547 (705 ) 4,025,842 Operating Income 321,183 2,099 323,282 (669,180 ) 1,937 (667,243 ) Other non operating income (expense) 8,473 (8,520 ) (47 ) (2,519,017 ) (4,705 ) (2,523,722 ) Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 329,656 (6,421 ) 323,235 (3,188,197 ) (2,768 ) (3,190,965 ) Income tax provision 118,676 118,676 (1,223,203 ) (1,223,203 ) Net Income (Loss) 210,980 (6,421 ) 204,559 (1,964,994 ) (2,768 ) (1,967,762 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 6,623 (6,421 ) 202 2,924 (2,768 ) 156 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) $ $ (1,967,918 ) 47 Table of Contents Adjusted Income A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,769 36,488 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 136,252 142,494 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 34,445 32,340 Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (16,565 ) 1,376,579 Impairment charges 1,307,970 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Adjusted Income $ 381,258 $ (1,191,389 ) Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.32 $ (13.99 ) Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.26 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.88 1.01 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.22 0.23 Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (0.11 ) 9.79 Impairment charges 9.30 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Adjusted income per diluted share $ 2.45 $ (8.47 ) (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit).

Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. The consolidation of variable interest entities as of April 1, 2010 under new accounting guidance, as further discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, did not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs, beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of operations. At March 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.4 billion, $8.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. Total assets and total liabilities of the CIVs at March 31, 2011 were $437 million and $337 million, respectively. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities $ 412.1 $ 1,413.1 $ 382.0 Cash flows used for investing activities (44.4 ) (276.7 ) (1,090.9 ) Cash flows (used for) from financing activities (468.5 ) (746.7 ) 329.2 Effect of exchange rate changes 10.8 19.5 (27.2 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (90.0 ) 409.2 (406.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,465.9 1,056.7 1,463.6 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,375.9 $ 1,465.9 $ 1,056.7 During fiscal 2011, our cash flows from operating activities were $412.1 million, primarily attributable to our current year net income adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2011 were $44.4 million, primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows for financing activities of $468.5 million, were driven by the repurchase of 14.6 million of our common shares for $445 million. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2010, cash flows from operating activities were $1,413.1 million, of which $1.0 billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks. The remainder was attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements. Cash outflows for financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million five year term loan, $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the Equity Units exchange offer and the payment of cash dividends. During fiscal 2009, cash flows from operations were $382.0 million, primarily attributable to revenue declines. Cash outflows for investing activities were $1.1 billion during fiscal 2009, primarily attributable to the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds, which used $2.9 billion. These outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and SIV securities of $1.1 billion, cash proceeds received for the sale of the implementation and overlay business of Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") of $181 million, and the return of a portion of a contingent earn out payment from the acquisition of PCM of $120 million that was previously funded into escrow. Cash flows from financing activities provided $329.2 million during fiscal 2009, primarily due to $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the offering of Equity Units, offset in part by the repayment of $425 million of 6.75% senior notes and a $250 million repayment on our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2011: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Total at March 31, 2011 Type 2011 2010 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,087,932 $ 1,051,243 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 103,039 103,039 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013 50 Table of Contents During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2011 and 2010 of approximately $36.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% Senior Notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. Approximately 2.1 million Equity Units with $103 million of 5.6% Senior Notes remain outstanding. We are in the process of evaluating our options for remarketing the Senior Notes by June 30, 2011. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. The facility was scheduled to mature on October 14, 2010; however, in fiscal 2010, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to February 11, 2013 and modify covenants, as discussed below. In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. In order to complete the May 2008 issuance of the Equity Units, we received a waiver of the covenant under which we are prevented from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. Upon expiration of this waiver on June 30, 2011, we will be unable to incur any additional debt if our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. As of March 31, 2011, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6 and thus the only new debt we could have incurred would be allowed by the covenant exceptions. At March 31, 2011, our financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $375 million. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, and any non cash charges, as defined. As of March 31, 2011, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 12.9. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2011. If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, 51 Table of Contents we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade by both rating agencies, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase. Other Transactions During fiscal 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Permal, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010 and 2009, we paid an aggregate amount of $15.0 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill. During fiscal 2010, we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In May 2010, 1.1 million shares, representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2007, in connection with the acquisition of PCM, we paid into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. Certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain affiliates are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009, we had arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our affiliates, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2010 all support arrangements were terminated or expired. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from certain liquidity funds that were previously supported under various capital support agreements ("CSAs") and letters of credit ("LOCs"). Upon the purchase of these securities, the CSAs and LOCs were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which included the return of $1.3 billion of collateral provided during fiscal 2009 to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by a total return swap ("TRS") and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were 52 Table of Contents terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder and $42 million of collateral was returned. Future Outlook We expect that over the next 12 months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. In addition to our ordinary operating cash needs, as described above, we anticipate other cash needs during the next 12 months. In connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model, we expect to incur transition related costs in the range of $115 million to $135 million through March 2012, of which approximately 15% are non cash charges. During fiscal 2011, $54.4 million of these costs were accrued and substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal 2012. A significant portion of the accrued costs will be paid in fiscal 2012. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 million to $150 million, excluding costs to achieve these savings, and expect to achieve these savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal 2011. We currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, as further discussed below, repayment of outstanding debt, payment of increased dividends, or acquisitions. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our iquidity needs. We also currently have approximately $1.0 billion in cash in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock by the end of fiscal 2012, subject to market conditions and our performance, actual cash flows, and other capital needs. These repurchases will be made under the current Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock, announced in May 2010, of which $555 million remains unused as of March 31, 2011. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events resulted in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. Credit and Liquidity Risk Cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 18 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 we had various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, all of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2010, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS. 53 Table of Contents In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Contingent Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity(2) 1.0 1.2 1.3 1,251.3 6.1 103.0 1,363.9 Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2)(3) 46.3 39.0 38.9 38.9 7.5 37.9 208.5 Minimum rental and service commitments 142.3 124.0 100.1 90.0 83.1 522.1 1,061.6 Total Contractual Obligations(4)(5)(6)(7) $ 439.6 $ 164.2 $ 140.3 $ 1,380.2 $ 96.7 $ 663.0 $ 2,884.0 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose. (2)Excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated CLO of $278.3 million and interest on these long term borrowings, as applicable. The amount in thereafter is contractually due fiscal 2022, subject to potential remarketing as further described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)Interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2011. (4)In connection with our restructuring plans, we no longer intend to exercise a put/purchase option on land and a building that was treated as a capital lease. The remaining rental commitment for this facility is included in minimum rental and service commitments above. (5)The table above does not include approximately $23.4 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal 2018. (6)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $60.2 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. (7)The table above does not include amounts related to our business streamlining initiatives. 54  Table of Contents MARKET RISK The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non Trading Assets Our trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. Trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2011 and 2010 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2011 2010 Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 120,107 $ 118,096 Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 204,063 142,497 Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 76,340 74,280 Total trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs $ 400,510 $ 334,873 Approximately $96.0 million and $149.8 million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading and other current investments of $72.6 million and $17.3 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. Approximately $231.9 million and $167.7 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $30.9 million and $33.0 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $39.8 and $19.3 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. 55 Table of Contents Non trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2011 and 2010 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2011 2010 Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Available for sale $ 11,300 $ 6,957 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 22,167 23,049 Equity method investments in partnerships, LLCs, and other 155,351 100,160 Other investments 270 1,452 Total non trading assets, excluding CIVs $ 189,088 $ 131,618 Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2011 and 2010 includes approximately $91.9 million and $55.7 million, respectively, of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program ("PPIP"). Investment securities of CIVs totaled $82.8 million and $37.2 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and investments of CIVs totaled $312.8 million and $13.7 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we held equity investments in the CIVs of $53.7 million and $61.9 million, respectively. Fluctuations in the market value of investments of CIVs in excess of our equity investment will not impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. However, it may have an impact on other non operating income (expense) of CIVs with a corresponding offset in net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." See Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives. The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2011: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase(1) Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease(1) Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments related to deferred compensation plans $ 120,107 $ 144,128 $ 96,086 Trading proprietary fund products and other 204,063 244,876 163,250 Equity method investments relating to deferred compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 76,340 91,608 61,072 Total current investments, excluding CIVs 400,510 480,612 320,408 Net investments in CIVs 53,708 64,450 42,966 Available for sale investments 11,300 13,560 9,040 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 22,167 26,600 17,734 Equity method investments in partnerships, LLCs, and other 155,351 186,421 124,281 Other investments 270 324 216 Total investments subject to market risk $ 643,306 $ 771,967 $ 514,645 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $39.8 million have been hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $70.3 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of March 31, 2011. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Australia, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $250.0 million and $253.6 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2011, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Consolidation Effective April 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, "Consolidation," (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R)") ("SFAS No. 167"), relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") which includes a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE, changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE, and changes in the assessment of which entities are VIEs. The application of the new accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds, including money market funds. Investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46(R)"). In the normal course of our business, we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles. Certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be VIEs while others are considered to be voting rights entities ("VREs") subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were not material at March 31, 2011. We have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these VIEs, VREs or their investors. Investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle. FIN 46(R) For sponsored investment funds, including money market funds, which qualify for the deferral of new accounting guidance, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker. It is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients which qualify for the deferral unless our ownership interest, including interests of related parties, is 57 Table of Contents substantial, unless we may earn significant performance fees from the VIE or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest in the VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE which qualifies for the deferral, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary. SFAS No. 167 We sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities ("CDOs") and CLOs that do not qualify for the deferral, and are assessed under the new accounting guidance, as follows. We determine whether we have a variable interest in a VIE by considering if, among other things, we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that are expected to be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return. If we have a significant variable interest, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is insignificant. Under both the new accounting guidance and prior guidance, Legg Mason must consolidate VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the 58 Table of Contents last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2011, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $189.6 billion, $356.6 billion, and $131.4 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2011, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except Legg Masons long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investees net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non operating income (expense). For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. In fiscal 2009, we had in place various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments were based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively 59 Table of Contents eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which supported investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding. During fiscal 2010, these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of $20.6 million were recovered. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010 and 2009. For investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, excluding investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $23.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, we also have approximately $177.5 million and $123.2 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $155.4 million and $100.2 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is accounted for under the cost method. In addition, as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $76.3 million and $74.3 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. This category also includes CLO loans and liabilities of a CIV. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. Previously, this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by SIVs. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and CLO debt of a CIV. The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at NAV determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market 60 Table of Contents prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. The fair values of CLO loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as Level 2. Legg Mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. The fair value of CLO debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the CLOs underlying collateral assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement, the CLO debt valuation is classified as Level 3. Exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale, the last offering price. Options traded over the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations. Options are classified as Level 1. Futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps are valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and are classified as Level 2. As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 3% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 10% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 2% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2011 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 48,692 $ 4,626 $ 53,318 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,601,551 1,152,106 3,753,657 Trade names 7,700 62,100 69,800 Goodwill 907,079 404,573 1,311,652 $ 3,565,022 $ 1,623,405 $ 5,188,427 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. 61  Table of Contents In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, internal budgets, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2010, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of December 31, 2010. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2011, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2011, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 7 years with a weighted average life of approximately 3.6 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names. We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the 62 Table of Contents carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2010 annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 8%. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 9%. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 13.2% and 14.5%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 20% and 25%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15.0% and 17.0%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $628 million and $321 million, respectively. Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Americas and International divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. 63 Table of Contents Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. For our December 31, 2010 annual impairment test, the projected cash flows were discounted at 13.2% and 14.0%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2010, the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 10%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 8%. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 8%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Cash flow growth for the Americas and International divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections were based on historical trends, in context with our long term growth experience, budgets, and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager, budgets, and market influences relevant to their business. Long term growth is based on our historical experience, available historic market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately 47% and 50%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 5.9 and 7.0 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. As of December 31, 2010, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team, which, among other things, will eliminate the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions into one Global Asset Management business during fiscal 2012. However, as of March 31, 2011, our internal management reporting has not changed. As a result, the Americas and International operating segments continued to be our reporting units. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 0.7 million, 1.5 million, and 1.5 million stock options in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date 64 Table of Contents of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2011, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $683 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.6 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $129 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to $3.1 million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance has been established with respect thereto. As of March 31, 2011, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $222 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $0.7 million for fiscal 2011. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. As of March 31, 2011, U.K. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, are not material. An additional valuation allowance was recorded on $3.0 million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions, principally relating to foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in equity. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in 65 Table of Contents revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, including expected earnings per share in future periods, anticipated future investment performance of our affiliates, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the mix of our AUM among our affiliates; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (5)Calculated based on total debt as a percentage of total capital (total stockholders equity plus total debt) as of March 31. 27  Table of Contents  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We currently operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, and manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. The Americas division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team which, among other things, will eliminate the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions into one Global Asset Management business during fiscal 2012. We believe this new structure will allow us to function as a global organization with a single purpose and allow us to focus on future growth opportunities. As of March 31, 2011, there has been no change to the internal executive management reporting and we continued to operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, with two divisions, Americas and International. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. In addition, from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other 28 Table of Contents arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The economic downturn of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contributed to a significant contraction in our business. We have experienced improvement over the past two years, although we have not recovered to pre downturn levels. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States continued to rebound during fiscal 2011, but challenging conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding the strength of the economic recovery, continued concerns over budget deficits, and high levels of unemployment. The impact of the earthquake that occurred in Japan in March 2011, along with political unrest in the Middle East, have created new uncertainties. In spite of these global concerns, the markets continued to increase due to steady improvement in consumer confidence, stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates, and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors. During fiscal 2011, the Federal Reserve Board held the discount rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2012. All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below: % Change for the year ended March 31, Indices(1) 2011 2010 Dow Jones Industrial Average 13.48 % 42.68 % S&P 500 13.37 % 46.57 % NASDAQ Composite Index 15.98 % 56.87 % Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 5.12 % 7.69 % Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index 7.15 % 10.23 % (1)Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. 29 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change(1) 2011 Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 29.3 % 30.9 % 30.3 % 0.1 % (19.9 )% Funds 53.4 51.9 54.7 8.7 (25.5 ) Performance fees 3.5 2.7 0.5 35.3 310.0 Distribution and service fees 13.6 14.3 14.2 1.0 (21.0 ) Other 0.2 0.2 0.3 4.6 (47.6 ) Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 5.7 (21.5 ) Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 41.0 42.2 33.7 2.6 (1.8 ) Transition related compensation 1.6 n/m n/m Total compensation and benefits 42.6 42.2 33.7 6.7 (1.8 ) Distribution and servicing 25.6 26.3 28.9 3.0 (28.7 ) Communications and technology 5.8 6.2 5.6 (0.7 ) (13.4 ) Occupancy 5.0 6.0 6.2 (12.2 ) (25.1 ) Amortization of intangible assets 0.8 0.8 1.1 0.6 (37.6 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 39.0 n/m n/m Other 6.3 6.3 5.4 5.3 (7.9 ) Total operating expenses 86.1 87.8 119.9 3.6 (42.5 ) Operating Income (Loss) 13.9 12.2 (19.9 ) 20.4 n/m Other Income (Expense) Interest income 0.3 0.3 1.7 25.7 (86.9 ) Interest expense (3.3 ) (4.8 ) (5.5 ) (27.0 ) (30.9 ) Fund support 0.9 (68.0 ) n/m n/m Other 2.1 3.2 (3.5 ) (31.4 ) n/m Other non operating income (expense) of consolidated investment vehicles 0.1 0.7 0.2 (90.2 ) n/m Total other income (expense) (0.8 ) 0.3 (75.1 ) n/m n/m Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 13.1 12.5 (95.0 ) 10.8 n/m Income tax provision (benefit) 4.3 4.5 (36.5 ) 0.6 n/m Net Income (Loss) 8.8 8.0 (58.5 ) 16.5 n/m Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.3 ) 0.2 0.1 n/m n/m Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. 9.1 % 7.8 % (58.6 )% 24.3 n/m n/m not meaningful (1)Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 30 Table of Contents FISCAL 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2010 Financial Overview Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2011 totaled $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase in Net Income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues, reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees, reduced interest expense, and a change in the U.K. tax rate. These increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation, the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year, and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Net Income, as previously discussed, excluding the impact of the current year U.K. tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year. Operating margin increased to 13.9% from 12.2% in the prior year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) increased to 23.2% from 20.7% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 2010 Beginning of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 49.5 38.8 Redemptions (44.3 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (52.1 ) (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2 ) (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (61.1 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other(2) 56.3 134.1 Dispositions (2.1 ) End of period $ 677.6 $ 684.5 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2011 was $678 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 1% from March 31, 2010. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $61 billion, which were partially offset by market appreciation of $56 billion, of which approximately 17% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, and dispositions of $2 billion, relating to the sale of a Singapore based Asian equity manager. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $37 billion, or 61% of the outflows, followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of $16 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset"). We have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge") and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"), while The Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal") and Royce & Associates ("Royce) had net inflows. Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net annual equity outflows since fiscal 2007. However, the rate of outflows in this asset class was lower year over year. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney amended certain historical Smith Barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage, that resulted in a reduction of approximately $16 billion in liquidity AUM. We are currently waiving much of the management fees generated by these assets, so a loss of this AUM this year would have reduced net advisory revenue by only $8 million and not had a material impact on Net Income due to the impact of revenue sharing arrangements and income taxes. In addition, we expect further amendments to result in an additional $7 billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next 15 months. Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice.

The equity markets worked through a difficult year with more recent political upheaval in the Middle East driving a significant increase in oil prices and the earthquake in Japan and subsequent nuclear crisis raising questions about the future of the nuclear power industry. Despite these global concerns, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our fourth fiscal quarter and our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions activity. In the fixed income markets, relatively strong economic data, combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise across the yield curve. The yield curve slightly flattened over the quarter and the year as the Federal Reserve kept its funds rate at 0.25% and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period. The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond Index returning 4.28%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Bond Index, which returned 14.31% followed by U.S. TIPS, as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which returned 7.91% for the year. The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Equity 42 % 57 % 61 % 77 % 49 % 61 % 72 % 86 % Fixed income 82 % 80 % 70 % 81 % 88 % 40 % 50 % 88 % (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, 89% and 87% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 89% and 82%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. 33 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category averages as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Total long term 56 % 74 % 70 % 67 % 62 % 68 % 70 % 80 % Equity 58 % 70 % 68 % 60 % 51 % 63 % 65 % 78 % Fixed income 52 % 83 % 78 % 85 % 81 % 78 % 83 % 87 % Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,917.9 68.9 $ 1,864.2 70.8 2.9 International 866.4 31.1 770.7 29.2 12.4 Total $ 2,784.3 100.0 $ 2,634.9 100.0 5.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Royce. The increase in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees and performance fees on assets managed by the international operations of Western Asset and increased fund revenues at Permal. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 34 Table of Contents Business Model Streamlining Initiative In May 2010, we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes: (i) transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships; and (ii) sharing in affiliate revenue with our Americas distribution group. We project that the initiative will result in $130 million to $150 million in expense reductions that will be fully realized on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These expense savings consist of (i) approximately $75 million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates, and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements; (ii) approximately $50 million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units, including savings associated with consolidating office space; and (iii) approximately $15 million from our Americas distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements. The initiative involves approximately $115 million to $135 million in transition related costs that primarily include charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period. The transition related costs will also include charges for consolidating leased office space, early contract terminations, asset disposals and professional fees. During fiscal 2011, transition related costs totaled $54.4 million, which, net of related cost savings, reduced our operating income by $42 million. Substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal 2012. The nature and amount of transition costs and savings are based on estimates. While management expects the total costs and savings to be within the ranges disclosed, actual results may differ in amount and nature from these estimates. The achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements, as well as the amount and nature of transition related costs, will be subject to many factors, including market conditions and other factors affecting our financial results, and those of our affiliates, and the rate of AUM growth. In addition, our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support our business. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of a new accounting standard on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity ("CLO"). The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non operating income (expense), is reflected in our Net Income, net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the consolidation of investment vehicles is presented in our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles" (See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information). Also, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles. Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2011 were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from $2.6 billion in the prior year, despite a 1% decrease in average AUM, reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees. These increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at $815.6 million, as a decrease of $25.4 million, resulting from lower average fixed income assets at Western Asset, was offset by an $18.6 million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. ("Batterymarch") and Royce, a $5.1 million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine Global Management, LLC ("Brandywine"), and a $2.2 million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain CLOs managed by Western Asset. Investment advisory fees from funds increased $119.3 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion. Of this increase, $111.5 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at Royce, Permal, and ClearBridge, and 35 Table of Contents $84.4 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset and a $36.0 million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset, primarily to maintain certain yields to investors. Performance fees increased 35%, or $25.2 million, to $96.7 million during fiscal 2011, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine. Distribution and service fees increased 1% to $379.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses Total compensation and benefits increased $74.1 million to $1.2 billion. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation of $45.0 million, which represents severance and retention incentive costs, increased $29.0 million, or 3%, to $1.14 billion. This increase was driven by a $68.6 million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal 2011 and a $7.5 million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are recorded in Other non operating income (expense), as well as, a $6.1 million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates. The impact of reduced headcount, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives, also reduced compensation and benefits by $6.0 million. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.6% from 42.2% in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation, and transition related compensation. These increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues. We have an arrangement with an affiliate under which the affiliates incentive compensation pool under a revenue sharing agreement has been reduced over the last two years to reimburse the parent company for certain expenses, while at the same time the parent company has provided an equivalent amount of deferred compensation to the affiliates employees. A portion of the deferred compensation was granted in the form of restricted stock awards and the remainder in cash awards granted under a non qualified plan, both of which will vest over periods of three to four years. The amount by which the affiliates incentive compensation will be reduced in fiscal 2012 under the arrangement will be significantly less than the reduction in fiscal 2011. In addition, there will be an increase in the amount of non cash amortization expense associated with the vesting of the deferred compensation awards from prior years. The combined impact will result in a $74 million increase in compensation and benefits in fiscal 2012, which will be recognized ratably over the year. This arrangement will continue for the subsequent five years, however, the incremental effect on compensation expense from year to year will be far less significant. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 3% to $712.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of $14.5 million in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 1% to $162.0 million, of which $9.2 million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during the current year, offset in part by a $6.6 million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives. Occupancy expense decreased 12% to $137.9 million, primarily due to the impact of a $19.3 million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at $22.9 million. Other expenses increased $8.9 million to $176.6 million, primarily as a result of a $10.3 million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs, a $5.6 million increase in state franchise taxes, a $4.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $5.4 million increase in charges 36 Table of Contents related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These increases were offset in part by the impact of a $19.0 million investor settlement in the prior year. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income increased 26% to $9.2 million driven by higher average interest rates, offset in part by a $0.9 million decrease due to lower average investment balances. Interest expense decreased 27% to $92.2 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009 and the repayment of the $550 million outstanding term loan balance in January 2010, which reduced interest expense by $14.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms. Fund support gains were $23.2 million in the prior year. The gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $27.3 million, primarily as a result of a $46.7 million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and a $4.3 million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of our Equity Units in the prior year. Other non operating income (expense) of CIVs decreased $15.6 million, to a gain of $1.7 million, due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a CIV. Income Tax Provision The provision for income taxes was $119.4 million compared to $118.7 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2011, the U.K. Finance Bill of 2010 was enacted, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 27% for periods beginning after April 1, 2011. The impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million. The effective tax rate was 32.7% compared to 36.0% in the prior year. The effective tax rate, excluding the impact of CIVs, was 32.0% and 36.7% as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the U.K. tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes. In addition, the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions. Although not yet enacted, additional proposed reductions in the U.K. corporate tax rate to 26% in fiscal 2012 and 25% in fiscal 2013 are expected. Each one percentage point reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate will result in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million at the time of enactment, based on the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2011, that have to be revalued at the new rate. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of a new financial accounting standard on consolidation, we now consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a CLO. In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles," we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs. We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the CIVs from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees earned by Legg Mason from CIVs are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs are removed from the GAAP basis Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to us. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding 37 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non GAAP basis of other companies. The following tables present a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs Total operating revenues $ 2,784,317 $ 4,133 $ 2,788,450 $ 2,634,879 $ 2,779 $ 2,637,658 Total operating expenses 2,397,509 (571 ) 2,396,938 2,313,696 680 2,314,376 Operating Income 386,808 4,704 391,512 321,183 2,099 323,282 Other non operating income (expense) (21,611 ) 3,680 (17,931 ) 8,473 (8,520 ) (47 ) Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 365,197 8,384 373,581 329,656 (6,421 ) 323,235 Income tax provision 119,434 119,434 118,676 118,676 Net Income (Loss) 245,763 8,384 254,147 210,980 (6,421 ) 204,559 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (8,160 ) 8,384 224 6,623 (6,421 ) 202 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 253,923 $ $ 253,923 $ 204,357 $ $ 204,357 Adjusted Income As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "Adjusted Income" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We define "Adjusted Income" as Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as impairment charges and the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, and net money market fund support losses (gains). We believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, is most readily reconcilable to Net Income determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income, but is not a substitute for Net Income and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider Adjusted Income 38 Table of Contents to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, issued contingent convertible debt, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. In calculating Adjusted Income we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carryforward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and U.K. tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle ("SIV") securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures. Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 39 Table of Contents A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 253,923 $ 204,357 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,913 22,769 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 134,602 136,252 U.K. tax rate adjustment (8,878 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 36,688 34,445 Net money market fund support gains(1) (16,565 ) Adjusted Income $ 439,248 $ 381,258 Net Income per diluted share Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.63 $ 1.32 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.15 0.14 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.87 0.88 U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.06 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.24 0.22 Net money market fund support gains(1) (0.11 ) Adjusted Income per diluted share $ 2.83 $ 2.45 (1)Net of income taxes. Operating Margin, as Adjusted We calculate "Operating Margin, as Adjusted," by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of CIVs, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues." The compensation items, other than transition related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income. Transition related costs and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Adjusted operating revenues also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP. We believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a 40 Table of Contents substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. The calculation of operating margin and operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,784,317 $ 2,634,879 Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 4,133 2,779 Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (712,779 ) (691,868 ) Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 2,075,671 $ 1,945,790 Operating Income $ 386,808 $ 321,183 Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 36,274 79,316 Transition related costs 54,434 Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 4,704 2,099 Operating Income, as Adjusted $ 482,220 $ 402,598 Operating margin, GAAP basis 13.9 % 12.2 % Operating margin, as adjusted 23.2 20.7 41  Table of Contents FISCAL 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2009 Financial Overview Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2010 totaled $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to Net loss attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $1.97 billion, or $13.99 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.4 billion of losses, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, related to the elimination of the exposure to SIVs in liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary in the prior fiscal year. The impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $863.4 million, net of income tax benefits, recorded in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the increase. Adjusted income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted loss of $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.7 billion of net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin increased to 12.2% from (19.9)% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to 20.7% from 23.9% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 2009 Beginning of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 38.8 43.7 Redemptions (40.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (76.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (82.0 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other(2) 134.1 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) End of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2010 were $685 billion, an increase of $52 billion or 8% from March 31, 2009. The increase in AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $134 billion, of which approximately 6% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, which was partially offset by net client outflows of $82 billion. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $64 billion, or 78% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $15 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset and Brandywine that had experienced past investment underperformance, although their performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge, Batterymarch, Permal and LMCM.

Although the unemployment rate remains high, the U.S. economy continued to slowly show signs of recovery. A strong rebound in corporate earnings, improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending, and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence. However, uncertainty in the markets remained, as best evidenced by the May 6, 2010 intraday sell off and subsequent rebound. With concerns regarding the credit quality of certain European nations, and as government stimulus initiatives continued globally, debates about inflation and deflation loomed. In the fixed income markets, government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk. Most sector spreads declined in 2009 as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities. Investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with 2000 basis points in excess returns over treasuries in 2009. For the 1 year period, the Treasury yield curve was historically steep as the Federal Reserve continued to keep federal funds at close to 0%. The worst performing fixed income sector was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond returning (3.70)%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds which returned 58.21% for 2009. The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Equity 49 % 61 % 72 % 86 % 49 % 53 % 58 % 88 % Fixed income 88 % 40 % 50 % 88 % 31 % 12 % 32 % 17 % The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Total long term 62 % 68 % 70 % 80 % 43 % 52 % 47 % 75 % Equity 51 % 63 % 65 % 78 % 47 % 60 % 49 % 76 % Fixed income 81 % 78 % 83 % 87 % 38 % 41 % 45 % 72 % Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,864.2 70.8 $ 2,290.5 68.2 (18.6 ) International 770.7 29.2 1,066.9 31.8 (27.8 ) Total $ 2,634.9 100.0 $ 3,357.4 100.0 (21.5 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset, LMCM, and ClearBridge, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at Permal. (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 85% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 82% and 84%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 44 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 were $2.6 billion, down 22% from $3.4 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 17% decrease in average AUM. The shift in the mix of average AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $202.4 million, or 20%, to $814.8 million. Of this decrease, $104.3 million was the result of lower average equity assets at ClearBridge, Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), LMCM and Brandywine, and $95.5 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $469.1 million, or 26%, to $1.4 billion. Of this decrease, $309.2 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at Permal, LMCM, and ClearBridge, $73.1 million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors, and $66.9 million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset. Performance fees increased 310%, or $54.0 million, to $71.5 million during fiscal 2010, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset and Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 21% to $375.3 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund AUM and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses As a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal 2009 due to challenging market conditions, actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of promotional costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, with many of the more significant actions implemented in the December 2008 quarter. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2010, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 2% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was driven by a $139.1 million decrease in revenue share based compensation, primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal 2010, the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates. The net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately $27.5 million. These reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $150.3 million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by gains in other non operating income (expense). Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.2% from 33.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 29% to $691.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 13% to $163.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a $13.6 million reduction in technology consulting fees, telecommunications and market data services. Reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense, which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2010, of $7.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, also contributed to the decrease. Occupancy expense decreased 25% to $157.0 million, primarily due to the recognition of $70.1 million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year, offset in part by a $19.3 million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 38% to $22.8 million, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2009, which reduced amortization expense by $13.5 million. 45 Table of Contents Impairment charges were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and projected cash flows within that division. The remaining $146 million related to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and the impairment of a trade name. Other expenses decreased $14.4 million to $167.6 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of $15.6 million, and advertising costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.5 million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 87% to $7.4 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances, which reduced interest income by $36.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Interest expense decreased 31% to $126.3 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009, which reduced interest expense by $36.5 million, and a $24.6 million decrease due to the repayment of $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in March 2009, the repayment of our 6.75% senior notes in July 2008, the repayment of the $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million term loan in January 2010, as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal 2010. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily related to the early repayment of our $700 million term loan. Due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds, in fiscal 2010 we reversed unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 of $20.6 million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve SIVs. During fiscal 2009, fund support losses were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fund support. Other non operating income (expense) increased $203.9 million to income of $86.9 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.7 million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above, and $86.9 million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products, which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our Equity Units in fiscal 2010. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) The provision for income taxes was $118.7 million compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 36.0% compared to a benefit rate of 38.4% in the prior year. The current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The prior years benefit rate was driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge, offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary. 46 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles The following tables present a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs Total operating revenues $ 2,634,879 $ 2,779 $ 2,637,658 $ 3,357,367 $ 1,232 $ 3,358,599 Total operating expenses 2,313,696 680 2,314,376 4,026,547 (705 ) 4,025,842 Operating Income 321,183 2,099 323,282 (669,180 ) 1,937 (667,243 ) Other non operating income (expense) 8,473 (8,520 ) (47 ) (2,519,017 ) (4,705 ) (2,523,722 ) Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 329,656 (6,421 ) 323,235 (3,188,197 ) (2,768 ) (3,190,965 ) Income tax provision 118,676 118,676 (1,223,203 ) (1,223,203 ) Net Income (Loss) 210,980 (6,421 ) 204,559 (1,964,994 ) (2,768 ) (1,967,762 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 6,623 (6,421 ) 202 2,924 (2,768 ) 156 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) $ $ (1,967,918 ) 47 Table of Contents Adjusted Income A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,769 36,488 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 136,252 142,494 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 34,445 32,340 Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (16,565 ) 1,376,579 Impairment charges 1,307,970 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Adjusted Income $ 381,258 $ (1,191,389 ) Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.32 $ (13.99 ) Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.26 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.88 1.01 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.22 0.23 Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (0.11 ) 9.79 Impairment charges 9.30 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Adjusted income per diluted share $ 2.45 $ (8.47 ) (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit).

Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. The consolidation of variable interest entities as of April 1, 2010 under new accounting guidance, as further discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, did not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs, beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of operations. At March 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.4 billion, $8.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. Total assets and total liabilities of the CIVs at March 31, 2011 were $437 million and $337 million, respectively. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities $ 412.1 $ 1,413.1 $ 382.0 Cash flows used for investing activities (44.4 ) (276.7 ) (1,090.9 ) Cash flows (used for) from financing activities (468.5 ) (746.7 ) 329.2 Effect of exchange rate changes 10.8 19.5 (27.2 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (90.0 ) 409.2 (406.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,465.9 1,056.7 1,463.6 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,375.9 $ 1,465.9 $ 1,056.7 During fiscal 2011, our cash flows from operating activities were $412.1 million, primarily attributable to our current year net income adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2011 were $44.4 million, primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows for financing activities of $468.5 million, were driven by the repurchase of 14.6 million of our common shares for $445 million. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2010, cash flows from operating activities were $1,413.1 million, of which $1.0 billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks. The remainder was attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements. Cash outflows for financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million five year term loan, $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the Equity Units exchange offer and the payment of cash dividends. During fiscal 2009, cash flows from operations were $382.0 million, primarily attributable to revenue declines. Cash outflows for investing activities were $1.1 billion during fiscal 2009, primarily attributable to the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds, which used $2.9 billion. These outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and SIV securities of $1.1 billion, cash proceeds received for the sale of the implementation and overlay business of Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") of $181 million, and the return of a portion of a contingent earn out payment from the acquisition of PCM of $120 million that was previously funded into escrow. Cash flows from financing activities provided $329.2 million during fiscal 2009, primarily due to $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the offering of Equity Units, offset in part by the repayment of $425 million of 6.75% senior notes and a $250 million repayment on our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2011: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Total at March 31, 2011 Type 2011 2010 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,087,932 $ 1,051,243 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 103,039 103,039 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013 50 Table of Contents During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2011 and 2010 of approximately $36.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% Senior Notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. Approximately 2.1 million Equity Units with $103 million of 5.6% Senior Notes remain outstanding. We are in the process of evaluating our options for remarketing the Senior Notes by June 30, 2011. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. The facility was scheduled to mature on October 14, 2010; however, in fiscal 2010, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to February 11, 2013 and modify covenants, as discussed below. In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. In order to complete the May 2008 issuance of the Equity Units, we received a waiver of the covenant under which we are prevented from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. Upon expiration of this waiver on June 30, 2011, we will be unable to incur any additional debt if our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. As of March 31, 2011, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6 and thus the only new debt we could have incurred would be allowed by the covenant exceptions. At March 31, 2011, our financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $375 million. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, and any non cash charges, as defined. As of March 31, 2011, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 12.9. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2011. If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, 51 Table of Contents we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade by both rating agencies, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase. Other Transactions During fiscal 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Permal, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010 and 2009, we paid an aggregate amount of $15.0 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill. During fiscal 2010, we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In May 2010, 1.1 million shares, representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2007, in connection with the acquisition of PCM, we paid into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. Certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain affiliates are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009, we had arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our affiliates, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2010 all support arrangements were terminated or expired. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from certain liquidity funds that were previously supported under various capital support agreements ("CSAs") and letters of credit ("LOCs"). Upon the purchase of these securities, the CSAs and LOCs were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which included the return of $1.3 billion of collateral provided during fiscal 2009 to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by a total return swap ("TRS") and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were 52 Table of Contents terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder and $42 million of collateral was returned. Future Outlook We expect that over the next 12 months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. In addition to our ordinary operating cash needs, as described above, we anticipate other cash needs during the next 12 months. In connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model, we expect to incur transition related costs in the range of $115 million to $135 million through March 2012, of which approximately 15% are non cash charges. During fiscal 2011, $54.4 million of these costs were accrued and substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal 2012. A significant portion of the accrued costs will be paid in fiscal 2012. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 million to $150 million, excluding costs to achieve these savings, and expect to achieve these savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal 2011. We currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, as further discussed below, repayment of outstanding debt, payment of increased dividends, or acquisitions. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our iquidity needs. We also currently have approximately $1.0 billion in cash in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock by the end of fiscal 2012, subject to market conditions and our performance, actual cash flows, and other capital needs. These repurchases will be made under the current Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock, announced in May 2010, of which $555 million remains unused as of March 31, 2011. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events resulted in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. Credit and Liquidity Risk Cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 18 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 we had various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, all of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2010, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS. 53 Table of Contents In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Contingent Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity(2) 1.0 1.2 1.3 1,251.3 6.1 103.0 1,363.9 Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2)(3) 46.3 39.0 38.9 38.9 7.5 37.9 208.5 Minimum rental and service commitments 142.3 124.0 100.1 90.0 83.1 522.1 1,061.6 Total Contractual Obligations(4)(5)(6)(7) $ 439.6 $ 164.2 $ 140.3 $ 1,380.2 $ 96.7 $ 663.0 $ 2,884.0 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose. (2)Excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated CLO of $278.3 million and interest on these long term borrowings, as applicable. The amount in thereafter is contractually due fiscal 2022, subject to potential remarketing as further described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)Interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2011. (4)In connection with our restructuring plans, we no longer intend to exercise a put/purchase option on land and a building that was treated as a capital lease. The remaining rental commitment for this facility is included in minimum rental and service commitments above. (5)The table above does not include approximately $23.4 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal 2018. (6)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $60.2 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. (7)The table above does not include amounts related to our business streamlining initiatives. 54  Table of Contents MARKET RISK The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non Trading Assets Our trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. Trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2011 and 2010 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2011 2010 Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 120,107 $ 118,096 Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 204,063 142,497 Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 76,340 74,280 Total trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs $ 400,510 $ 334,873 Approximately $96.0 million and $149.8 million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading and other current investments of $72.6 million and $17.3 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. Approximately $231.9 million and $167.7 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $30.9 million and $33.0 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $39.8 and $19.3 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. 55 Table of Contents Non trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2011 and 2010 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2011 2010 Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Available for sale $ 11,300 $ 6,957 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 22,167 23,049 Equity method investments in partnerships, LLCs, and other 155,351 100,160 Other investments 270 1,452 Total non trading assets, excluding CIVs $ 189,088 $ 131,618 Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2011 and 2010 includes approximately $91.9 million and $55.7 million, respectively, of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program ("PPIP"). Investment securities of CIVs totaled $82.8 million and $37.2 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and investments of CIVs totaled $312.8 million and $13.7 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we held equity investments in the CIVs of $53.7 million and $61.9 million, respectively. Fluctuations in the market value of investments of CIVs in excess of our equity investment will not impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. However, it may have an impact on other non operating income (expense) of CIVs with a corresponding offset in net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." See Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives. The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2011: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase(1) Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease(1) Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments related to deferred compensation plans $ 120,107 $ 144,128 $ 96,086 Trading proprietary fund products and other 204,063 244,876 163,250 Equity method investments relating to deferred compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 76,340 91,608 61,072 Total current investments, excluding CIVs 400,510 480,612 320,408 Net investments in CIVs 53,708 64,450 42,966 Available for sale investments 11,300 13,560 9,040 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 22,167 26,600 17,734 Equity method investments in partnerships, LLCs, and other 155,351 186,421 124,281 Other investments 270 324 216 Total investments subject to market risk $ 643,306 $ 771,967 $ 514,645 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $39.8 million have been hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $70.3 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of March 31, 2011. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Australia, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $250.0 million and $253.6 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2011, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Consolidation Effective April 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, "Consolidation," (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R)") ("SFAS No. 167"), relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") which includes a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE, changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE, and changes in the assessment of which entities are VIEs. The application of the new accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds, including money market funds. Investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46(R)"). In the normal course of our business, we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles. Certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be VIEs while others are considered to be voting rights entities ("VREs") subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were not material at March 31, 2011. We have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these VIEs, VREs or their investors. Investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle. FIN 46(R) For sponsored investment funds, including money market funds, which qualify for the deferral of new accounting guidance, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker. It is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients which qualify for the deferral unless our ownership interest, including interests of related parties, is 57 Table of Contents substantial, unless we may earn significant performance fees from the VIE or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest in the VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE which qualifies for the deferral, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary. SFAS No. 167 We sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities ("CDOs") and CLOs that do not qualify for the deferral, and are assessed under the new accounting guidance, as follows. We determine whether we have a variable interest in a VIE by considering if, among other things, we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that are expected to be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return. If we have a significant variable interest, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is insignificant. Under both the new accounting guidance and prior guidance, Legg Mason must consolidate VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the 58 Table of Contents last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2011, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $189.6 billion, $356.6 billion, and $131.4 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2011, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except Legg Masons long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investees net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non operating income (expense). For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. In fiscal 2009, we had in place various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments were based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively 59 Table of Contents eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which supported investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding. During fiscal 2010, these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of $20.6 million were recovered. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010 and 2009. For investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, excluding investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $23.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, we also have approximately $177.5 million and $123.2 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $155.4 million and $100.2 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is accounted for under the cost method. In addition, as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $76.3 million and $74.3 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. This category also includes CLO loans and liabilities of a CIV. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. Previously, this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by SIVs. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and CLO debt of a CIV. The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at NAV determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market 60 Table of Contents prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. The fair values of CLO loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as Level 2. Legg Mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. The fair value of CLO debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the CLOs underlying collateral assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement, the CLO debt valuation is classified as Level 3. Exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale, the last offering price. Options traded over the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations. Options are classified as Level 1. Futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps are valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and are classified as Level 2. As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 3% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 10% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 2% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2011 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 48,692 $ 4,626 $ 53,318 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,601,551 1,152,106 3,753,657 Trade names 7,700 62,100 69,800 Goodwill 907,079 404,573 1,311,652 $ 3,565,022 $ 1,623,405 $ 5,188,427 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. 61  Table of Contents In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, internal budgets, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2010, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of December 31, 2010. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2011, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2011, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 7 years with a weighted average life of approximately 3.6 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names. We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the 62 Table of Contents carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2010 annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 8%. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 9%. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 13.2% and 14.5%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 20% and 25%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15.0% and 17.0%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $628 million and $321 million, respectively. Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Americas and International divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. 63 Table of Contents Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. For our December 31, 2010 annual impairment test, the projected cash flows were discounted at 13.2% and 14.0%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2010, the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 10%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 8%. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 8%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Cash flow growth for the Americas and International divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections were based on historical trends, in context with our long term growth experience, budgets, and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager, budgets, and market influences relevant to their business. Long term growth is based on our historical experience, available historic market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately 47% and 50%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 5.9 and 7.0 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. As of December 31, 2010, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team, which, among other things, will eliminate the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions into one Global Asset Management business during fiscal 2012. However, as of March 31, 2011, our internal management reporting has not changed. As a result, the Americas and International operating segments continued to be our reporting units. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 0.7 million, 1.5 million, and 1.5 million stock options in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date 64 Table of Contents of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2011, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $683 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.6 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $129 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to $3.1 million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance has been established with respect thereto. As of March 31, 2011, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $222 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $0.7 million for fiscal 2011. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. As of March 31, 2011, U.K. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, are not material. An additional valuation allowance was recorded on $3.0 million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions, principally relating to foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in equity. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in 65 Table of Contents revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, including expected earnings per share in future periods, anticipated future investment performance of our affiliates, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the mix of our AUM among our affiliates; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values. See discussion of "Market Risks Revenues and Net Income" and "Critical Accounting Policies Intangible Assets and Goodwill" previously discussed.  ITEM 7A.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk" for disclosure about market risk. 66  Table of Contents  
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Legg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Taiwan. We currently operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, and manage our business in two divisions or operating segments, Americas and International, which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage. The Americas division consists of our U.S. domiciled fund families, the separate account businesses of our U.S. based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization. Similarly, the International Division consists of our fund complexes, distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the U.S. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team which, among other things, will eliminate the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions into one Global Asset Management business during fiscal 2012. We believe this new structure will allow us to function as a global organization with a single purpose and allow us to focus on future growth opportunities. As of March 31, 2011, there has been no change to the internal executive management reporting and we continued to operate in one reportable business segment, Asset Management, with two divisions, Americas and International. Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions. The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. In addition, from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other 28 Table of Contents arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability. The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity. Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our assets under management, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. The economic downturn of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contributed to a significant contraction in our business. We have experienced improvement over the past two years, although we have not recovered to pre downturn levels. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability. All references to fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial environment globally and in the United States continued to rebound during fiscal 2011, but challenging conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding the strength of the economic recovery, continued concerns over budget deficits, and high levels of unemployment. The impact of the earthquake that occurred in Japan in March 2011, along with political unrest in the Middle East, have created new uncertainties. In spite of these global concerns, the markets continued to increase due to steady improvement in consumer confidence, stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates, and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors. During fiscal 2011, the Federal Reserve Board held the discount rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. The financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal 2012. All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below: % Change for the year ended March 31, Indices(1) 2011 2010 Dow Jones Industrial Average 13.48 % 42.68 % S&P 500 13.37 % 46.57 % NASDAQ Composite Index 15.98 % 56.87 % Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 5.12 % 7.69 % Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index 7.15 % 10.23 % (1)Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. 29 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change(1) 2011 Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 29.3 % 30.9 % 30.3 % 0.1 % (19.9 )% Funds 53.4 51.9 54.7 8.7 (25.5 ) Performance fees 3.5 2.7 0.5 35.3 310.0 Distribution and service fees 13.6 14.3 14.2 1.0 (21.0 ) Other 0.2 0.2 0.3 4.6 (47.6 ) Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 5.7 (21.5 ) Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 41.0 42.2 33.7 2.6 (1.8 ) Transition related compensation 1.6 n/m n/m Total compensation and benefits 42.6 42.2 33.7 6.7 (1.8 ) Distribution and servicing 25.6 26.3 28.9 3.0 (28.7 ) Communications and technology 5.8 6.2 5.6 (0.7 ) (13.4 ) Occupancy 5.0 6.0 6.2 (12.2 ) (25.1 ) Amortization of intangible assets 0.8 0.8 1.1 0.6 (37.6 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 39.0 n/m n/m Other 6.3 6.3 5.4 5.3 (7.9 ) Total operating expenses 86.1 87.8 119.9 3.6 (42.5 ) Operating Income (Loss) 13.9 12.2 (19.9 ) 20.4 n/m Other Income (Expense) Interest income 0.3 0.3 1.7 25.7 (86.9 ) Interest expense (3.3 ) (4.8 ) (5.5 ) (27.0 ) (30.9 ) Fund support 0.9 (68.0 ) n/m n/m Other 2.1 3.2 (3.5 ) (31.4 ) n/m Other non operating income (expense) of consolidated investment vehicles 0.1 0.7 0.2 (90.2 ) n/m Total other income (expense) (0.8 ) 0.3 (75.1 ) n/m n/m Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 13.1 12.5 (95.0 ) 10.8 n/m Income tax provision (benefit) 4.3 4.5 (36.5 ) 0.6 n/m Net Income (Loss) 8.8 8.0 (58.5 ) 16.5 n/m Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.3 ) 0.2 0.1 n/m n/m Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. 9.1 % 7.8 % (58.6 )% 24.3 n/m n/m not meaningful (1)Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 30 Table of Contents FISCAL 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2010 Financial Overview Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2011 totaled $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase in Net Income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues, reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees, reduced interest expense, and a change in the U.K. tax rate. These increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation, the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year, and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Net Income, as previously discussed, excluding the impact of the current year U.K. tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year. Operating margin increased to 13.9% from 12.2% in the prior year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) increased to 23.2% from 20.7% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our assets under management ("AUM") (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 2010 Beginning of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 49.5 38.8 Redemptions (44.3 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (52.1 ) (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2 ) (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (61.1 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other(2) 56.3 134.1 Dispositions (2.1 ) End of period $ 677.6 $ 684.5 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2011 was $678 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 1% from March 31, 2010. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $61 billion, which were partially offset by market appreciation of $56 billion, of which approximately 17% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, and dispositions of $2 billion, relating to the sale of a Singapore based Asian equity manager. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $37 billion, or 61% of the outflows, followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of $16 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset"). We have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge") and Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"), while The Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal") and Royce & Associates ("Royce) had net inflows. Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net annual equity outflows since fiscal 2007. However, the rate of outflows in this asset class was lower year over year. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney amended certain historical Smith Barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage, that resulted in a reduction of approximately $16 billion in liquidity AUM. We are currently waiving much of the management fees generated by these assets, so a loss of this AUM this year would have reduced net advisory revenue by only $8 million and not had a material impact on Net Income due to the impact of revenue sharing arrangements and income taxes. In addition, we expect further amendments to result in an additional $7 billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next 15 months. Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance. 31  Table of Contents AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Equity $ 189.6 28.0 $ 173.8 25.4 9.1 Fixed income 356.6 52.6 364.3 53.2 (2.1 ) Liquidity 131.4 19.4 146.4 21.4 (10.2 ) Total $ 677.6 100.0 $ 684.5 100.0 (1.0 ) The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2010 $ 173.8 $ 364.3 $ 146.4 $ 684.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 23.4 26.1 49.5 Redemptions (24.7 ) (19.6 ) (44.3 ) Separate account flows, net (6.9 ) (43.5 ) (1.7 ) (52.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2 ) (14.2 ) Net client cash flows (8.2 ) (37.0 ) (15.9 ) (61.1 ) Market performance and other 24.0 29.3 0.9 54.2 March 31, 2011 $ 189.6 $ 356.6 $ 131.4 $ 677.6 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Equity $ 173.8 26.0 $ 155.7 23.0 11.6 Fixed income 361.6 54.0 370.7 54.9 (2.5 ) Liquidity 133.8 20.0 149.1 22.1 (10.3 ) Total $ 669.2 100.0 $ 675.5 100.0 (0.9 ) AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Americas $ 476.8 70.4 $ 475.8 69.5 0.2 International 200.8 29.6 208.7 30.5 (3.8 ) Total $ 677.6 100.0 $ 684.5 100.0 (1.0 ) 32 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2011 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2010 $ 475.8 $ 208.7 $ 684.5 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 28.7 20.8 49.5 Redemptions (32.6 ) (11.7 ) (44.3 ) Separate account flows, net (32.0 ) (20.1 ) (52.1 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (8.1 ) (6.1 ) (14.2 ) Net client cash flows (44.0 ) (17.1 ) (61.1 ) Market performance and other 45.0 9.2 54.2 March 31, 2011 $ 476.8 $ 200.8 $ 677.6 Investment Performance(1) Investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2011 was mixed compared to relevant bench marks from the prior year. The equity markets worked through a difficult year with more recent political upheaval in the Middle East driving a significant increase in oil prices and the earthquake in Japan and subsequent nuclear crisis raising questions about the future of the nuclear power industry. Despite these global concerns, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our fourth fiscal quarter and our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions activity. In the fixed income markets, relatively strong economic data, combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise across the yield curve. The yield curve slightly flattened over the quarter and the year as the Federal Reserve kept its funds rate at 0.25% and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period. The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond Index returning 4.28%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Bond Index, which returned 14.31% followed by U.S. TIPS, as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which returned 7.91% for the year. The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Equity 42 % 57 % 61 % 77 % 49 % 61 % 72 % 86 % Fixed income 82 % 80 % 70 % 81 % 88 % 40 % 50 % 88 % (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in its marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, 89% and 87% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 89% and 82%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. 33 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category averages as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Total long term 56 % 74 % 70 % 67 % 62 % 68 % 70 % 80 % Equity 58 % 70 % 68 % 60 % 51 % 63 % 65 % 78 % Fixed income 52 % 83 % 78 % 85 % 81 % 78 % 83 % 87 % Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 % of Total 2010 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,917.9 68.9 $ 1,864.2 70.8 2.9 International 866.4 31.1 770.7 29.2 12.4 Total $ 2,784.3 100.0 $ 2,634.9 100.0 5.7 The increase in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Royce. The increase in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to increased mutual fund advisory fees and performance fees on assets managed by the international operations of Western Asset and increased fund revenues at Permal. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 34 Table of Contents Business Model Streamlining Initiative In May 2010, we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes: (i) transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships; and (ii) sharing in affiliate revenue with our Americas distribution group. We project that the initiative will result in $130 million to $150 million in expense reductions that will be fully realized on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These expense savings consist of (i) approximately $75 million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates, and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements; (ii) approximately $50 million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units, including savings associated with consolidating office space; and (iii) approximately $15 million from our Americas distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements. The initiative involves approximately $115 million to $135 million in transition related costs that primarily include charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period. The transition related costs will also include charges for consolidating leased office space, early contract terminations, asset disposals and professional fees. During fiscal 2011, transition related costs totaled $54.4 million, which, net of related cost savings, reduced our operating income by $42 million. Substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal 2012. The nature and amount of transition costs and savings are based on estimates. While management expects the total costs and savings to be within the ranges disclosed, actual results may differ in amount and nature from these estimates. The achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements, as well as the amount and nature of transition related costs, will be subject to many factors, including market conditions and other factors affecting our financial results, and those of our affiliates, and the rate of AUM growth. In addition, our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support our business. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of a new accounting standard on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity ("CLO"). The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non operating income (expense), is reflected in our Net Income, net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the consolidation of investment vehicles is presented in our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles" (See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information). Also, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles. Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2011 were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from $2.6 billion in the prior year, despite a 1% decrease in average AUM, reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees. These increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at $815.6 million, as a decrease of $25.4 million, resulting from lower average fixed income assets at Western Asset, was offset by an $18.6 million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. ("Batterymarch") and Royce, a $5.1 million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine Global Management, LLC ("Brandywine"), and a $2.2 million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain CLOs managed by Western Asset. Investment advisory fees from funds increased $119.3 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion. Of this increase, $111.5 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at Royce, Permal, and ClearBridge, and 35 Table of Contents $84.4 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset and a $36.0 million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset, primarily to maintain certain yields to investors. Performance fees increased 35%, or $25.2 million, to $96.7 million during fiscal 2011, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine. Distribution and service fees increased 1% to $379.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses Total compensation and benefits increased $74.1 million to $1.2 billion. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation of $45.0 million, which represents severance and retention incentive costs, increased $29.0 million, or 3%, to $1.14 billion. This increase was driven by a $68.6 million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal 2011 and a $7.5 million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are recorded in Other non operating income (expense), as well as, a $6.1 million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates. The impact of reduced headcount, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives, also reduced compensation and benefits by $6.0 million. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.6% from 42.2% in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation, and transition related compensation. These increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues. We have an arrangement with an affiliate under which the affiliates incentive compensation pool under a revenue sharing agreement has been reduced over the last two years to reimburse the parent company for certain expenses, while at the same time the parent company has provided an equivalent amount of deferred compensation to the affiliates employees. A portion of the deferred compensation was granted in the form of restricted stock awards and the remainder in cash awards granted under a non qualified plan, both of which will vest over periods of three to four years. The amount by which the affiliates incentive compensation will be reduced in fiscal 2012 under the arrangement will be significantly less than the reduction in fiscal 2011. In addition, there will be an increase in the amount of non cash amortization expense associated with the vesting of the deferred compensation awards from prior years. The combined impact will result in a $74 million increase in compensation and benefits in fiscal 2012, which will be recognized ratably over the year. This arrangement will continue for the subsequent five years, however, the incremental effect on compensation expense from year to year will be far less significant. Distribution and servicing expenses increased 3% to $712.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of $14.5 million in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 1% to $162.0 million, of which $9.2 million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during the current year, offset in part by a $6.6 million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives. Occupancy expense decreased 12% to $137.9 million, primarily due to the impact of a $19.3 million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at $22.9 million. Other expenses increased $8.9 million to $176.6 million, primarily as a result of a $10.3 million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs, a $5.6 million increase in state franchise taxes, a $4.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $5.4 million increase in charges 36 Table of Contents related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These increases were offset in part by the impact of a $19.0 million investor settlement in the prior year. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income increased 26% to $9.2 million driven by higher average interest rates, offset in part by a $0.9 million decrease due to lower average investment balances. Interest expense decreased 27% to $92.2 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009 and the repayment of the $550 million outstanding term loan balance in January 2010, which reduced interest expense by $14.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2010, all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms. Fund support gains were $23.2 million in the prior year. The gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds. Other non operating income (expense) decreased $27.3 million, primarily as a result of a $46.7 million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and a $4.3 million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of our Equity Units in the prior year. Other non operating income (expense) of CIVs decreased $15.6 million, to a gain of $1.7 million, due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a CIV. Income Tax Provision The provision for income taxes was $119.4 million compared to $118.7 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2011, the U.K. Finance Bill of 2010 was enacted, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 27% for periods beginning after April 1, 2011. The impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million. The effective tax rate was 32.7% compared to 36.0% in the prior year. The effective tax rate, excluding the impact of CIVs, was 32.0% and 36.7% as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the U.K. tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes. In addition, the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions. Although not yet enacted, additional proposed reductions in the U.K. corporate tax rate to 26% in fiscal 2012 and 25% in fiscal 2013 are expected. Each one percentage point reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate will result in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million at the time of enactment, based on the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2011, that have to be revalued at the new rate. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles Effective with the April 1, 2010 adoption of a new financial accounting standard on consolidation, we now consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a CLO. In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles," we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs. We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the CIVs from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees earned by Legg Mason from CIVs are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs are removed from the GAAP basis Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to us. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding 37 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non GAAP basis of other companies. The following tables present a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs Total operating revenues $ 2,784,317 $ 4,133 $ 2,788,450 $ 2,634,879 $ 2,779 $ 2,637,658 Total operating expenses 2,397,509 (571 ) 2,396,938 2,313,696 680 2,314,376 Operating Income 386,808 4,704 391,512 321,183 2,099 323,282 Other non operating income (expense) (21,611 ) 3,680 (17,931 ) 8,473 (8,520 ) (47 ) Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 365,197 8,384 373,581 329,656 (6,421 ) 323,235 Income tax provision 119,434 119,434 118,676 118,676 Net Income (Loss) 245,763 8,384 254,147 210,980 (6,421 ) 204,559 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (8,160 ) 8,384 224 6,623 (6,421 ) 202 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 253,923 $ $ 253,923 $ 204,357 $ $ 204,357 Adjusted Income As supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non GAAP") for "Adjusted Income" that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of Legg Mason, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We define "Adjusted Income" as Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as impairment charges and the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, and net money market fund support losses (gains). We believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business. Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, is most readily reconcilable to Net Income determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income, but is not a substitute for Net Income and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider Adjusted Income 38 Table of Contents to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, issued contingent convertible debt, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. In calculating Adjusted Income we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carryforward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and U.K. tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle ("SIV") securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments. Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures. Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement. 39 Table of Contents A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 253,923 $ 204,357 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,913 22,769 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 134,602 136,252 U.K. tax rate adjustment (8,878 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 36,688 34,445 Net money market fund support gains(1) (16,565 ) Adjusted Income $ 439,248 $ 381,258 Net Income per diluted share Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.63 $ 1.32 Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.15 0.14 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.87 0.88 U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.06 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.24 0.22 Net money market fund support gains(1) (0.11 ) Adjusted Income per diluted share $ 2.83 $ 2.45 (1)Net of income taxes. Operating Margin, as Adjusted We calculate "Operating Margin, as Adjusted," by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of CIVs, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "adjusted operating revenues." The compensation items, other than transition related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income. Transition related costs and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Adjusted operating revenues also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP. We believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a 40 Table of Contents substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins, of other companies. The calculation of operating margin and operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $ 2,784,317 $ 2,634,879 Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 4,133 2,779 Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (712,779 ) (691,868 ) Operating Revenues, as adjusted $ 2,075,671 $ 1,945,790 Operating Income $ 386,808 $ 321,183 Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 36,274 79,316 Transition related costs 54,434 Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 4,704 2,099 Operating Income, as Adjusted $ 482,220 $ 402,598 Operating margin, GAAP basis 13.9 % 12.2 % Operating margin, as adjusted 23.2 20.7 41  Table of Contents FISCAL 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2009 Financial Overview Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2010 totaled $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to Net loss attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $1.97 billion, or $13.99 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.4 billion of losses, net of income tax benefits and compensation related adjustments, related to the elimination of the exposure to SIVs in liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary in the prior fiscal year. The impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, primarily in our former Wealth Management division (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $863.4 million, net of income tax benefits, recorded in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the increase. Adjusted income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted loss of $1.2 billion, or $8.47 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the impact of $1.7 billion of net realized losses on the sale of SIV securities in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin increased to 12.2% from (19.9)% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the prior fiscal year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to 20.7% from 23.9% in the prior year. Assets Under Management The components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 2009 Beginning of period $ 632.4 $ 950.1 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 38.8 43.7 Redemptions (40.2 ) (78.6 ) Separate account flows, net (76.5 ) (109.0 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (15.0 ) Net client cash flows (82.0 ) (158.9 ) Market performance and other(2) 134.1 (157.7 ) Dispositions (1.1 ) End of period $ 684.5 $ 632.4 (1)Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2)Includes impact of foreign exchange. AUM at March 31, 2010 were $685 billion, an increase of $52 billion or 8% from March 31, 2009. The increase in AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $134 billion, of which approximately 6% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, which was partially offset by net client outflows of $82 billion. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $64 billion, or 78% of the outflows, followed by equity outflows and liquidity outflows of $15 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset and Brandywine that had experienced past investment underperformance, although their performance improved significantly during fiscal 2010. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge, Batterymarch, Permal and LMCM. AUM by Asset Class AUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Equity $ 173.8 25.4 $ 126.9 20.1 37.0 Fixed income 364.3 53.2 357.6 56.5 1.9 Liquidity 146.4 21.4 147.9 23.4 (1.0 ) Total $ 684.5 100.0 $ 632.4 100.0 8.2 42 Table of Contents The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 were as follows: Equity Fixed Income Liquidity Total March 31, 2009 $ 126.9 $ 357.6 $ 147.9 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 18.7 20.1 38.8 Redemptions (23.4 ) (16.8 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (10.7 ) (67.3 ) 1.5 (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (4.1 ) (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (15.4 ) (64.0 ) (2.6 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other 62.3 70.7 1.1 134.1 March 31, 2010 $ 173.8 $ 364.3 $ 146.4 $ 684.5 Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Equity $ 155.7 23.0 $ 203.2 25.1 (23.4 ) Fixed income 370.7 54.9 438.0 54.0 (15.4 ) Liquidity 149.1 22.1 169.2 20.9 (11.9 ) Total $ 675.5 100.0 $ 810.4 100.0 (16.6 ) AUM by Division AUM by division (in billions) as of March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 475.8 69.5 $ 446.7 70.6 6.5 International 208.7 30.5 185.7 29.4 12.4 Total $ 684.5 100.0 $ 632.4 100.0 8.2 The component changes in our AUM by division (in billions) for the year ended March 31, 2010 were as follows: Americas International Total March 31, 2009 $ 446.7 $ 185.7 $ 632.4 Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 24.4 14.4 38.8 Redemptions (26.2 ) (14.0 ) (40.2 ) Separate account flows, net (50.7 ) (25.8 ) (76.5 ) Liquidity fund flows, net (18.6 ) 14.5 (4.1 ) Net client cash flows (71.1 ) (10.9 ) (82.0 ) Market performance and other 100.2 33.9 134.1 March 31, 2010 $ 475.8 $ 208.7 $ 684.5 43 Table of Contents Investment Performance(1) Investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2010 improved compared to relevant benchmarks from the prior year. Although the unemployment rate remains high, the U.S. economy continued to slowly show signs of recovery. A strong rebound in corporate earnings, improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending, and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence. However, uncertainty in the markets remained, as best evidenced by the May 6, 2010 intraday sell off and subsequent rebound. With concerns regarding the credit quality of certain European nations, and as government stimulus initiatives continued globally, debates about inflation and deflation loomed. In the fixed income markets, government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk. Most sector spreads declined in 2009 as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities. Investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with 2000 basis points in excess returns over treasuries in 2009. For the 1 year period, the Treasury yield curve was historically steep as the Federal Reserve continued to keep federal funds at close to 0%. The worst performing fixed income sector was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond returning (3.70)%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds which returned 58.21% for 2009. The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Equity 49 % 61 % 72 % 86 % 49 % 53 % 58 % 88 % Fixed income 88 % 40 % 50 % 88 % 31 % 12 % 32 % 17 % The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2010 As of March 31, 2009 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Total long term 62 % 68 % 70 % 80 % 43 % 52 % 47 % 75 % Equity 51 % 63 % 65 % 78 % 47 % 60 % 49 % 76 % Fixed income 81 % 78 % 83 % 87 % 38 % 41 % 45 % 72 % Revenue by Division Operating revenues by division (in millions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change Americas $ 1,864.2 70.8 $ 2,290.5 68.2 (18.6 ) International 770.7 29.2 1,066.9 31.8 (27.8 ) Total $ 2,634.9 100.0 $ 3,357.4 100.0 (21.5 ) The decrease in operating revenues in the Americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset, LMCM, and ClearBridge, decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by Western Asset and ClearBridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from U.S. retail equity funds. The decrease in operating revenues in the International division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at Permal. (1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. (2)As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, 87% and 85% of our equity assets under management, respectively, in each period, and 82% and 84%, of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites. (3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 16% and 12%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites. 44 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2010 were $2.6 billion, down 22% from $3.4 billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a 17% decrease in average AUM. The shift in the mix of average AUM from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline. Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $202.4 million, or 20%, to $814.8 million. Of this decrease, $104.3 million was the result of lower average equity assets at ClearBridge, Private Capital Management, LP ("PCM"), LMCM and Brandywine, and $95.5 million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. Investment advisory fees from funds decreased $469.1 million, or 26%, to $1.4 billion. Of this decrease, $309.2 million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at Permal, LMCM, and ClearBridge, $73.1 million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors, and $66.9 million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset. Performance fees increased 310%, or $54.0 million, to $71.5 million during fiscal 2010, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset and Permal. Distribution and service fees decreased 21% to $375.3 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund AUM and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset. Operating Expenses As a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal 2009 due to challenging market conditions, actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure. These cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions, significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects, and substantial curtailment of promotional costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 2010 continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal 2009, with many of the more significant actions implemented in the December 2008 quarter. The discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal 2010, where applicable. Compensation and benefits decreased 2% to $1.1 billion. This decrease was driven by a $139.1 million decrease in revenue share based compensation, primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal 2010, the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates. The net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately $27.5 million. These reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $150.3 million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by gains in other non operating income (expense). Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.2% from 33.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues. Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 29% to $691.9 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors. Communications and technology expense decreased 13% to $163.1 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a $13.6 million reduction in technology consulting fees, telecommunications and market data services. Reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense, which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2010, of $7.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, also contributed to the decrease. Occupancy expense decreased 25% to $157.0 million, primarily due to the recognition of $70.1 million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year, offset in part by a $19.3 million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 38% to $22.8 million, primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2009, which reduced amortization expense by $13.5 million. 45 Table of Contents Impairment charges were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Approximately $1.2 billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former Wealth Management division as a result of significant declines in the AUM and projected cash flows within that division. The remaining $146 million related to certain acquired management contracts, as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition, and the impairment of a trade name. Other expenses decreased $14.4 million to $167.6 million, primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of $15.6 million, and advertising costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.5 million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors. Non Operating Income (Expense) Interest income decreased 87% to $7.4 million, primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances, which reduced interest income by $36.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Interest expense decreased 31% to $126.3 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009, which reduced interest expense by $36.5 million, and a $24.6 million decrease due to the repayment of $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in March 2009, the repayment of our 6.75% senior notes in July 2008, the repayment of the $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million term loan in January 2010, as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal 2010. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $5.0 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily related to the early repayment of our $700 million term loan. Due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds, in fiscal 2010 we reversed unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 of $20.6 million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve SIVs. During fiscal 2009, fund support losses were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of SIV price deterioration and our elimination of SIV exposure. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fund support. Other non operating income (expense) increased $203.9 million to income of $86.9 million, primarily as a result of an increase of $133.7 million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above, and $86.9 million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products, which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our Equity Units in fiscal 2010. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) The provision for income taxes was $118.7 million compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate was 36.0% compared to a benefit rate of 38.4% in the prior year. The current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The prior years benefit rate was driven by the impact of the SIV related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge, offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary. 46 Table of Contents Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles The following tables present a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs Total operating revenues $ 2,634,879 $ 2,779 $ 2,637,658 $ 3,357,367 $ 1,232 $ 3,358,599 Total operating expenses 2,313,696 680 2,314,376 4,026,547 (705 ) 4,025,842 Operating Income 321,183 2,099 323,282 (669,180 ) 1,937 (667,243 ) Other non operating income (expense) 8,473 (8,520 ) (47 ) (2,519,017 ) (4,705 ) (2,523,722 ) Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 329,656 (6,421 ) 323,235 (3,188,197 ) (2,768 ) (3,190,965 ) Income tax provision 118,676 118,676 (1,223,203 ) (1,223,203 ) Net Income (Loss) 210,980 (6,421 ) 204,559 (1,964,994 ) (2,768 ) (1,967,762 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 6,623 (6,421 ) 202 2,924 (2,768 ) 156 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) $ $ (1,967,918 ) 47 Table of Contents Adjusted Income A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $ 204,357 $ (1,967,918 ) Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,769 36,488 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 136,252 142,494 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (444,618 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 34,445 32,340 Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (16,565 ) 1,376,579 Impairment charges 1,307,970 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (1,674,724 ) Adjusted Income $ 381,258 $ (1,191,389 ) Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $ 1.32 $ (13.99 ) Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.26 Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.88 1.01 Deferred income taxes on impairment charges (3.16 ) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.22 0.23 Net money market fund support (gains) losses(1) (0.11 ) 9.79 Impairment charges 9.30 Net loss on sale of SIV securities(1) (11.91 ) Adjusted income per diluted share $ 2.45 $ (8.47 ) (1)Includes related adjustments to operating expenses, if applicable, and income tax provision (benefit).

Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt. The consolidation of variable interest entities as of April 1, 2010 under new accounting guidance, as further discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, did not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs, beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations. Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of operations. At March 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.4 billion, $8.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. Total assets and total liabilities of the CIVs at March 31, 2011 were $437 million and $337 million, respectively. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities $ 412.1 $ 1,413.1 $ 382.0 Cash flows used for investing activities (44.4 ) (276.7 ) (1,090.9 ) Cash flows (used for) from financing activities (468.5 ) (746.7 ) 329.2 Effect of exchange rate changes 10.8 19.5 (27.2 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (90.0 ) 409.2 (406.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 1,465.9 1,056.7 1,463.6 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 1,375.9 $ 1,465.9 $ 1,056.7 During fiscal 2011, our cash flows from operating activities were $412.1 million, primarily attributable to our current year net income adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2011 were $44.4 million, primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows for financing activities of $468.5 million, were driven by the repurchase of 14.6 million of our common shares for $445 million. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2010, cash flows from operating activities were $1,413.1 million, of which $1.0 billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks. The remainder was attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements. Cash outflows for financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million five year term loan, $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the Equity Units exchange offer and the payment of cash dividends. During fiscal 2009, cash flows from operations were $382.0 million, primarily attributable to revenue declines. Cash outflows for investing activities were $1.1 billion during fiscal 2009, primarily attributable to the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds, which used $2.9 billion. These outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and SIV securities of $1.1 billion, cash proceeds received for the sale of the implementation and overlay business of Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group ("LMPPG") of $181 million, and the return of a portion of a contingent earn out payment from the acquisition of PCM of $120 million that was previously funded into escrow. Cash flows from financing activities provided $329.2 million during fiscal 2009, primarily due to $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the offering of Equity Units, offset in part by the repayment of $425 million of 6.75% senior notes and a $250 million repayment on our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Financing Transactions The table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2011: Amount Outstanding at March 31, Total at March 31, 2011 Type 2011 2010 Interest Rate Maturity 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 1,250,000 $ 1,087,932 $ 1,051,243 2.50% January 2015 5.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 103,039 103,039 5.60% June 2021 Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013 50 Table of Contents During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2011 and 2010 of approximately $36.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consists of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% Senior Notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. The notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments, but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. Approximately 2.1 million Equity Units with $103 million of 5.6% Senior Notes remain outstanding. We are in the process of evaluating our options for remarketing the Senior Notes by June 30, 2011. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. The facility was scheduled to mature on October 14, 2010; however, in fiscal 2010, the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to February 11, 2013 and modify covenants, as discussed below. In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt. The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5. In order to complete the May 2008 issuance of the Equity Units, we received a waiver of the covenant under which we are prevented from issuing more than $250 million in additional debt at any time when our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. Upon expiration of this waiver on June 30, 2011, we will be unable to incur any additional debt if our debt to EBITDA ratio exceeds 2.5. As of March 31, 2011, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6 and thus the only new debt we could have incurred would be allowed by the covenant exceptions. At March 31, 2011, our financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $375 million. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, and any non cash charges, as defined. As of March 31, 2011, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 12.9. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2011. If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, 51 Table of Contents we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments. Our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade by both rating agencies, the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase. Other Transactions During fiscal 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Permal, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010 and 2009, we paid an aggregate amount of $15.0 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill. During fiscal 2010, we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In May 2010, 1.1 million shares, representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2007, in connection with the acquisition of PCM, we paid into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of $300 million of which $150 million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until July 2009. During fiscal 2009, the contingency was settled at which time $30 million was released from escrow to the sellers and $120 million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill. In April 2008, we completed a sale in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an affiliate of Citigroup, acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of LMPPG, including its managed account trading and technology platform. The sale produced cash proceeds of approximately $181 million. Certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Certain affiliates are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements. Liquidity Fund Support During fiscal 2009, we had arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold, or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling, all outstanding securities issued by SIVs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our affiliates, the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements. During fiscal 2009, we also sold Canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to SIV securities. As of March 31, 2010 all support arrangements were terminated or expired. During fiscal 2009, we paid $2.9 billion for an aggregate $3.0 billion in principal amount (plus $24 million of accrued interest) of non bank sponsored SIV securities from certain liquidity funds that were previously supported under various capital support agreements ("CSAs") and letters of credit ("LOCs"). Upon the purchase of these securities, the CSAs and LOCs were terminated in accordance with their terms. Collateral of $2.0 billion was returned, which included the return of $1.3 billion of collateral provided during fiscal 2009 to support new or amended CSAs and LOCs. During fiscal 2009, the $3.0 billion of purchased securities were sold along with $355 million of securities previously supported by a total return swap ("TRS") and $76 million of Canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet, to third parties for $627.3 million, net of transaction costs. The TRS terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and $209 million of collateral was returned. During fiscal 2009, we also paid $181.2 million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling SIV securities. During fiscal 2010, the four remaining CSAs to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were 52 Table of Contents terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder and $42 million of collateral was returned. Future Outlook We expect that over the next 12 months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. In addition to our ordinary operating cash needs, as described above, we anticipate other cash needs during the next 12 months. In connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model, we expect to incur transition related costs in the range of $115 million to $135 million through March 2012, of which approximately 15% are non cash charges. During fiscal 2011, $54.4 million of these costs were accrued and substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal 2012. A significant portion of the accrued costs will be paid in fiscal 2012. We project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately $130 million to $150 million, excluding costs to achieve these savings, and expect to achieve these savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal 2011. We currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, as further discussed below, repayment of outstanding debt, payment of increased dividends, or acquisitions. As described above, we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our iquidity needs. We also currently have approximately $1.0 billion in cash in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to $400 million of our common stock by the end of fiscal 2012, subject to market conditions and our performance, actual cash flows, and other capital needs. These repurchases will be made under the current Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock, announced in May 2010, of which $555 million remains unused as of March 31, 2011. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events resulted in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt. Credit and Liquidity Risk Cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation and Liquidity Fund Support discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 18 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously discussed, during fiscal 2009 we had various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds. These arrangements, all of which were terminated or expired prior to March 31, 2010, included letters of credit, capital support agreements and a TRS. 53 Table of Contents In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual and Contingent Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 Long term borrowings by contract maturity(2) 1.0 1.2 1.3 1,251.3 6.1 103.0 1,363.9 Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2)(3) 46.3 39.0 38.9 38.9 7.5 37.9 208.5 Minimum rental and service commitments 142.3 124.0 100.1 90.0 83.1 522.1 1,061.6 Total Contractual Obligations(4)(5)(6)(7) $ 439.6 $ 164.2 $ 140.3 $ 1,380.2 $ 96.7 $ 663.0 $ 2,884.0 (1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose. (2)Excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated CLO of $278.3 million and interest on these long term borrowings, as applicable. The amount in thereafter is contractually due fiscal 2022, subject to potential remarketing as further described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3)Interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2011. (4)In connection with our restructuring plans, we no longer intend to exercise a put/purchase option on land and a building that was treated as a capital lease. The remaining rental commitment for this facility is included in minimum rental and service commitments above. (5)The table above does not include approximately $23.4 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal 2018. (6)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $60.2 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities) because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated. (7)The table above does not include amounts related to our business streamlining initiatives. 54  Table of Contents MARKET RISK The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk. Revenues and Net Income The majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. Trading and Non Trading Assets Our trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products. Trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2011 and 2010 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2011 2010 Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $ 120,107 $ 118,096 Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 204,063 142,497 Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 76,340 74,280 Total trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs $ 400,510 $ 334,873 Approximately $96.0 million and $149.8 million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading and other current investments of $72.6 million and $17.3 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income and net income. Approximately $231.9 million and $167.7 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $30.9 million and $33.0 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $39.8 and $19.3 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy. 55 Table of Contents Non trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2011 and 2010 subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2011 2010 Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Available for sale $ 11,300 $ 6,957 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 22,167 23,049 Equity method investments in partnerships, LLCs, and other 155,351 100,160 Other investments 270 1,452 Total non trading assets, excluding CIVs $ 189,088 $ 131,618 Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2011 and 2010 includes approximately $91.9 million and $55.7 million, respectively, of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program ("PPIP"). Investment securities of CIVs totaled $82.8 million and $37.2 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and investments of CIVs totaled $312.8 million and $13.7 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we held equity investments in the CIVs of $53.7 million and $61.9 million, respectively. Fluctuations in the market value of investments of CIVs in excess of our equity investment will not impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. However, it may have an impact on other non operating income (expense) of CIVs with a corresponding offset in net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests. Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." See Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives. The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2011: Carrying Value Fair Value Assuming a 20% Increase(1) Fair Value Assuming a 20% Decrease(1) Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments related to deferred compensation plans $ 120,107 $ 144,128 $ 96,086 Trading proprietary fund products and other 204,063 244,876 163,250 Equity method investments relating to deferred compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 76,340 91,608 61,072 Total current investments, excluding CIVs 400,510 480,612 320,408 Net investments in CIVs 53,708 64,450 42,966 Available for sale investments 11,300 13,560 9,040 Investments in partnerships and LLCs 22,167 26,600 17,734 Equity method investments in partnerships, LLCs, and other 155,351 186,421 124,281 Other investments 270 324 216 Total investments subject to market risk $ 643,306 $ 771,967 $ 514,645 (1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $39.8 million have been hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $70.3 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of March 31, 2011. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Sensitivity We operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Australia, may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk Exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately $250.0 million and $253.6 million, respectively, of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2011, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments. Consolidation Effective April 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, "Consolidation," (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R)") ("SFAS No. 167"), relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") which includes a new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE, changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE, and changes in the assessment of which entities are VIEs. The application of the new accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds, including money market funds. Investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46(R)"). In the normal course of our business, we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles. Certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be VIEs while others are considered to be voting rights entities ("VREs") subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were not material at March 31, 2011. We have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these VIEs, VREs or their investors. Investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle. FIN 46(R) For sponsored investment funds, including money market funds, which qualify for the deferral of new accounting guidance, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker. It is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for VIEs created to manage assets for clients which qualify for the deferral unless our ownership interest, including interests of related parties, is 57 Table of Contents substantial, unless we may earn significant performance fees from the VIE or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest in the VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE which qualifies for the deferral, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary. SFAS No. 167 We sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities ("CDOs") and CLOs that do not qualify for the deferral, and are assessed under the new accounting guidance, as follows. We determine whether we have a variable interest in a VIE by considering if, among other things, we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that are expected to be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return. If we have a significant variable interest, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is insignificant. Under both the new accounting guidance and prior guidance, Legg Mason must consolidate VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs. Revenue Recognition The vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith. For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian. Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the 58 Table of Contents last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2011, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $189.6 billion, $356.6 billion, and $131.4 billion, respectively. As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2011, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. Valuation of Financial Instruments Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except Legg Masons long term debt. Trading investments, Investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. For equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investees net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non operating income (expense). For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. In fiscal 2009, we had in place various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions. The fair values of these derivative instruments were based on managements estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses. During fiscal 2009, we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by SIVs held in our liquidity funds, effectively 59 Table of Contents eliminating our exposure to SIVs, and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase. As of March 31, 2009, four capital support arrangements, which supported investments in non asset backed securities, remained outstanding. During fiscal 2010, these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of $20.6 million were recovered. None of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and the related gains and losses are included in Fund support in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010 and 2009. For investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, excluding investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $23.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, we also have approximately $177.5 million and $123.2 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $155.4 million and $100.2 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is accounted for under the cost method. In addition, as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $76.3 million and $74.3 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance. The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets. Level 2 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. This category also includes CLO loans and liabilities of a CIV. Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. Previously, this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by SIVs. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and CLO debt of a CIV. The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Proprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at NAV determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market 60 Table of Contents prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3. The fair values of CLO loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as Level 2. Legg Mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. The fair value of CLO debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the CLOs underlying collateral assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement, the CLO debt valuation is classified as Level 3. Exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale, the last offering price. Options traded over the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations. Options are classified as Level 1. Futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps are valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and are classified as Level 2. As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 3% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 10% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 2% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Goodwill Balances as of March 31, 2011 are as follows: Americas International Total Asset management contracts $ 48,692 $ 4,626 $ 53,318 Indefinite life intangible assets 2,601,551 1,152,106 3,753,657 Trade names 7,700 62,100 69,800 Goodwill 907,079 404,573 1,311,652 $ 3,565,022 $ 1,623,405 $ 5,188,427 Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. 61  Table of Contents In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below. For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, internal budgets, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2010, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of December 31, 2010. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2011, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2011, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. Amortizable Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from 1 to 7 years with a weighted average life of approximately 3.6 years. Indefinite Life Intangible Assets For intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names. We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the 62 Table of Contents carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary. Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million and the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 65% and 25%, respectively, of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2010 annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 8%. Cash flows on the Permal contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 9%. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 13.2% and 14.5%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 20% and 25%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 15.0% and 17.0%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $628 million and $321 million, respectively. Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts. Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. We have defined the reporting units to be the Americas and International divisions, which are the same as our operating segments. Allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure, acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments. Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity), by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows. Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values. 63 Table of Contents Goodwill in the Americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM and Royce. The value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our U.S. mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our U.S. managers. Goodwill in the International reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of Permal and the international CAM businesses. For our December 31, 2010 annual impairment test, the projected cash flows were discounted at 13.2% and 14.0%, respectively, for the Americas and International divisions to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2010, the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the Americas and International divisions. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the Americas division, were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 10%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 8%. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the International division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately 8%, with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Cash flow growth for the Americas and International divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections were based on historical trends, in context with our long term growth experience, budgets, and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager, budgets, and market influences relevant to their business. Long term growth is based on our historical experience, available historic market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the Americas and International reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately 47% and 50%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately 5.9 and 7.0 percentage points, respectively, for goodwill to be considered for impairment. As of December 31, 2010, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team, which, among other things, will eliminate the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions into one Global Asset Management business during fiscal 2012. However, as of March 31, 2011, our internal management reporting has not changed. As a result, the Americas and International operating segments continued to be our reporting units. Stock Based Compensation Our stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital. Also under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows. We granted 0.7 million, 1.5 million, and 1.5 million stock options in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date 64 Table of Contents of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision. Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.") taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2011, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $683 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.6 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $129 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to $3.1 million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance has been established with respect thereto. As of March 31, 2011, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $222 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $0.7 million for fiscal 2011. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. As of March 31, 2011, U.K. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, are not material. An additional valuation allowance was recorded on $3.0 million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions, principally relating to foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in equity. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in 65 Table of Contents revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, including expected earnings per share in future periods, anticipated future investment performance of our affiliates, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of AUM; the mix of our AUM among our affiliates; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products compared with competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.
