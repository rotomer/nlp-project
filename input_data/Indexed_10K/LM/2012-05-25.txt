MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWLegg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America ("U.S.") and the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. All references to fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010, refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason.In connection with a realignment of our executive management team during fiscal 2011, we no longer manage our business in two divisions and, during fiscal 2012, eliminated the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions and combined them into one operating segment, Global Asset Management. We believe this structure allows us to function as a global organization with a single purpose. As a result of this change, we no longer present assets under management ("AUM") or revenues by division.Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our AUM and fee rates, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain AUM and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our AUM primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions.The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, the asset management affiliate that provides the services, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our AUM. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one affiliate can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate. In addition, from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability.The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels, non compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share based affiliates, and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity.Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but also in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our AUM, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key 23employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the last few years, the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share. In addition, the economic downturn of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contributed to a significant contraction in our business and we have not recovered to pre downturn levels. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, and in prior years, by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions.The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability.Our strategy is focused on three primary areas listed below. Management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition. Consistent with this approach, we have also listed below the most important matters on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition.Outstanding independent investment managers:The investment performance of our asset management products and services compared to their benchmarks and to the performance of competitive products for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods.Our AUM, the components of the changes in our AUM amid continued market uncertainty, the long term trend of outflows in AUM, and the resulting impact of changes in AUM on our revenues.A corporate center that delivers strategic value:Promote revenue growth through strategic marketing of products to institutional clients, supported by retail and instividual (e.g., 401(k) plans) distribution globally.Management of expenses.Allocating capital for diversified growth and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate:The amount of excess capital we generate, and deployment of that capital through share repurchases, investments in proprietary fund products, dividends and targeted acquisitions.The following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAlthough the financial environment, both globally and in the U.S., continued to rebound during fiscal 2012, challenging and volatile conditions persisted throughout a portion of our fiscal year. Economic uncertainties related to the European debt crisis slowed the global economy, and the unprecedented downgrade to the U.S. credit rating in August 2011 contributed to a sharp decline in the equity markets during the first half of fiscal 2012. In spite of the challenging conditions during the first half of our fiscal year, economic interventions which eased the European debt crisis, and continuing improvement in U.S. employment rates and consumer confidence, resulted in equity market increases during the second half of the fiscal year which more than offset earlier market declines. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve Board held the federal funds rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. While the economic outlook has been more positive than in recent years, the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging, as we move into fiscal 2013.All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below: % Change as of and for the year ended March 31:Indices(1) 2012 2011Dow Jones Industrial Average 7.24% 13.48%S&P 500 6.23% 13.37%NASDAQ Composite Index 11.16% 15.98%Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 7.71% 5.12%Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index 5.26% 7.15%(1)Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. 24The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change(1) Years EndedMarch 31, 2012Compared 2011Compared 2012 2011 2010 to 2011 to 2010Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 29.1% 29.3% 30.9% (4.9)% 0.1%Funds 56.0 53.4 51.9 0.3 8.7Performance fees 1.9 3.5 2.7 (48.8) 35.3Distribution and service fees 12.8 13.6 14.3 (10.1) 1.0Other 0.2 0.2 0.2 (16.0) 4.6Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 (4.4) 5.7Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 41.7 41.0 42.2 (2.7) 2.6Transition related compensation 1.3 1.6 (23.1) n/m Total compensation and benefits 43.0 42.6 42.2 (3.5) 6.7Distribution and servicing 24.4 25.6 26.3 (8.9) 3.0Communications and technology 6.2 5.8 6.2 1.7 (0.7)Occupancy 5.8 5.0 6.0 12.3 (12.2)Amortization of intangible assets 0.7 0.8 0.8 (14.6) 0.6Other 7.2 6.3 6.3 8.0 5.3Total operating expenses 87.3 86.1 87.8 (3.1) 3.6Operating Income 12.7 13.9 12.2 (12.4) 20.4Other Income (Expense) Interest income 0.4 0.3 0.3 24.2 25.7Interest expense (3.3) (3.3) (4.8) (5.0) (27.0)Fund support 0.9 n/m n/mOther 0.8 2.1 3.2 (62.9) (31.4)Other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles 0.8 0.1 0.7 (65.1) (90.2)Total other income (expense) (1.3) (0.8) 0.3 n/m n/mIncome before Income Tax Provision 11.4 13.1 12.5 (17.0) 10.8Income tax provision 2.7 4.3 4.5 (39.7) 0.6Net Income 8.7 8.8 8.0 (6.0) 16.5Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 (0.3) 0.2 n/m n/mNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. 8.3% 9.1% 7.8% (13.0)% 24.3%n/m not meaningful(1) Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 25FISCAL 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2011Financial OverviewNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2012, totaled $220.8 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in the prior year. The decrease in Net Income was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset"), the impact of net market losses on proprietary fund products and assets invested for deferred compensation plans which are not offset in compensation and benefits, and the net impact of decreased operating revenues. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of cost savings due to our business streamlining initiative, and the impact of tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary and U.K. tax rate changes. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to $397.0 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2012, from $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in Net Income, previously discussed, excluding the impact of U.K. tax rate adjustments. Operating margin decreased to 12.7% from 13.9% in the prior year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, was 21.3% and 23.2%, respectively.Assets Under ManagementThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31, were as follows: 2012 2011Beginning of period $677.6 $684.5Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 46.9 49.5Redemptions (51.1) (44.3)Separate account flows, net (35.9) (52.1)Liquidity fund flows, net 12.6 (14.2)Net client cash flows (27.5) (61.1)Market performance and other (2) 17.1 56.3Dispositions (23.9) (2.1)End of period $643.3 $677.6(1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2) Includes impact of foreign exchange, reinvestment of dividends, and other. AUM at March 31, 2012, was $643.3 billion, a decrease of $34.3 billion, or 5%, from March 31, 2011. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $27.5 billion and dispositions of $23.9 billion, which were partially offset by market performance and other of $17.1 billion, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The majority of dispositions were in liquidity assets, $19.9 billion, which resulted from the amendment of historical Smith Barney brokerage programs discussed below. There were also $4.0 billion in dispositions from the divestiture of two small affiliates. Long term asset classes accounted for the net client outflows, with $21.3 billion and $18.6 billion in equity and fixed income outflows, respectively, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $12.4 billion. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"), ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. (Batterymarch) and Royce & Associates (Royce). Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net annual outflows in our equity asset class since fiscal 2007. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset, including $12.7 billion in outflows from a single, low fee global sovereign mandate. We expect to continue to experience outflows from this mandate of approximately $1 billion per month during fiscal 2013. With the exception of the June 2011 quarter, we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and Net Income than would outflows in other asset classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ("MSSB") amended certain historical Smith Barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage that resulted in a reduction of $19.9 billion in liquidity AUM during the year ended March 31, 2012. As a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition, the disposition of this liquidity AUM resulted in a reduction in operating revenue of $52.3 million, net of related fee waivers, in the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011. The disposition of this AUM also resulted in reductions in distribution and servicing expenses of $41.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011. We expect the amendments to result in an additional $6 billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next four months. 26Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance.AUM by Asset ClassAUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 was as follows: 2012 % ofTotal 2011 % ofTotal %Change Equity $163.4 26% $189.6 28% (14)%Fixed Income 356.1 55 356.6 53 Liquidity 123.8 19 131.4 19 (6)Total $643.3 100% $677.6 100% (5)%The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, were as follows: Equity FixedIncome Liquidity TotalMarch 31, 2011 $189.6 $356.6 $131.4 $677.6Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 21.7 25.2 46.9Redemptions (30.4) (20.7) (51.1)Separate account flows, net (12.6) (23.1) (0.2) (35.9)Liquidity fund flows, net 12.6 12.6Net client cash flows (21.3) (18.6) 12.4 (27.5)Market performance and other (2.1) 19.3 (0.1) 17.1Dispositions (2.8) (1.2) (19.9) (23.9)March 31, 2012 $163.4 $356.1 $123.8 $643.3Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2012 % ofTotal 2011 % ofTotal %ChangeEquity $168.4 26% $173.8 26% (3)%Fixed Income 359.8 56 361.6 54 Liquidity 116.6 18 133.8 20 (13)Total $644.8 100% $669.2 100% (4)%Investment Performance(1) Overall investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2012, was generally positive compared to relevant benchmarks.The equity markets ended a difficult year on a positive note, responding favorably to improving unemployment figures, the conclusion of bank stress tests resulting in certain banks increasing dividends, and reduced fears of a European debt fallout. As a result, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year. The most notable was the NASDAQ Composite returning 11.2% for the year ended March 31, 2012.In the fixed income markets, improved economic data suggested that the recovery was strengthening. Flights to safety ebbed as the European debt crisis eased allowing U.S. Treasury rates to climb from historically low levels. The yield curve steepened over the year as economic releases from the Federal Reserve Board painted an increasingly optimistic picture and talk of a third round of quantitative easing diminished. 27The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was high yield bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Index returning 6.5%. The best performing fixed income sector for the year was Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index returning 12.2% as of March 31, 2012.The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2012 As of March 31, 2011 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal (includes liquidity) 60% 80% 69% 86% 75% 78% 74% 84%Equity 48% 47% 66% 80% 42% 57% 61% 77%Fixed income 49% 87% 58% 83% 82% 80% 70% 81%The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category averages as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2012 As of March 31, 2011 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal long term (excludes liquidity) 67% 66% 78% 74% 56% 74% 70% 67%Equity 57% 56% 73% 71% 58% 70% 68% 60%Fixed income 84% 81% 87% 83% 52% 83% 78% 85%(1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.(2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in their marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, 91% and 89% of our equity assets under management and 88% and 89% of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites.(3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 18% and 17%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites.Business Model Streamlining InitiativeIn May 2010, we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that primarilyinvolved transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships. The initiative resulted in over $140 million in cost savings, which will be fully realized on an annual basis, beginning in fiscal 2013. These cost savings consist of (i) over $80 million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates, and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements; (ii) approximately $50 million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units, including savings associated with consolidating office space; and (iii) approximately $10 million from our global distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements.The initiative involved $127.5 million in transition related costs that primarily included charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period. The transition related costs also included charges for consolidating leased office space, early contract terminations, accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, asset disposals and professional fees. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, transition related costs totaled $73.1 million and $54.4 million, respectively. All transition related costs have been accrued as of March 31, 2012. Significant events of fiscal 2012 related to the initiative included the transition of shared services to our affiliates, as well as reductions in force made over three phases. For the year ended March 31, 2012, we have achieved total estimated transition related savings of approximately $97 million, and we expect total annual savings of approximately $140 million beginning in fiscal 2013, when compared to similar expenses prior to the commencement of the streamlining initiative. A majority of the estimated transition related savings were first achieved in fiscal 2012, and are noted, where applicable, in the results of operations discussion to follow. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative. 28RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity ("CLO"). The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non operating income (expense), is reflected in our Net Income, net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the consolidation of investment vehicles is presented below in our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles" (See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information). Also, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles.Operating RevenuesTotal operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2012, were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 4.4% from $2.8 billion in the prior year, primarily due to a 4% decrease in average AUM and a $47.2 million decrease in performance fees. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in average AUM revenue yields, from 34.4 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2011, to 35.2 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2012, resulting from a more favorable average asset mix. The previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship resulted in a reduction in operating revenues of $52.3 million, net of related fee waivers, in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition.Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $40.1 million, or 4.9%, to $775.5 million. Of this decrease, $25.9 million was primarily the result of lower average equity assets managed by LMCM, Batterymarch, ClearBridge and Legg Mason Investment Counsel & Trust Company ("LMIC"), and $8.0 million was primarily due to the divestiture of a Singapore based asset manager in fiscal 2011. These decreases were offset in part by an increase of $6.7 million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine Global Management, LLC ("Brandywine").Investment advisory fees from funds remained essentially flat at $1.5 billion for both periods. Higher average equity assets managed by Royce and ClearBridge, and higher average fixed income assets, primarily managed at Western Asset, resulted in an increase of $41.3 million and $41.1 million, respectively. These increases were offset by a decrease of $51.3 million, net of related fee waivers, due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset, primarily as a result of the previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to our MSSB relationship, as well as a $31.5 million decrease as a result of lower average equity assets managed by LMCM and Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal").Performance fees decreased 48.8%, or $47.2 million, to $49.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2012, primarily as a result of lower fees earned on assets managed at Permal and Western Asset, offset slightly by an increase in performance fees earned on assets managed at Brandywine. Distribution and service fees decreased $38.2 million, or 10.1%, to $341.0 million, primarily due to the disposition of the liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship, as well as a decline in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and service fees.Operating ExpensesTotal compensation and benefits decreased $41.0 million to $1.1 billion. Transition related compensation decreased $10.4 million to $34.6 million, and represents accruals for severance and retention costs related to our business streamlining initiative. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation, decreased $30.6 million, or 2.7%, to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by a $49.8 million decrease in corporate compensation, primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our business streamlining initiative, as well as a $43.2 million net decrease in compensation at revenue share based affiliates. Additionally, there was a decrease in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $22.5 million, primarily resulting from reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by corresponding decreases in Other non operating income (expense). These decreases were offset in part by an increase in incentives from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset, including an increase in non cash amortization expense associated with certain related deferred compensation awards, totaling $71.8 million, as well as additional costs of approximately $20.5 million associated with market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees, primarily in our global distribution group, to support on going growth initiatives.Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 43.0% from 42.6% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the impact of the change in the expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset and market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees, discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of lower corporate compensation costs, primarily attributable to our business streamlining initiative, the impact of compensation decreases related 29to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, and the decrease in transition related compensation.Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 8.9% to $649.7 million, principally driven by a $41.4 million decrease due to the previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship, as well as a $6.9 million decrease in servicing expenses as a result of our business streamlining initiative. A $5.8 million decline in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches also contributed to the decrease.Communications and technology expense increased 1.7% to $164.7 million, driven by increases, principally in data processing costs, market data costs, and consulting fees, totaling $12.2 million, primarily due to transition related costs incurred as a result of our business streamlining initiative. These increases were offset in part by $9.3 million in cost savings as a result of our streamlining changes, including reduced depreciation of technology hardware and software and consulting fees.Occupancy expense increased 12.3% to $154.8 million, primarily due to a $14.7 million net increase in lease reserves recorded in fiscal 2012, primarily related to permanently abandoning certain office space as part of our business streamlining initiative. In addition, there was a $10.3 million increase as a result of the acceleration of depreciation related to space permanently abandoned in fiscal 2012, also related to our business streamlining initiative. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the write off of a $4.1 million real estate escrow deposit in the prior year and a $3.3 million reduction in depreciation on furniture and leasehold improvements, both resulting from our business streamlining initiative.Amortization of intangibles decreased 14.6% to $19.6 million, primarily due to the full amortization of certain management contracts during fiscal 2012.Other expenses increased $14.1 million, or 8.0%, to $190.7 million, primarily as a result of an increase in expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds during the current year under expense cap arrangements.Non Operating Income (Expense)Interest income increased 24.2% to $11.5 million, driven by higher yields earned on investment balances.Interest expense decreased 5.0% to $87.6 million, primarily as a result of the retirement of our Equity Units during fiscal 2012, which reduced interest expense by $4.1 million.Other non operating income decreased $37.5 million to $22.1 million, primarily as a result of $56.0 million in net market losses on investments in proprietary fund products, which were partially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and $11.8 million due to reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases described above. These decreases were offset in part by an $11.3 million increase in dividend income, which was partially offset by a corresponding compensation increase under revenue sharing agreements, a gain of $8.6 million related to an assigned bankruptcy claim, and a gain of $7.5 million on the sale of a small affiliate.Other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles ("CIVs") increased $16.6 million to $18.3 million, due to net market gains on investments of certain CIVs.Income Tax ProvisionThe provision for income taxes was $72.1 million compared to $119.4 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2012, The U.K. Finance Act 2011 (the "Act") was enacted. The Act reduced the main U.K. corporate income tax rate from 27% to 26% effective April 1, 2011, and to 25% effective April 1, 2012. The impact of the tax rate changes on the revaluation of certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $18.3 million in the current year. The prior year also included a similar tax benefit of $8.9 million on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the restructuring of our Australian business, partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets, resulted in a net tax benefit of $10.1 million in the current year. The effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 32.7% in the prior year. Changes in the U.K. tax rate impacted the effective tax rate by 6.0 and 2.5 percentage points in the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, the restructuring of our Australian business, partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets, impacted the effective tax rate by 3.3 percentage points in the current year. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial InformationAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles, "Adjusted Income", and "Operating Margin, As Adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period to period operating performance. 30Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment VehiclesIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a CLO. In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles," we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs.We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the CIVs from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees we earn from CIVs are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly, the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs are removed from the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to us. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non GAAP basis of other companies.The following table presents a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVsTotal operating revenues $2,662,574 $3,094 $2,665,668 $2,784,317$4,133$2,788,450Total operating expenses 2,323,821 (608) 2,323,213 2,397,509(571)2,396,938Operating Income 338,753 3,702 342,455 386,8084,704391,512Other non operating income (expense) (35,670) (13,566) (49,236) (21,611)3,680(17,931)Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 303,083 (9,864) 293,219 365,1978,384373,581Income tax provision 72,052 72,052 119,434119,434Net Income (Loss) 231,031 (9,864) 221,167 245,7638,384254,147Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 10,214 (9,864) 350 (8,160)8,384224Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $220,817 $ $220,817 $253,923$$253,923Adjusted IncomeWe define "Adjusted Income" as Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets, and net money market fund support losses (gains).We believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business.Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, 31is most readily reconcilable to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., but is not a substitute for Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider Adjusted Income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, engaged in significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions.In calculating Adjusted Income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carryforward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and United Kingdom tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets, if applicable, that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle ("SIV") securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments.Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on Adjusted Income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $220,817 $253,923Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 19,574 22,913Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 135,830 134,602U.K. tax rate adjustment (18,268) (8,878)Imputed interest on convertible debt 39,077 36,688Adjusted Income $397,030 $439,248Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $1.54 $1.63Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.15Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.95 0.87U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.13) (0.06)Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.27 0.24Adjusted Income per diluted share $2.77 $2.83 32Operating Margin, as AdjustedWe calculate "Operating Margin, as Adjusted," by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of CIVs, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "Operating Revenues, as Adjusted." The compensation items, other than transition related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Transition related costs and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use Operating Revenues, as Adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Operating Revenues, as Adjusted, also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.We believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins of other companies.The calculation of Operating margin and Operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $2,662,574 $2,784,317Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 3,094 4,133Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (649,679) (712,779)Operating Revenues, as Adjusted $2,015,989 $2,075,671 Operating Income, GAAP basis $338,753 $386,808Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 13,809 36,274Transition related costs 73,066 54,434Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 3,702 4,704Operating Income, as Adjusted $429,330 $482,220 Operating margin, GAAP basis 12.7% 13.9%Operating margin, as adjusted 21.3 23.2 33FISCAL 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2010Financial OverviewNet income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2011, totaled $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase in Net Income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues, reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees, reduced interest expense, and a change in the U.K. tax rate. These increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation, the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year, and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Net Income, as previously discussed, excluding the impact of the current year U.K. tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year. Operating margin increased to 13.9% from 12.2% in the prior year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) increased to 23.2% from 20.7% in the prior year.Assets Under ManagementThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 2010Beginning of period $684.5 $632.4Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds (1) Subscriptions 49.5 38.8Redemptions (44.3) (40.2)Separate account flows, net (52.1) (76.5)Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2) (4.1)Net client cash flows (61.1) (82.0)Market performance and other (2) 56.3 134.1Dispositions (2.1) End of period $677.6 $684.5 (1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes.

The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $61 billion, which were partially offset by market appreciation of $56 billion, of which approximately 17% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, and dispositions of $2 billion, relating to the sale of a Singapore based Asian equity manager. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $37 billion, or 61% of the outflows, followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of $16 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge and LMCM, while Permal and Royce had net inflows.

Despite these global concerns, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions activity.In the fixed income markets, relatively strong economic data, combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise across the yield curve.The yield curve slightly flattened over the year as the Federal Reserve kept its funds rate at 0.25% and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period. The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond Index returning 4.28%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Bond Index, which returned 14.31% followed by U.S. TIPS, as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which returned 7.91% for the year.The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal (includes liquidity) 75% 78% 74% 84% 81% 60% 67% 91%Equity 42% 57% 61% 77% 49% 61% 72% 86%Fixed income 82% 80% 70% 81% 88% 40% 50% 88% 35The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal long term (excludes liquidity) 56% 74% 70% 67% 62% 68% 70% 80%Equity 58% 70% 68% 60% 51% 63% 65% 78%Fixed income 52% 83% 78% 85% 81% 78% 83% 87% (1) Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.

As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOperating RevenuesTotal operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2011, were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from $2.6 billion in the prior year, despite a 1% decrease in average AUM, reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees. These increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors.Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at $815.6 million, as a decrease of $25.4 million, resulting from lower average fixed income assets at Western Asset, was offset by an $18.6 million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by Batterymarch and Royce, a $5.1 million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine, and a $2.2 million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain CLOs managed by Western Asset.Investment advisory fees from funds increased $119.3 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion. Of this increase, $111.5 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at Royce, Permal, and ClearBridge, and $84.4 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset and a $36.0 million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset, primarily to maintain certain yields to investors.Performance fees increased 35%, or $25.2 million, to $96.7 million during fiscal 2011, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine.Distribution and service fees increased 1% to $379.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset.Operating ExpensesTotal compensation and benefits increased $74.1 million to $1.2 billion. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation of $45.0 million, which represents severance and retention incentive costs, increased $29.0 million, or 3%, to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by a $68.6 million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal 2011, and a $7.5 million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are recorded in Other non operating income (expense), as well as, a $6.1 million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates. The impact of reduced headcount, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives, also reduced compensation and benefits by $6.0 million. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.6% from 42.2% in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation, and transition related compensation. These increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues.Distribution and servicing expenses increased 3% to $712.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of $14.5 million in structuring fees related to closed 36end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors.Communications and technology expense decreased 1% to $162.0 million, of which $9.2 million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2011, offset in part by a $6.6 million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives.Occupancy expense decreased 12% to $137.9 million, primarily due to the impact of a $19.3 million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010.Amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at $22.9 million.Other expenses increased $8.9 million to $176.6 million, primarily as a result of a $10.3 million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs, a $5.6 million increase in state franchise taxes, a $4.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $5.4 million increase in charges related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These increases were offset in part by the impact of a $19.0 million investor settlement in the prior year.Non Operating Income (Expense)Interest income increased 26% to $9.2 million driven by higher average interest rates, offset in part by a $0.9 million decrease due to lower average investment balances.Interest expense decreased 27% to $92.2 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009 and the repayment of the $550 million outstanding term loan balance in January 2010, which reduced interest expense by $14.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively.As of March 31, 2010, all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms. Fund support gains were $23.2 million in the prior year. The gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds.Other non operating income (expense) decreased $27.3 million, primarily as a result of a $46.7 million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and a $4.3 million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of our Equity Units in the prior year.Other non operating income (expense) of CIVs decreased $15.6 million, to a gain of $1.7 million, due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a CIV.Income Tax ProvisionThe provision for income taxes was $119.4 million compared to $118.7 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2011, the U.K. Finance (No. 2) Act of 2010 was enacted, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 27% for periods beginning after April 1, 2011. The impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million.The effective tax rate was 32.7% compared to 36.0% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the U.K. tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes. In addition, the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions. 37Supplemental Non GAAP Financial InformationConsolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment VehiclesThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVsTotal operating revenues $2,784,317$4,133$2,788,450 $2,634,879 $2,779 $2,637,658Total operating expenses 2,397,509(571)2,396,938 2,313,696 680 2,314,376Operating Income 386,8084,704391,512 321,183 2,099 323,282Other non operating income (expense) (21,611)3,680(17,931) 8,473 (8,520) (47)Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 365,1978,384373,581 329,656 (6,421) 323,235Income tax provision 119,434119,434 118,676 118,676Net Income (Loss) 245,7638,384254,147 210,980 (6,421) 204,559Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (8,160)8,384224 6,623 (6,421) 202Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $253,923$$253,923 $204,357 $ $204,357 38Adjusted IncomeA reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $253,923 $204,357Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,913 22,769Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 134,602 136,252U.K. tax rate adjustment (8,878) Imputed interest on convertible debt 36,688 34,445Net money market fund support gains (1) (16,565)Adjusted Income $439,248 $381,258Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $1.63 $1.32Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.15 0.14Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.87 0.88U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.06) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.24 0.22Net money market fund support gains (1) (0.11)Adjusted Income per diluted share $2.83 $2.45(1) Net of income taxes. 39Operating Margin, as AdjustedThe calculation of Operating margin and Operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $2,784,317 $2,634,879Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 4,133 2,779Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (712,779) (691,868)Operating Revenues, as Adjusted $2,075,671 $1,945,790 Operating Income, GAAP basis $386,808 $321,183Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 36,274 79,316Transition related costs 54,434 Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 4,704 2,099Operating Income, as Adjusted $482,220 $402,598 Operating margin, GAAP basis 13.9% 12.2%Operating margin, as adjusted 23.2 20.7Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe primary objective of our capital structure is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt.The consolidation of variable interest entities discussed above does not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations.Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of our operations. At March 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.4 billion, $8.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Total assets and total liabilities of the CIVs at March 31, 2012, were $354 million and $280 million, respectively. 40The following table summarizes our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2012 2011 2010Cash flows provided by operating activities $496.8 $412.1 $1,413.1Cash flows provided by/(used in) investing activities 2.3 (44.4) (276.7)Cash flows used in financing activities (481.8) (468.5) (746.7)Effect of exchange rate changes (10.9) 10.8 19.5Net change in cash and cash equivalents 6.4 (90.0) 409.2Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,375.9 1,465.9 1,056.7Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $1,382.3 $1,375.9 $1,465.9Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2012, were $496.8 million, primarily related to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash inflows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2012, were $2.3 million, primarily related to $20.2 million of net activity related to CIVs and a release of restricted cash required for market hedge arrangements, offset in part by payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2012, were $481.8 million, primarily due to the repurchase of 13.6 million shares of our common stock for $400.3 million and dividends paid of $43.6 million. There remains $155 million under the current Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock announced in May 2010, which we intend to utilize in fiscal 2013, subject to market conditions and our performance, actual cash flows, and other capital needs. Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 were $412.1 million, primarily attributable to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 were $44.4 million, primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 were $468.5 million, primarily attributable to the repurchase of 14.6 million of our common shares for $445 million. During fiscal 2010, cash inflows provided by operating activities were $1.4 billion, of which $1.0 billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks. The remainder was primarily attributable to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements. Cash outflows used in financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million five year term loan, $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the exchange offer for our outstanding Equity Units and the payment of cash dividends. Financing TransactionsThe table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2012: Totalat March 31, Amount Outstanding atMarch 31, Type 2012 2012 2011 Interest Rate Maturity2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $1,250,000 $1,127,009 $1,087,932 2.50% January 20155.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 5.60% Retired June 2011Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, of approximately $39.1 million, $36.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. 41In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consisted of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% Senior Notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. In June 2011, the $103.0 million of outstanding debt on the remaining 5.6% senior notes from Equity Units was retired, as part of a remarketing. Concurrently, we issued 1.8 million shares of Legg Mason common stock upon the exercise of the purchase contracts from Equity Units.During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. The facility matures on February 11, 2013.In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt.The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our gross debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5 to 1. As of March 31, 2012, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7 to 1, and thus the covenant prohibits us from borrowing additional amounts as of that date. The 2.5% convertible senior notes were extinguished in May 2012, as further described in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 1 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0 to 1. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $375 million. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, and any non cash charges, as defined. As of March 31, 2012, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 to 1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 13.8 to 1. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2012.If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments.Certain of our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. The interest rate on our revolving line of credit is based on the higher credit rating of the two rating agencies. In June 2011, our rating by one of these agencies was downgraded one notch below the other. Should the other agency downgrade our rating, absent an upgrade from the former agency, our interest costs will rise modestly.Other TransactionsDuring fiscal 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Permal, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares issued by Permal and held by Permals pre acquisition owners. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we paid an aggregate amount of $7.5 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill.In May 2010, we terminated the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In this transaction, 1.1 million shares, representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis.Certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. Certain affiliates are 42also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements during the periods presented.See Notes 6, 7 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our financing transactions.Liquidity Fund SupportDuring fiscal 2010, four capital support agreements to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder prior to termination and $42 million of collateral was returned.Future OutlookWe expect that over the next 12 months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. We currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, repayment of outstanding debt, payment of increased dividends, or acquisitions.During fiscal 2012, we completed the business model streamlining initiative that began in May 2010. We incurred transition related costs of approximately $128 million through March 31, 2012, of which approximately 25% were non cash charges. Approximately $80 million of these costs have been paid to date, and substantially all of the $16.8 million remaining costs represent lease obligations to be paid over the lease terms. The initiative resulted in annual cost savings of over $140 million, which will be fully realized on an annual basis, beginning in fiscal 2013. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal 2012 and 2011.As described above, we currently project that our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2012, we had over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to $155 million of our common stock during fiscal 2013, as previously discussed. We do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next 12 months, other than to refinance existing facilities. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events result in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt.At March 31, 2012, our total cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion included $600 million held by foreign subsidiaries. Some of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to material repatriation tax effects. In a prior year, we initiated plans to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million, of which approximately $100 million had been repatriated as of March 31, 2012. Under current plans, we intend to repatriate $100 million to $150 million of foreign earnings in order to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized and to make the cash available in the U.S. All amounts planned for repatriation have been adequately provided for. No further repatriation of accumulated prior period foreign earnings beyond the above range is currently planned. However, we may repatriate future earnings to the extent required to fund domestic operations and, if tax has not previously been provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriation of these funds. It is not practical at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result from any further repatriation of foreign earnings beyond that currently planned. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for subsequent events related to our new capital plan, including $650 million issuance of 5.5% senior notes and $1.25 billion repayment of 2.5% convertible senior notes.Credit and Liquidity RiskCash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity 43or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and Contingent PaymentsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our short and long term debt, non cancelable lease agreements, and service agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments.The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year, and excludes contractual obligations of CIVs, as we are not responsible or liable for these obligations: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter TotalContractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $250.0Long term borrowings by contract maturity(2) 1.3 1.3 1,251.4 5.9 1,259.9Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2)(3) 38.1 31.7 31.6 0.3 101.7Minimum rental and service commitments 148.2 118.1 107.9 96.4 87.7 489.3 1,047.6Total Contractual Obligations(4)(5)(6) $437.6 $151.1 $1,390.9 $102.6 $87.7 $489.3 $2,659.2(1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose.(2)Excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated CLO of $271.7 million and interest on these long term borrowings, as applicable. (3)Interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2012.(4)The table above does not include approximately $36.7 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal 2018.(5)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $69.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities), because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated.(6)The table above does not include redeemable noncontrolling interests of $24.0 million, because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated.MARKET RISKWe maintain an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk.Revenues and Net IncomeThe majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM, and thus our revenues, to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business, we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. 44Trading and Non Trading AssetsOur trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products.Trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2012 2011Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $111,257 $120,107Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 222,585 204,063Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 78,277 76,340Total current investments, excluding CIVs $412,119 $400,510Approximately $80.0 million and $96.0 million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading and other current investments of $86.2 million and $72.6 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income (expense) and net income.Approximately $245.9 million and $231.9 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $12.6 million and $30.9 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $11.8 million and $39.8 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy.Non trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2012 2011Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Available for sale $11,913 $11,300Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other 34,965 22,167Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs 169,201 155,351Other investments 112 270Total non trading assets, excluding CIVs $216,191 $189,088Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2012 and 2011, includes approximately $89.3 million and $91.9 million, respectively, of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program. Fluctuations in the market value of these investments have offsetting compensation expense under revenue sharing agreements.Investment securities of CIVs totaled $31.6 million and $82.8 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and investments of CIVs totaled $294.9 million and $312.8 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we held equity investments in the CIVs of $38.9 million and $53.7 million, respectively. Fluctuations in the market value of investments of CIVs in excess of our equity investment will not impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. However, it may have an impact on other non operating income (expense) of CIVs with a corresponding offset in net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." See Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion 45of derivatives.The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2012: Carrying Value Fair ValueAssuming a20% Increase(1) Fair ValueAssuming a20% Decrease(1)Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $111,257 $133,508 $89,006Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 222,585 267,102 178,068Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 78,277 93,932 62,622Total current investments, excluding CIVs 412,119 494,542 329,696Investments in CIVs 38,919 46,703 31,135Available for sale investments 11,913 14,296 9,530Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other 34,965 41,958 27,972Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs 169,201 203,041 135,361Other investments 112 134 90Total investments subject to market risk $667,229 $800,674 $533,784(1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $11.8 million have been economically hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $81.5 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of March 31, 2012.Foreign Exchange SensitivityWe operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Poland, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity.Interest Rate RiskExposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as substantially all of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $250.0 million of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2012, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESAccounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments.ConsolidationEffective April 1, 2010, we adopted revised accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, "Consolidation," (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R)") ("SFAS No. 167"), relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") which includes a 46new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE, changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE, and changes in the assessment of which entities are VIEs. The application of the revised accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds, including money market funds. Investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46(R)").In the normal course of our business, we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles. Certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be VIEs while others are considered to be voting rights entities ("VREs") subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were not material at March 31, 2012. We have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these VIEs, VREs or their investors. Investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle.Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) (Accounting Standards Update 2010 10, "Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds")For most sponsored investment funds, including money market funds, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker if certain criteria are met. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary.Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167 (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, "Consolidation")We sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities ("CDOs") and CLOs that do not qualify for the deferral, and are assessed under the revised accounting guidance, as follows. We determine whether we have a variable interest in a VIE by considering if, among other things, we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that are expected to be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return. If we have a significant variable interest, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that potentially could be significant to the VIE.In evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is more than insignificant.Legg Mason must consolidate VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs.Revenue RecognitionThe vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith.For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a 47combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition.As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian.Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2012, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $163.4 billion, $356.1 billion and $123.8 billion, respectively.As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2012, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs.Valuation of Financial InstrumentsSubstantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except our long term debt. Trading investments, investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.For equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investees net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non operating income (expense).For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined.For investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, excluding 48investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $11.9 million and $23.8 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs.At March 31, 2012 and 2011, we also have approximately $204.2 million and $177.5 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $169.2 million and $155.4 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is accounted for under the cost method, which considers if factors indicate there may be an impairment in the value of these investments. In addition, as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $78.3 million and $76.3 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets.Level 2 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. This category also includes CLO loans and liabilities of a CIV, and previously included certain derivative assets and liabilities of CIVs.Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes investments in partnerships, limited liability companies and private equity funds. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and CLO debt of a CIV.The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.Proprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at net asset value ("NAV") determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3.The fair values of CLO loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as Level 2. Legg Mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. The fair value of CLO debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the CLOs underlying collateral assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement, the CLO debt valuation is classified as Level 3.Exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale, the last offering price. Options traded over 49the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations. Options are classified as Level 1. Futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps previously held were valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and classified as Level 2.As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date.As of March 31, 2012, approximately 3% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 10% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 2% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3.Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period.See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Intangible Assets and GoodwillBalances as of March 31, 2012, are as follows:Amortizable asset management contracts $33,437Indefinite life intangible assets 3,753,629Trade names 69,800Goodwill 1,275,045 $5,131,911Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below.For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, internal budgets, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions.Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities.Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. 50We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2011, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of that date. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2012, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2012, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary.Amortizable Intangible AssetsIntangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to five years with a weighted average life of approximately 2.9 years.Indefinite Life Intangible AssetsFor intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names.We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary.Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million account for approximately 65% of our indefinite life intangible assets and are managed primarily by ClearBridge and Western Asset. Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 25% of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2011, annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 7%. Cash flows on the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 9%. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 13.0% and 14.5%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 5% and 35%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 13.5% and 19.5%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. Given the current uncertainty regarding future market conditions, it is reasonably possible that fund performance, flows and AUM levels may decrease in the near term such that actual cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts could deviate from the projections by more than 5% and the asset could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $124 million and $606 million, respectively.Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts, and the resulting fair values significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts. 51GoodwillGoodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team, which during fiscal 2012, resulted in the combination of our Americas and International divisions into one operating segment, Global Asset Management. Internal management reporting has been modified consistent with this realignment such that discrete financial information regularly received by the chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, is at the consolidated Global Asset Management business level. As a result, the former Americas and International operating segments are no longer our reporting units, and subsequently, goodwill is recorded and evaluated at one Global Asset Management reporting unit level. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments.Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) and by investment manager based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values.Goodwill principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM, Permal and Royce. The value of the reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our managers. For our annual December 31 impairment test, the projected cash flows are discounted at 14.0% to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2011, the implied fair value significantly exceeds the carrying value. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes, are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 8%. Cash flow growth is based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections are based on long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business, available historical experience and market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate approximately 51% from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately eight percentage points for goodwill to be considered for impairment.As of December 31, 2011, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting unit.Stock Based CompensationOur stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees.In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Also, under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows.We granted 0.8 million, 0.7 million, and 1.5 million stock options in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 52We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we would use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different.Income TaxesWe are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes.These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision.Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and U.K. taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2012, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $718 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.1 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $169 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to $10.4 million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance of $3.4 million was recorded in fiscal 2012 with respect thereto. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2012, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $237 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $12.1 million for fiscal 2012. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. A net release of $7.3 million in fiscal 2012 of the full valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets related to various jurisdictions, primarily the U.K. and Japan. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSSee discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSWe have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and 53statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, including expected earnings per share in future periods, anticipated future investment performance of our affiliates, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance.Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of our AUM; the mix of our AUM among our affiliates; the revenue yield of our AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products both in absolute terms and relative to competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions.Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations.EFFECTS OF INFLATIONThe rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(4)Calculated based on total debt as a percentage of total capital (total stockholders equity plus total debt) as of March 31. 22ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWLegg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America ("U.S.") and the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. All references to fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010, refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason.In connection with a realignment of our executive management team during fiscal 2011, we no longer manage our business in two divisions and, during fiscal 2012, eliminated the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions and combined them into one operating segment, Global Asset Management. We believe this structure allows us to function as a global organization with a single purpose. As a result of this change, we no longer present assets under management ("AUM") or revenues by division.Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our AUM and fee rates, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain AUM and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our AUM primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions.The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, the asset management affiliate that provides the services, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our AUM. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one affiliate can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate. In addition, from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability.The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels, non compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share based affiliates, and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity.Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but also in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our AUM, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key 23employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the last few years, the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share. In addition, the economic downturn of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contributed to a significant contraction in our business and we have not recovered to pre downturn levels. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, and in prior years, by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions.The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability.Our strategy is focused on three primary areas listed below. Management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition. Consistent with this approach, we have also listed below the most important matters on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition.Outstanding independent investment managers:The investment performance of our asset management products and services compared to their benchmarks and to the performance of competitive products for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods.Our AUM, the components of the changes in our AUM amid continued market uncertainty, the long term trend of outflows in AUM, and the resulting impact of changes in AUM on our revenues.A corporate center that delivers strategic value:Promote revenue growth through strategic marketing of products to institutional clients, supported by retail and instividual (e.g., 401(k) plans) distribution globally.Management of expenses.Allocating capital for diversified growth and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate:The amount of excess capital we generate, and deployment of that capital through share repurchases, investments in proprietary fund products, dividends and targeted acquisitions.The following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAlthough the financial environment, both globally and in the U.S., continued to rebound during fiscal 2012, challenging and volatile conditions persisted throughout a portion of our fiscal year. Economic uncertainties related to the European debt crisis slowed the global economy, and the unprecedented downgrade to the U.S. credit rating in August 2011 contributed to a sharp decline in the equity markets during the first half of fiscal 2012. In spite of the challenging conditions during the first half of our fiscal year, economic interventions which eased the European debt crisis, and continuing improvement in U.S. employment rates and consumer confidence, resulted in equity market increases during the second half of the fiscal year which more than offset earlier market declines. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve Board held the federal funds rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. While the economic outlook has been more positive than in recent years, the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging, as we move into fiscal 2013.All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below: % Change as of and for the year ended March 31:Indices(1) 2012 2011Dow Jones Industrial Average 7.24% 13.48%S&P 500 6.23% 13.37%NASDAQ Composite Index 11.16% 15.98%Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 7.71% 5.12%Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index 5.26% 7.15%(1)Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. 24The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change(1) Years EndedMarch 31, 2012Compared 2011Compared 2012 2011 2010 to 2011 to 2010Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 29.1% 29.3% 30.9% (4.9)% 0.1%Funds 56.0 53.4 51.9 0.3 8.7Performance fees 1.9 3.5 2.7 (48.8) 35.3Distribution and service fees 12.8 13.6 14.3 (10.1) 1.0Other 0.2 0.2 0.2 (16.0) 4.6Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 (4.4) 5.7Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 41.7 41.0 42.2 (2.7) 2.6Transition related compensation 1.3 1.6 (23.1) n/m Total compensation and benefits 43.0 42.6 42.2 (3.5) 6.7Distribution and servicing 24.4 25.6 26.3 (8.9) 3.0Communications and technology 6.2 5.8 6.2 1.7 (0.7)Occupancy 5.8 5.0 6.0 12.3 (12.2)Amortization of intangible assets 0.7 0.8 0.8 (14.6) 0.6Other 7.2 6.3 6.3 8.0 5.3Total operating expenses 87.3 86.1 87.8 (3.1) 3.6Operating Income 12.7 13.9 12.2 (12.4) 20.4Other Income (Expense) Interest income 0.4 0.3 0.3 24.2 25.7Interest expense (3.3) (3.3) (4.8) (5.0) (27.0)Fund support 0.9 n/m n/mOther 0.8 2.1 3.2 (62.9) (31.4)Other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles 0.8 0.1 0.7 (65.1) (90.2)Total other income (expense) (1.3) (0.8) 0.3 n/m n/mIncome before Income Tax Provision 11.4 13.1 12.5 (17.0) 10.8Income tax provision 2.7 4.3 4.5 (39.7) 0.6Net Income 8.7 8.8 8.0 (6.0) 16.5Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 (0.3) 0.2 n/m n/mNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. 8.3% 9.1% 7.8% (13.0)% 24.3%n/m not meaningful(1) Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 25FISCAL 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2011Financial OverviewNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2012, totaled $220.8 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in the prior year. The decrease in Net Income was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset"), the impact of net market losses on proprietary fund products and assets invested for deferred compensation plans which are not offset in compensation and benefits, and the net impact of decreased operating revenues. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of cost savings due to our business streamlining initiative, and the impact of tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary and U.K. tax rate changes. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to $397.0 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2012, from $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in Net Income, previously discussed, excluding the impact of U.K. tax rate adjustments. Operating margin decreased to 12.7% from 13.9% in the prior year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, was 21.3% and 23.2%, respectively.Assets Under ManagementThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31, were as follows: 2012 2011Beginning of period $677.6 $684.5Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 46.9 49.5Redemptions (51.1) (44.3)Separate account flows, net (35.9) (52.1)Liquidity fund flows, net 12.6 (14.2)Net client cash flows (27.5) (61.1)Market performance and other (2) 17.1 56.3Dispositions (23.9) (2.1)End of period $643.3 $677.6(1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2) Includes impact of foreign exchange, reinvestment of dividends, and other. AUM at March 31, 2012, was $643.3 billion, a decrease of $34.3 billion, or 5%, from March 31, 2011. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $27.5 billion and dispositions of $23.9 billion, which were partially offset by market performance and other of $17.1 billion, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The majority of dispositions were in liquidity assets, $19.9 billion, which resulted from the amendment of historical Smith Barney brokerage programs discussed below. There were also $4.0 billion in dispositions from the divestiture of two small affiliates. Long term asset classes accounted for the net client outflows, with $21.3 billion and $18.6 billion in equity and fixed income outflows, respectively, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $12.4 billion. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"), ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. (Batterymarch) and Royce & Associates (Royce). Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net annual outflows in our equity asset class since fiscal 2007. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset, including $12.7 billion in outflows from a single, low fee global sovereign mandate. We expect to continue to experience outflows from this mandate of approximately $1 billion per month during fiscal 2013. With the exception of the June 2011 quarter, we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and Net Income than would outflows in other asset classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ("MSSB") amended certain historical Smith Barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage that resulted in a reduction of $19.9 billion in liquidity AUM during the year ended March 31, 2012. As a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition, the disposition of this liquidity AUM resulted in a reduction in operating revenue of $52.3 million, net of related fee waivers, in the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011. The disposition of this AUM also resulted in reductions in distribution and servicing expenses of $41.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011. We expect the amendments to result in an additional $6 billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next four months. 26Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance.AUM by Asset ClassAUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 was as follows: 2012 % ofTotal 2011 % ofTotal %Change Equity $163.4 26% $189.6 28% (14)%Fixed Income 356.1 55 356.6 53 Liquidity 123.8 19 131.4 19 (6)Total $643.3 100% $677.6 100% (5)%The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, were as follows: Equity FixedIncome Liquidity TotalMarch 31, 2011 $189.6 $356.6 $131.4 $677.6Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 21.7 25.2 46.9Redemptions (30.4) (20.7) (51.1)Separate account flows, net (12.6) (23.1) (0.2) (35.9)Liquidity fund flows, net 12.6 12.6Net client cash flows (21.3) (18.6) 12.4 (27.5)Market performance and other (2.1) 19.3 (0.1) 17.1Dispositions (2.8) (1.2) (19.9) (23.9)March 31, 2012 $163.4 $356.1 $123.8 $643.3Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2012 % ofTotal 2011 % ofTotal %ChangeEquity $168.4 26% $173.8 26% (3)%Fixed Income 359.8 56 361.6 54 Liquidity 116.6 18 133.8 20 (13)Total $644.8 100% $669.2 100% (4)%Investment Performance(1) Overall investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2012, was generally positive compared to relevant benchmarks.The equity markets ended a difficult year on a positive note, responding favorably to improving unemployment figures, the conclusion of bank stress tests resulting in certain banks increasing dividends, and reduced fears of a European debt fallout. As a result, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year. The most notable was the NASDAQ Composite returning 11.2% for the year ended March 31, 2012.In the fixed income markets, improved economic data suggested that the recovery was strengthening. Flights to safety ebbed as the European debt crisis eased allowing U.S. Treasury rates to climb from historically low levels. The yield curve steepened over the year as economic releases from the Federal Reserve Board painted an increasingly optimistic picture and talk of a third round of quantitative easing diminished. 27The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was high yield bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Index returning 6.5%. The best performing fixed income sector for the year was Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index returning 12.2% as of March 31, 2012.The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2012 As of March 31, 2011 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal (includes liquidity) 60% 80% 69% 86% 75% 78% 74% 84%Equity 48% 47% 66% 80% 42% 57% 61% 77%Fixed income 49% 87% 58% 83% 82% 80% 70% 81%The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category averages as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2012 As of March 31, 2011 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal long term (excludes liquidity) 67% 66% 78% 74% 56% 74% 70% 67%Equity 57% 56% 73% 71% 58% 70% 68% 60%Fixed income 84% 81% 87% 83% 52% 83% 78% 85%(1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.(2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in their marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, 91% and 89% of our equity assets under management and 88% and 89% of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites.(3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 18% and 17%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites.Business Model Streamlining InitiativeIn May 2010, we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that primarilyinvolved transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships. The initiative resulted in over $140 million in cost savings, which will be fully realized on an annual basis, beginning in fiscal 2013. These cost savings consist of (i) over $80 million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates, and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements; (ii) approximately $50 million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units, including savings associated with consolidating office space; and (iii) approximately $10 million from our global distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements.The initiative involved $127.5 million in transition related costs that primarily included charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period. The transition related costs also included charges for consolidating leased office space, early contract terminations, accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, asset disposals and professional fees. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, transition related costs totaled $73.1 million and $54.4 million, respectively. All transition related costs have been accrued as of March 31, 2012. Significant events of fiscal 2012 related to the initiative included the transition of shared services to our affiliates, as well as reductions in force made over three phases. For the year ended March 31, 2012, we have achieved total estimated transition related savings of approximately $97 million, and we expect total annual savings of approximately $140 million beginning in fiscal 2013, when compared to similar expenses prior to the commencement of the streamlining initiative. A majority of the estimated transition related savings were first achieved in fiscal 2012, and are noted, where applicable, in the results of operations discussion to follow. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative. 28RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity ("CLO"). The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non operating income (expense), is reflected in our Net Income, net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the consolidation of investment vehicles is presented below in our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles" (See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information). Also, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles.Operating RevenuesTotal operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2012, were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 4.4% from $2.8 billion in the prior year, primarily due to a 4% decrease in average AUM and a $47.2 million decrease in performance fees. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in average AUM revenue yields, from 34.4 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2011, to 35.2 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2012, resulting from a more favorable average asset mix. The previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship resulted in a reduction in operating revenues of $52.3 million, net of related fee waivers, in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition.Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $40.1 million, or 4.9%, to $775.5 million. Of this decrease, $25.9 million was primarily the result of lower average equity assets managed by LMCM, Batterymarch, ClearBridge and Legg Mason Investment Counsel & Trust Company ("LMIC"), and $8.0 million was primarily due to the divestiture of a Singapore based asset manager in fiscal 2011. These decreases were offset in part by an increase of $6.7 million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine Global Management, LLC ("Brandywine").Investment advisory fees from funds remained essentially flat at $1.5 billion for both periods. Higher average equity assets managed by Royce and ClearBridge, and higher average fixed income assets, primarily managed at Western Asset, resulted in an increase of $41.3 million and $41.1 million, respectively. These increases were offset by a decrease of $51.3 million, net of related fee waivers, due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset, primarily as a result of the previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to our MSSB relationship, as well as a $31.5 million decrease as a result of lower average equity assets managed by LMCM and Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal").Performance fees decreased 48.8%, or $47.2 million, to $49.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2012, primarily as a result of lower fees earned on assets managed at Permal and Western Asset, offset slightly by an increase in performance fees earned on assets managed at Brandywine. Distribution and service fees decreased $38.2 million, or 10.1%, to $341.0 million, primarily due to the disposition of the liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship, as well as a decline in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and service fees.Operating ExpensesTotal compensation and benefits decreased $41.0 million to $1.1 billion. Transition related compensation decreased $10.4 million to $34.6 million, and represents accruals for severance and retention costs related to our business streamlining initiative. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation, decreased $30.6 million, or 2.7%, to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by a $49.8 million decrease in corporate compensation, primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our business streamlining initiative, as well as a $43.2 million net decrease in compensation at revenue share based affiliates. Additionally, there was a decrease in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $22.5 million, primarily resulting from reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by corresponding decreases in Other non operating income (expense). These decreases were offset in part by an increase in incentives from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset, including an increase in non cash amortization expense associated with certain related deferred compensation awards, totaling $71.8 million, as well as additional costs of approximately $20.5 million associated with market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees, primarily in our global distribution group, to support on going growth initiatives.Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 43.0% from 42.6% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the impact of the change in the expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset and market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees, discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of lower corporate compensation costs, primarily attributable to our business streamlining initiative, the impact of compensation decreases related 29to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, and the decrease in transition related compensation.Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 8.9% to $649.7 million, principally driven by a $41.4 million decrease due to the previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship, as well as a $6.9 million decrease in servicing expenses as a result of our business streamlining initiative. A $5.8 million decline in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches also contributed to the decrease.Communications and technology expense increased 1.7% to $164.7 million, driven by increases, principally in data processing costs, market data costs, and consulting fees, totaling $12.2 million, primarily due to transition related costs incurred as a result of our business streamlining initiative. These increases were offset in part by $9.3 million in cost savings as a result of our streamlining changes, including reduced depreciation of technology hardware and software and consulting fees.Occupancy expense increased 12.3% to $154.8 million, primarily due to a $14.7 million net increase in lease reserves recorded in fiscal 2012, primarily related to permanently abandoning certain office space as part of our business streamlining initiative. In addition, there was a $10.3 million increase as a result of the acceleration of depreciation related to space permanently abandoned in fiscal 2012, also related to our business streamlining initiative. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the write off of a $4.1 million real estate escrow deposit in the prior year and a $3.3 million reduction in depreciation on furniture and leasehold improvements, both resulting from our business streamlining initiative.Amortization of intangibles decreased 14.6% to $19.6 million, primarily due to the full amortization of certain management contracts during fiscal 2012.Other expenses increased $14.1 million, or 8.0%, to $190.7 million, primarily as a result of an increase in expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds during the current year under expense cap arrangements.Non Operating Income (Expense)Interest income increased 24.2% to $11.5 million, driven by higher yields earned on investment balances.Interest expense decreased 5.0% to $87.6 million, primarily as a result of the retirement of our Equity Units during fiscal 2012, which reduced interest expense by $4.1 million.Other non operating income decreased $37.5 million to $22.1 million, primarily as a result of $56.0 million in net market losses on investments in proprietary fund products, which were partially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and $11.8 million due to reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases described above. These decreases were offset in part by an $11.3 million increase in dividend income, which was partially offset by a corresponding compensation increase under revenue sharing agreements, a gain of $8.6 million related to an assigned bankruptcy claim, and a gain of $7.5 million on the sale of a small affiliate.Other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles ("CIVs") increased $16.6 million to $18.3 million, due to net market gains on investments of certain CIVs.Income Tax ProvisionThe provision for income taxes was $72.1 million compared to $119.4 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2012, The U.K. Finance Act 2011 (the "Act") was enacted. The Act reduced the main U.K. corporate income tax rate from 27% to 26% effective April 1, 2011, and to 25% effective April 1, 2012. The impact of the tax rate changes on the revaluation of certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $18.3 million in the current year. The prior year also included a similar tax benefit of $8.9 million on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the restructuring of our Australian business, partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets, resulted in a net tax benefit of $10.1 million in the current year. The effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 32.7% in the prior year. Changes in the U.K. tax rate impacted the effective tax rate by 6.0 and 2.5 percentage points in the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, the restructuring of our Australian business, partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets, impacted the effective tax rate by 3.3 percentage points in the current year. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial InformationAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles, "Adjusted Income", and "Operating Margin, As Adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period to period operating performance. 30Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment VehiclesIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a CLO. In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles," we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs.We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the CIVs from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees we earn from CIVs are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly, the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs are removed from the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to us. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non GAAP basis of other companies.The following table presents a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVsTotal operating revenues $2,662,574 $3,094 $2,665,668 $2,784,317$4,133$2,788,450Total operating expenses 2,323,821 (608) 2,323,213 2,397,509(571)2,396,938Operating Income 338,753 3,702 342,455 386,8084,704391,512Other non operating income (expense) (35,670) (13,566) (49,236) (21,611)3,680(17,931)Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 303,083 (9,864) 293,219 365,1978,384373,581Income tax provision 72,052 72,052 119,434119,434Net Income (Loss) 231,031 (9,864) 221,167 245,7638,384254,147Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 10,214 (9,864) 350 (8,160)8,384224Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $220,817 $ $220,817 $253,923$$253,923Adjusted IncomeWe define "Adjusted Income" as Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets, and net money market fund support losses (gains).We believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business.Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, 31is most readily reconcilable to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., but is not a substitute for Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider Adjusted Income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, engaged in significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions.In calculating Adjusted Income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carryforward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and United Kingdom tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets, if applicable, that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle ("SIV") securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments.Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on Adjusted Income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $220,817 $253,923Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 19,574 22,913Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 135,830 134,602U.K. tax rate adjustment (18,268) (8,878)Imputed interest on convertible debt 39,077 36,688Adjusted Income $397,030 $439,248Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $1.54 $1.63Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.15Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.95 0.87U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.13) (0.06)Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.27 0.24Adjusted Income per diluted share $2.77 $2.83 32Operating Margin, as AdjustedWe calculate "Operating Margin, as Adjusted," by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of CIVs, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "Operating Revenues, as Adjusted." The compensation items, other than transition related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Transition related costs and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use Operating Revenues, as Adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Operating Revenues, as Adjusted, also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.We believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins of other companies.The calculation of Operating margin and Operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $2,662,574 $2,784,317Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 3,094 4,133Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (649,679) (712,779)Operating Revenues, as Adjusted $2,015,989 $2,075,671 Operating Income, GAAP basis $338,753 $386,808Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 13,809 36,274Transition related costs 73,066 54,434Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 3,702 4,704Operating Income, as Adjusted $429,330 $482,220 Operating margin, GAAP basis 12.7% 13.9%Operating margin, as adjusted 21.3 23.2 33FISCAL 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2010Financial OverviewNet income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2011, totaled $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase in Net Income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues, reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees, reduced interest expense, and a change in the U.K. tax rate. These increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation, the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year, and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Net Income, as previously discussed, excluding the impact of the current year U.K. tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year. Operating margin increased to 13.9% from 12.2% in the prior year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) increased to 23.2% from 20.7% in the prior year.Assets Under ManagementThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 2010Beginning of period $684.5 $632.4Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds (1) Subscriptions 49.5 38.8Redemptions (44.3) (40.2)Separate account flows, net (52.1) (76.5)Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2) (4.1)Net client cash flows (61.1) (82.0)Market performance and other (2) 56.3 134.1Dispositions (2.1) End of period $677.6 $684.5 (1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes.

The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $61 billion, which were partially offset by market appreciation of $56 billion, of which approximately 17% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, and dispositions of $2 billion, relating to the sale of a Singapore based Asian equity manager. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $37 billion, or 61% of the outflows, followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of $16 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge and LMCM, while Permal and Royce had net inflows.

Despite these global concerns, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions activity.In the fixed income markets, relatively strong economic data, combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise across the yield curve.The yield curve slightly flattened over the year as the Federal Reserve kept its funds rate at 0.25% and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period. The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond Index returning 4.28%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Bond Index, which returned 14.31% followed by U.S. TIPS, as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which returned 7.91% for the year.The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal (includes liquidity) 75% 78% 74% 84% 81% 60% 67% 91%Equity 42% 57% 61% 77% 49% 61% 72% 86%Fixed income 82% 80% 70% 81% 88% 40% 50% 88% 35The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal long term (excludes liquidity) 56% 74% 70% 67% 62% 68% 70% 80%Equity 58% 70% 68% 60% 51% 63% 65% 78%Fixed income 52% 83% 78% 85% 81% 78% 83% 87% (1) Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.

As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOperating RevenuesTotal operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2011, were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from $2.6 billion in the prior year, despite a 1% decrease in average AUM, reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees. These increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors.Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at $815.6 million, as a decrease of $25.4 million, resulting from lower average fixed income assets at Western Asset, was offset by an $18.6 million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by Batterymarch and Royce, a $5.1 million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine, and a $2.2 million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain CLOs managed by Western Asset.Investment advisory fees from funds increased $119.3 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion. Of this increase, $111.5 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at Royce, Permal, and ClearBridge, and $84.4 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset and a $36.0 million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset, primarily to maintain certain yields to investors.Performance fees increased 35%, or $25.2 million, to $96.7 million during fiscal 2011, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine.Distribution and service fees increased 1% to $379.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset.Operating ExpensesTotal compensation and benefits increased $74.1 million to $1.2 billion. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation of $45.0 million, which represents severance and retention incentive costs, increased $29.0 million, or 3%, to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by a $68.6 million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal 2011, and a $7.5 million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are recorded in Other non operating income (expense), as well as, a $6.1 million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates. The impact of reduced headcount, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives, also reduced compensation and benefits by $6.0 million. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.6% from 42.2% in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation, and transition related compensation. These increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues.Distribution and servicing expenses increased 3% to $712.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of $14.5 million in structuring fees related to closed 36end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors.Communications and technology expense decreased 1% to $162.0 million, of which $9.2 million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2011, offset in part by a $6.6 million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives.Occupancy expense decreased 12% to $137.9 million, primarily due to the impact of a $19.3 million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010.Amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at $22.9 million.Other expenses increased $8.9 million to $176.6 million, primarily as a result of a $10.3 million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs, a $5.6 million increase in state franchise taxes, a $4.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $5.4 million increase in charges related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These increases were offset in part by the impact of a $19.0 million investor settlement in the prior year.Non Operating Income (Expense)Interest income increased 26% to $9.2 million driven by higher average interest rates, offset in part by a $0.9 million decrease due to lower average investment balances.Interest expense decreased 27% to $92.2 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009 and the repayment of the $550 million outstanding term loan balance in January 2010, which reduced interest expense by $14.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively.As of March 31, 2010, all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms. Fund support gains were $23.2 million in the prior year. The gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds.Other non operating income (expense) decreased $27.3 million, primarily as a result of a $46.7 million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and a $4.3 million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of our Equity Units in the prior year.Other non operating income (expense) of CIVs decreased $15.6 million, to a gain of $1.7 million, due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a CIV.Income Tax ProvisionThe provision for income taxes was $119.4 million compared to $118.7 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2011, the U.K. Finance (No. 2) Act of 2010 was enacted, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 27% for periods beginning after April 1, 2011. The impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million.The effective tax rate was 32.7% compared to 36.0% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the U.K. tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes. In addition, the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions. 37Supplemental Non GAAP Financial InformationConsolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment VehiclesThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVsTotal operating revenues $2,784,317$4,133$2,788,450 $2,634,879 $2,779 $2,637,658Total operating expenses 2,397,509(571)2,396,938 2,313,696 680 2,314,376Operating Income 386,8084,704391,512 321,183 2,099 323,282Other non operating income (expense) (21,611)3,680(17,931) 8,473 (8,520) (47)Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 365,1978,384373,581 329,656 (6,421) 323,235Income tax provision 119,434119,434 118,676 118,676Net Income (Loss) 245,7638,384254,147 210,980 (6,421) 204,559Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (8,160)8,384224 6,623 (6,421) 202Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $253,923$$253,923 $204,357 $ $204,357 38Adjusted IncomeA reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $253,923 $204,357Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,913 22,769Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 134,602 136,252U.K. tax rate adjustment (8,878) Imputed interest on convertible debt 36,688 34,445Net money market fund support gains (1) (16,565)Adjusted Income $439,248 $381,258Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $1.63 $1.32Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.15 0.14Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.87 0.88U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.06) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.24 0.22Net money market fund support gains (1) (0.11)Adjusted Income per diluted share $2.83 $2.45(1) Net of income taxes. 39Operating Margin, as AdjustedThe calculation of Operating margin and Operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $2,784,317 $2,634,879Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 4,133 2,779Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (712,779) (691,868)Operating Revenues, as Adjusted $2,075,671 $1,945,790 Operating Income, GAAP basis $386,808 $321,183Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 36,274 79,316Transition related costs 54,434 Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 4,704 2,099Operating Income, as Adjusted $482,220 $402,598 Operating margin, GAAP basis 13.9% 12.2%Operating margin, as adjusted 23.2 20.7Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe primary objective of our capital structure is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt.The consolidation of variable interest entities discussed above does not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations.Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of our operations. At March 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.4 billion, $8.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Total assets and total liabilities of the CIVs at March 31, 2012, were $354 million and $280 million, respectively. 40The following table summarizes our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2012 2011 2010Cash flows provided by operating activities $496.8 $412.1 $1,413.1Cash flows provided by/(used in) investing activities 2.3 (44.4) (276.7)Cash flows used in financing activities (481.8) (468.5) (746.7)Effect of exchange rate changes (10.9) 10.8 19.5Net change in cash and cash equivalents 6.4 (90.0) 409.2Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,375.9 1,465.9 1,056.7Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $1,382.3 $1,375.9 $1,465.9Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2012, were $496.8 million, primarily related to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash inflows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2012, were $2.3 million, primarily related to $20.2 million of net activity related to CIVs and a release of restricted cash required for market hedge arrangements, offset in part by payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2012, were $481.8 million, primarily due to the repurchase of 13.6 million shares of our common stock for $400.3 million and dividends paid of $43.6 million. There remains $155 million under the current Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock announced in May 2010, which we intend to utilize in fiscal 2013, subject to market conditions and our performance, actual cash flows, and other capital needs. Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 were $412.1 million, primarily attributable to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 were $44.4 million, primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 were $468.5 million, primarily attributable to the repurchase of 14.6 million of our common shares for $445 million. During fiscal 2010, cash inflows provided by operating activities were $1.4 billion, of which $1.0 billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks. The remainder was primarily attributable to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements. Cash outflows used in financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million five year term loan, $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the exchange offer for our outstanding Equity Units and the payment of cash dividends. Financing TransactionsThe table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2012: Totalat March 31, Amount Outstanding atMarch 31, Type 2012 2012 2011 Interest Rate Maturity2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $1,250,000 $1,127,009 $1,087,932 2.50% January 20155.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 5.60% Retired June 2011Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, of approximately $39.1 million, $36.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. 41In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consisted of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% Senior Notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. In June 2011, the $103.0 million of outstanding debt on the remaining 5.6% senior notes from Equity Units was retired, as part of a remarketing. Concurrently, we issued 1.8 million shares of Legg Mason common stock upon the exercise of the purchase contracts from Equity Units.During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. The facility matures on February 11, 2013.In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt.The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our gross debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5 to 1. As of March 31, 2012, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7 to 1, and thus the covenant prohibits us from borrowing additional amounts as of that date. The 2.5% convertible senior notes were extinguished in May 2012, as further described in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 1 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0 to 1. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $375 million. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, and any non cash charges, as defined. As of March 31, 2012, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 to 1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 13.8 to 1. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2012.If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments.Certain of our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. The interest rate on our revolving line of credit is based on the higher credit rating of the two rating agencies. In June 2011, our rating by one of these agencies was downgraded one notch below the other. Should the other agency downgrade our rating, absent an upgrade from the former agency, our interest costs will rise modestly.Other TransactionsDuring fiscal 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Permal, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares issued by Permal and held by Permals pre acquisition owners. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we paid an aggregate amount of $7.5 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill.In May 2010, we terminated the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In this transaction, 1.1 million shares, representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis.Certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. Certain affiliates are 42also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements during the periods presented.See Notes 6, 7 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our financing transactions.Liquidity Fund SupportDuring fiscal 2010, four capital support agreements to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder prior to termination and $42 million of collateral was returned.Future OutlookWe expect that over the next 12 months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. We currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, repayment of outstanding debt, payment of increased dividends, or acquisitions.During fiscal 2012, we completed the business model streamlining initiative that began in May 2010. We incurred transition related costs of approximately $128 million through March 31, 2012, of which approximately 25% were non cash charges. Approximately $80 million of these costs have been paid to date, and substantially all of the $16.8 million remaining costs represent lease obligations to be paid over the lease terms. The initiative resulted in annual cost savings of over $140 million, which will be fully realized on an annual basis, beginning in fiscal 2013. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal 2012 and 2011.As described above, we currently project that our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2012, we had over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to $155 million of our common stock during fiscal 2013, as previously discussed. We do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next 12 months, other than to refinance existing facilities. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events result in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt.At March 31, 2012, our total cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion included $600 million held by foreign subsidiaries. Some of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to material repatriation tax effects. In a prior year, we initiated plans to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million, of which approximately $100 million had been repatriated as of March 31, 2012. Under current plans, we intend to repatriate $100 million to $150 million of foreign earnings in order to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized and to make the cash available in the U.S. All amounts planned for repatriation have been adequately provided for. No further repatriation of accumulated prior period foreign earnings beyond the above range is currently planned. However, we may repatriate future earnings to the extent required to fund domestic operations and, if tax has not previously been provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriation of these funds. It is not practical at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result from any further repatriation of foreign earnings beyond that currently planned. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for subsequent events related to our new capital plan, including $650 million issuance of 5.5% senior notes and $1.25 billion repayment of 2.5% convertible senior notes.Credit and Liquidity RiskCash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity 43or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and Contingent PaymentsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our short and long term debt, non cancelable lease agreements, and service agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments.The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year, and excludes contractual obligations of CIVs, as we are not responsible or liable for these obligations: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter TotalContractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $250.0Long term borrowings by contract maturity(2) 1.3 1.3 1,251.4 5.9 1,259.9Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2)(3) 38.1 31.7 31.6 0.3 101.7Minimum rental and service commitments 148.2 118.1 107.9 96.4 87.7 489.3 1,047.6Total Contractual Obligations(4)(5)(6) $437.6 $151.1 $1,390.9 $102.6 $87.7 $489.3 $2,659.2(1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose.(2)Excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated CLO of $271.7 million and interest on these long term borrowings, as applicable. (3)Interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2012.(4)The table above does not include approximately $36.7 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal 2018.(5)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $69.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities), because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated.(6)The table above does not include redeemable noncontrolling interests of $24.0 million, because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated.MARKET RISKWe maintain an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk.Revenues and Net IncomeThe majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM, and thus our revenues, to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business, we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. 44Trading and Non Trading AssetsOur trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products.Trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2012 2011Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $111,257 $120,107Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 222,585 204,063Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 78,277 76,340Total current investments, excluding CIVs $412,119 $400,510Approximately $80.0 million and $96.0 million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading and other current investments of $86.2 million and $72.6 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income (expense) and net income.Approximately $245.9 million and $231.9 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $12.6 million and $30.9 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $11.8 million and $39.8 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy.Non trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2012 2011Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Available for sale $11,913 $11,300Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other 34,965 22,167Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs 169,201 155,351Other investments 112 270Total non trading assets, excluding CIVs $216,191 $189,088Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2012 and 2011, includes approximately $89.3 million and $91.9 million, respectively, of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program. Fluctuations in the market value of these investments have offsetting compensation expense under revenue sharing agreements.Investment securities of CIVs totaled $31.6 million and $82.8 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and investments of CIVs totaled $294.9 million and $312.8 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we held equity investments in the CIVs of $38.9 million and $53.7 million, respectively. Fluctuations in the market value of investments of CIVs in excess of our equity investment will not impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. However, it may have an impact on other non operating income (expense) of CIVs with a corresponding offset in net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." See Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion 45of derivatives.The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2012: Carrying Value Fair ValueAssuming a20% Increase(1) Fair ValueAssuming a20% Decrease(1)Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $111,257 $133,508 $89,006Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 222,585 267,102 178,068Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 78,277 93,932 62,622Total current investments, excluding CIVs 412,119 494,542 329,696Investments in CIVs 38,919 46,703 31,135Available for sale investments 11,913 14,296 9,530Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other 34,965 41,958 27,972Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs 169,201 203,041 135,361Other investments 112 134 90Total investments subject to market risk $667,229 $800,674 $533,784(1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $11.8 million have been economically hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $81.5 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of March 31, 2012.Foreign Exchange SensitivityWe operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Poland, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity.Interest Rate RiskExposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as substantially all of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $250.0 million of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2012, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESAccounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments.ConsolidationEffective April 1, 2010, we adopted revised accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, "Consolidation," (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R)") ("SFAS No. 167"), relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") which includes a 46new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE, changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE, and changes in the assessment of which entities are VIEs. The application of the revised accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds, including money market funds. Investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46(R)").In the normal course of our business, we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles. Certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be VIEs while others are considered to be voting rights entities ("VREs") subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were not material at March 31, 2012. We have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these VIEs, VREs or their investors. Investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle.Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) (Accounting Standards Update 2010 10, "Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds")For most sponsored investment funds, including money market funds, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker if certain criteria are met. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary.Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167 (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, "Consolidation")We sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities ("CDOs") and CLOs that do not qualify for the deferral, and are assessed under the revised accounting guidance, as follows. We determine whether we have a variable interest in a VIE by considering if, among other things, we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that are expected to be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return. If we have a significant variable interest, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that potentially could be significant to the VIE.In evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is more than insignificant.Legg Mason must consolidate VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs.Revenue RecognitionThe vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith.For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a 47combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition.As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian.Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2012, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $163.4 billion, $356.1 billion and $123.8 billion, respectively.As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2012, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs.Valuation of Financial InstrumentsSubstantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except our long term debt. Trading investments, investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.For equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investees net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non operating income (expense).For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined.For investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, excluding 48investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $11.9 million and $23.8 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs.At March 31, 2012 and 2011, we also have approximately $204.2 million and $177.5 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $169.2 million and $155.4 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is accounted for under the cost method, which considers if factors indicate there may be an impairment in the value of these investments. In addition, as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $78.3 million and $76.3 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets.Level 2 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. This category also includes CLO loans and liabilities of a CIV, and previously included certain derivative assets and liabilities of CIVs.Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes investments in partnerships, limited liability companies and private equity funds. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and CLO debt of a CIV.The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.Proprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at net asset value ("NAV") determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3.The fair values of CLO loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as Level 2. Legg Mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. The fair value of CLO debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the CLOs underlying collateral assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement, the CLO debt valuation is classified as Level 3.Exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale, the last offering price. Options traded over 49the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations. Options are classified as Level 1. Futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps previously held were valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and classified as Level 2.As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date.As of March 31, 2012, approximately 3% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 10% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 2% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3.Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period.See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Intangible Assets and GoodwillBalances as of March 31, 2012, are as follows:Amortizable asset management contracts $33,437Indefinite life intangible assets 3,753,629Trade names 69,800Goodwill 1,275,045 $5,131,911Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below.For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, internal budgets, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions.Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities.Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. 50We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2011, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of that date. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2012, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2012, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary.Amortizable Intangible AssetsIntangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to five years with a weighted average life of approximately 2.9 years.Indefinite Life Intangible AssetsFor intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names.We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary.Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million account for approximately 65% of our indefinite life intangible assets and are managed primarily by ClearBridge and Western Asset. Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 25% of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2011, annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 7%. Cash flows on the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 9%. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 13.0% and 14.5%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 5% and 35%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 13.5% and 19.5%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. Given the current uncertainty regarding future market conditions, it is reasonably possible that fund performance, flows and AUM levels may decrease in the near term such that actual cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts could deviate from the projections by more than 5% and the asset could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $124 million and $606 million, respectively.Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts, and the resulting fair values significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts. 51GoodwillGoodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team, which during fiscal 2012, resulted in the combination of our Americas and International divisions into one operating segment, Global Asset Management. Internal management reporting has been modified consistent with this realignment such that discrete financial information regularly received by the chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, is at the consolidated Global Asset Management business level. As a result, the former Americas and International operating segments are no longer our reporting units, and subsequently, goodwill is recorded and evaluated at one Global Asset Management reporting unit level. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments.Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) and by investment manager based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values.Goodwill principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM, Permal and Royce. The value of the reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our managers. For our annual December 31 impairment test, the projected cash flows are discounted at 14.0% to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2011, the implied fair value significantly exceeds the carrying value. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes, are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 8%. Cash flow growth is based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections are based on long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business, available historical experience and market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate approximately 51% from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately eight percentage points for goodwill to be considered for impairment.As of December 31, 2011, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting unit.Stock Based CompensationOur stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees.In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Also, under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows.We granted 0.8 million, 0.7 million, and 1.5 million stock options in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 52We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we would use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different.Income TaxesWe are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes.These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision.Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and U.K. taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2012, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $718 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.1 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $169 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to $10.4 million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance of $3.4 million was recorded in fiscal 2012 with respect thereto. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2012, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $237 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $12.1 million for fiscal 2012. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. A net release of $7.3 million in fiscal 2012 of the full valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets related to various jurisdictions, primarily the U.K. and Japan. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSSee discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSWe have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and 53statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, including expected earnings per share in future periods, anticipated future investment performance of our affiliates, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance.Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of our AUM; the mix of our AUM among our affiliates; the revenue yield of our AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products both in absolute terms and relative to competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions.Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations.EFFECTS OF INFLATIONThe rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWLegg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise "Legg Mason") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the United States of America ("U.S.") and the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. All references to fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010, refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as "we," "us," "our," and "Company" refer to Legg Mason.In connection with a realignment of our executive management team during fiscal 2011, we no longer manage our business in two divisions and, during fiscal 2012, eliminated the previous separation of the Americas and International divisions and combined them into one operating segment, Global Asset Management. We believe this structure allows us to function as a global organization with a single purpose. As a result of this change, we no longer present assets under management ("AUM") or revenues by division.Our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees, from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our AUM and fee rates, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain AUM and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our AUM primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance, both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products, of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential clients situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions.The fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of assets under management, the asset management affiliate that provides the services, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues will be affected by the composition of our AUM. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. As such, our Net income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one affiliate can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate. In addition, from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability.The most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels, non compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share based affiliates, and profits. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense, which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are fixed in nature, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity.Our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets, particularly in the United States, but also in the other countries in which we operate. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our AUM, and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates, among other things. Periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attracting and retaining key 23employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients. In the last few years, the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share. In addition, the economic downturn of fiscal years 2008 and 2009 contributed to a significant contraction in our business and we have not recovered to pre downturn levels. The financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, broker dealers and commercial banks. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, and in prior years, by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions.The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been impacted by regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability.Our strategy is focused on three primary areas listed below. Management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition. Consistent with this approach, we have also listed below the most important matters on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition.Outstanding independent investment managers:The investment performance of our asset management products and services compared to their benchmarks and to the performance of competitive products for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods.Our AUM, the components of the changes in our AUM amid continued market uncertainty, the long term trend of outflows in AUM, and the resulting impact of changes in AUM on our revenues.A corporate center that delivers strategic value:Promote revenue growth through strategic marketing of products to institutional clients, supported by retail and instividual (e.g., 401(k) plans) distribution globally.Management of expenses.Allocating capital for diversified growth and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate:The amount of excess capital we generate, and deployment of that capital through share repurchases, investments in proprietary fund products, dividends and targeted acquisitions.The following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAlthough the financial environment, both globally and in the U.S., continued to rebound during fiscal 2012, challenging and volatile conditions persisted throughout a portion of our fiscal year. Economic uncertainties related to the European debt crisis slowed the global economy, and the unprecedented downgrade to the U.S. credit rating in August 2011 contributed to a sharp decline in the equity markets during the first half of fiscal 2012. In spite of the challenging conditions during the first half of our fiscal year, economic interventions which eased the European debt crisis, and continuing improvement in U.S. employment rates and consumer confidence, resulted in equity market increases during the second half of the fiscal year which more than offset earlier market declines. During fiscal 2012, the Federal Reserve Board held the federal funds rate at 0.25%, the lowest in history. While the economic outlook has been more positive than in recent years, the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging, as we move into fiscal 2013.All three major U.S. equity market indices, as well as the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index, increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below: % Change as of and for the year ended March 31:Indices(1) 2012 2011Dow Jones Industrial Average 7.24% 13.48%S&P 500 6.23% 13.37%NASDAQ Composite Index 11.16% 15.98%Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 7.71% 5.12%Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index 5.26% 7.15%(1)Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. 24The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period: Percentage of Operating Revenues Period to Period Change(1) Years EndedMarch 31, 2012Compared 2011Compared 2012 2011 2010 to 2011 to 2010Operating Revenues Investment advisory fees Separate accounts 29.1% 29.3% 30.9% (4.9)% 0.1%Funds 56.0 53.4 51.9 0.3 8.7Performance fees 1.9 3.5 2.7 (48.8) 35.3Distribution and service fees 12.8 13.6 14.3 (10.1) 1.0Other 0.2 0.2 0.2 (16.0) 4.6Total operating revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 (4.4) 5.7Operating Expenses Compensation and benefits 41.7 41.0 42.2 (2.7) 2.6Transition related compensation 1.3 1.6 (23.1) n/m Total compensation and benefits 43.0 42.6 42.2 (3.5) 6.7Distribution and servicing 24.4 25.6 26.3 (8.9) 3.0Communications and technology 6.2 5.8 6.2 1.7 (0.7)Occupancy 5.8 5.0 6.0 12.3 (12.2)Amortization of intangible assets 0.7 0.8 0.8 (14.6) 0.6Other 7.2 6.3 6.3 8.0 5.3Total operating expenses 87.3 86.1 87.8 (3.1) 3.6Operating Income 12.7 13.9 12.2 (12.4) 20.4Other Income (Expense) Interest income 0.4 0.3 0.3 24.2 25.7Interest expense (3.3) (3.3) (4.8) (5.0) (27.0)Fund support 0.9 n/m n/mOther 0.8 2.1 3.2 (62.9) (31.4)Other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles 0.8 0.1 0.7 (65.1) (90.2)Total other income (expense) (1.3) (0.8) 0.3 n/m n/mIncome before Income Tax Provision 11.4 13.1 12.5 (17.0) 10.8Income tax provision 2.7 4.3 4.5 (39.7) 0.6Net Income 8.7 8.8 8.0 (6.0) 16.5Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 (0.3) 0.2 n/m n/mNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. 8.3% 9.1% 7.8% (13.0)% 24.3%n/m not meaningful(1) Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. 25FISCAL 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2011Financial OverviewNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2012, totaled $220.8 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in the prior year. The decrease in Net Income was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset Management Company ("Western Asset"), the impact of net market losses on proprietary fund products and assets invested for deferred compensation plans which are not offset in compensation and benefits, and the net impact of decreased operating revenues. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of cost savings due to our business streamlining initiative, and the impact of tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary and U.K. tax rate changes. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) decreased to $397.0 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2012, from $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in Net Income, previously discussed, excluding the impact of U.K. tax rate adjustments. Operating margin decreased to 12.7% from 13.9% in the prior year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information), for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, was 21.3% and 23.2%, respectively.Assets Under ManagementThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31, were as follows: 2012 2011Beginning of period $677.6 $684.5Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds(1) Subscriptions 46.9 49.5Redemptions (51.1) (44.3)Separate account flows, net (35.9) (52.1)Liquidity fund flows, net 12.6 (14.2)Net client cash flows (27.5) (61.1)Market performance and other (2) 17.1 56.3Dispositions (23.9) (2.1)End of period $643.3 $677.6(1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. (2) Includes impact of foreign exchange, reinvestment of dividends, and other. AUM at March 31, 2012, was $643.3 billion, a decrease of $34.3 billion, or 5%, from March 31, 2011. The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $27.5 billion and dispositions of $23.9 billion, which were partially offset by market performance and other of $17.1 billion, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The majority of dispositions were in liquidity assets, $19.9 billion, which resulted from the amendment of historical Smith Barney brokerage programs discussed below. There were also $4.0 billion in dispositions from the divestiture of two small affiliates. Long term asset classes accounted for the net client outflows, with $21.3 billion and $18.6 billion in equity and fixed income outflows, respectively, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $12.4 billion. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at Legg Mason Capital Management, Inc. ("LMCM"), ClearBridge Advisors LLC ("ClearBridge"), Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. (Batterymarch) and Royce & Associates (Royce). Due in part to investment performance issues, we have experienced net annual outflows in our equity asset class since fiscal 2007. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset, including $12.7 billion in outflows from a single, low fee global sovereign mandate. We expect to continue to experience outflows from this mandate of approximately $1 billion per month during fiscal 2013. With the exception of the June 2011 quarter, we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal 2008. We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and Net Income than would outflows in other asset classes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ("MSSB") amended certain historical Smith Barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage that resulted in a reduction of $19.9 billion in liquidity AUM during the year ended March 31, 2012. As a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition, the disposition of this liquidity AUM resulted in a reduction in operating revenue of $52.3 million, net of related fee waivers, in the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011. The disposition of this AUM also resulted in reductions in distribution and servicing expenses of $41.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2011. We expect the amendments to result in an additional $6 billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next four months. 26Our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance.AUM by Asset ClassAUM by asset class (in billions) as of March 31 was as follows: 2012 % ofTotal 2011 % ofTotal %Change Equity $163.4 26% $189.6 28% (14)%Fixed Income 356.1 55 356.6 53 Liquidity 123.8 19 131.4 19 (6)Total $643.3 100% $677.6 100% (5)%The component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, were as follows: Equity FixedIncome Liquidity TotalMarch 31, 2011 $189.6 $356.6 $131.4 $677.6Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds Subscriptions 21.7 25.2 46.9Redemptions (30.4) (20.7) (51.1)Separate account flows, net (12.6) (23.1) (0.2) (35.9)Liquidity fund flows, net 12.6 12.6Net client cash flows (21.3) (18.6) 12.4 (27.5)Market performance and other (2.1) 19.3 (0.1) 17.1Dispositions (2.8) (1.2) (19.9) (23.9)March 31, 2012 $163.4 $356.1 $123.8 $643.3Average AUM by asset class (in billions) for the year ended March 31 were as follows: 2012 % ofTotal 2011 % ofTotal %ChangeEquity $168.4 26% $173.8 26% (3)%Fixed Income 359.8 56 361.6 54 Liquidity 116.6 18 133.8 20 (13)Total $644.8 100% $669.2 100% (4)%Investment Performance(1) Overall investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended March 31, 2012, was generally positive compared to relevant benchmarks.The equity markets ended a difficult year on a positive note, responding favorably to improving unemployment figures, the conclusion of bank stress tests resulting in certain banks increasing dividends, and reduced fears of a European debt fallout. As a result, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year. The most notable was the NASDAQ Composite returning 11.2% for the year ended March 31, 2012.In the fixed income markets, improved economic data suggested that the recovery was strengthening. Flights to safety ebbed as the European debt crisis eased allowing U.S. Treasury rates to climb from historically low levels. The yield curve steepened over the year as economic releases from the Federal Reserve Board painted an increasingly optimistic picture and talk of a third round of quantitative easing diminished. 27The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was high yield bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Index returning 6.5%. The best performing fixed income sector for the year was Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index returning 12.2% as of March 31, 2012.The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2012 As of March 31, 2011 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal (includes liquidity) 60% 80% 69% 86% 75% 78% 74% 84%Equity 48% 47% 66% 80% 42% 57% 61% 77%Fixed income 49% 87% 58% 83% 82% 80% 70% 81%The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category averages as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2012 As of March 31, 2011 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal long term (excludes liquidity) 67% 66% 78% 74% 56% 74% 70% 67%Equity 57% 56% 73% 71% 58% 70% 68% 60%Fixed income 84% 81% 87% 83% 52% 83% 78% 85%(1)Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.(2)A composite is an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts and investment funds) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective or strategy. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in their marketed composites. Assets under management that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines are not included in a composite. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, 91% and 89% of our equity assets under management and 88% and 89% of our fixed income assets under management, respectively, were in marketed composites.(3)Source: Lipper Inc. includes open end, closed end, and variable annuity funds. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 18% and 17%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites.Business Model Streamlining InitiativeIn May 2010, we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that primarilyinvolved transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships. The initiative resulted in over $140 million in cost savings, which will be fully realized on an annual basis, beginning in fiscal 2013. These cost savings consist of (i) over $80 million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates, and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements; (ii) approximately $50 million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units, including savings associated with consolidating office space; and (iii) approximately $10 million from our global distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements.The initiative involved $127.5 million in transition related costs that primarily included charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period. The transition related costs also included charges for consolidating leased office space, early contract terminations, accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, asset disposals and professional fees. During the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, transition related costs totaled $73.1 million and $54.4 million, respectively. All transition related costs have been accrued as of March 31, 2012. Significant events of fiscal 2012 related to the initiative included the transition of shared services to our affiliates, as well as reductions in force made over three phases. For the year ended March 31, 2012, we have achieved total estimated transition related savings of approximately $97 million, and we expect total annual savings of approximately $140 million beginning in fiscal 2013, when compared to similar expenses prior to the commencement of the streamlining initiative. A majority of the estimated transition related savings were first achieved in fiscal 2012, and are noted, where applicable, in the results of operations discussion to follow. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative. 28RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity ("CLO"). The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non operating income (expense), is reflected in our Net Income, net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the consolidation of investment vehicles is presented below in our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles" (See Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information). Also, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles.Operating RevenuesTotal operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2012, were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 4.4% from $2.8 billion in the prior year, primarily due to a 4% decrease in average AUM and a $47.2 million decrease in performance fees. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in average AUM revenue yields, from 34.4 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2011, to 35.2 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2012, resulting from a more favorable average asset mix. The previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship resulted in a reduction in operating revenues of $52.3 million, net of related fee waivers, in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition.Investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased $40.1 million, or 4.9%, to $775.5 million. Of this decrease, $25.9 million was primarily the result of lower average equity assets managed by LMCM, Batterymarch, ClearBridge and Legg Mason Investment Counsel & Trust Company ("LMIC"), and $8.0 million was primarily due to the divestiture of a Singapore based asset manager in fiscal 2011. These decreases were offset in part by an increase of $6.7 million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine Global Management, LLC ("Brandywine").Investment advisory fees from funds remained essentially flat at $1.5 billion for both periods. Higher average equity assets managed by Royce and ClearBridge, and higher average fixed income assets, primarily managed at Western Asset, resulted in an increase of $41.3 million and $41.1 million, respectively. These increases were offset by a decrease of $51.3 million, net of related fee waivers, due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset, primarily as a result of the previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to our MSSB relationship, as well as a $31.5 million decrease as a result of lower average equity assets managed by LMCM and Permal Group, Ltd. ("Permal").Performance fees decreased 48.8%, or $47.2 million, to $49.5 million during the year ended March 31, 2012, primarily as a result of lower fees earned on assets managed at Permal and Western Asset, offset slightly by an increase in performance fees earned on assets managed at Brandywine. Distribution and service fees decreased $38.2 million, or 10.1%, to $341.0 million, primarily due to the disposition of the liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship, as well as a decline in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and service fees.Operating ExpensesTotal compensation and benefits decreased $41.0 million to $1.1 billion. Transition related compensation decreased $10.4 million to $34.6 million, and represents accruals for severance and retention costs related to our business streamlining initiative. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation, decreased $30.6 million, or 2.7%, to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by a $49.8 million decrease in corporate compensation, primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our business streamlining initiative, as well as a $43.2 million net decrease in compensation at revenue share based affiliates. Additionally, there was a decrease in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of $22.5 million, primarily resulting from reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, which are offset by corresponding decreases in Other non operating income (expense). These decreases were offset in part by an increase in incentives from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset, including an increase in non cash amortization expense associated with certain related deferred compensation awards, totaling $71.8 million, as well as additional costs of approximately $20.5 million associated with market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees, primarily in our global distribution group, to support on going growth initiatives.Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 43.0% from 42.6% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the impact of the change in the expense reimbursement arrangement with Western Asset and market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees, discussed above. These increases were offset in part by the impact of lower corporate compensation costs, primarily attributable to our business streamlining initiative, the impact of compensation decreases related 29to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments, and the decrease in transition related compensation.Distribution and servicing expenses decreased 8.9% to $649.7 million, principally driven by a $41.4 million decrease due to the previously discussed disposition of liquidity AUM related to the MSSB relationship, as well as a $6.9 million decrease in servicing expenses as a result of our business streamlining initiative. A $5.8 million decline in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches also contributed to the decrease.Communications and technology expense increased 1.7% to $164.7 million, driven by increases, principally in data processing costs, market data costs, and consulting fees, totaling $12.2 million, primarily due to transition related costs incurred as a result of our business streamlining initiative. These increases were offset in part by $9.3 million in cost savings as a result of our streamlining changes, including reduced depreciation of technology hardware and software and consulting fees.Occupancy expense increased 12.3% to $154.8 million, primarily due to a $14.7 million net increase in lease reserves recorded in fiscal 2012, primarily related to permanently abandoning certain office space as part of our business streamlining initiative. In addition, there was a $10.3 million increase as a result of the acceleration of depreciation related to space permanently abandoned in fiscal 2012, also related to our business streamlining initiative. These increases were offset in part by the impact of the write off of a $4.1 million real estate escrow deposit in the prior year and a $3.3 million reduction in depreciation on furniture and leasehold improvements, both resulting from our business streamlining initiative.Amortization of intangibles decreased 14.6% to $19.6 million, primarily due to the full amortization of certain management contracts during fiscal 2012.Other expenses increased $14.1 million, or 8.0%, to $190.7 million, primarily as a result of an increase in expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds during the current year under expense cap arrangements.Non Operating Income (Expense)Interest income increased 24.2% to $11.5 million, driven by higher yields earned on investment balances.Interest expense decreased 5.0% to $87.6 million, primarily as a result of the retirement of our Equity Units during fiscal 2012, which reduced interest expense by $4.1 million.Other non operating income decreased $37.5 million to $22.1 million, primarily as a result of $56.0 million in net market losses on investments in proprietary fund products, which were partially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and $11.8 million due to reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases described above. These decreases were offset in part by an $11.3 million increase in dividend income, which was partially offset by a corresponding compensation increase under revenue sharing agreements, a gain of $8.6 million related to an assigned bankruptcy claim, and a gain of $7.5 million on the sale of a small affiliate.Other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles ("CIVs") increased $16.6 million to $18.3 million, due to net market gains on investments of certain CIVs.Income Tax ProvisionThe provision for income taxes was $72.1 million compared to $119.4 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2012, The U.K. Finance Act 2011 (the "Act") was enacted. The Act reduced the main U.K. corporate income tax rate from 27% to 26% effective April 1, 2011, and to 25% effective April 1, 2012. The impact of the tax rate changes on the revaluation of certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $18.3 million in the current year. The prior year also included a similar tax benefit of $8.9 million on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the restructuring of our Australian business, partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets, resulted in a net tax benefit of $10.1 million in the current year. The effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 32.7% in the prior year. Changes in the U.K. tax rate impacted the effective tax rate by 6.0 and 2.5 percentage points in the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, the restructuring of our Australian business, partially offset by adjustments to the net value of certain deferred tax assets, impacted the effective tax rate by 3.3 percentage points in the current year. Supplemental Non GAAP Financial InformationAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) for Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles, "Adjusted Income", and "Operating Margin, As Adjusted" that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period to period operating performance. 30Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment VehiclesIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles, the most significant of which is a CLO. In presenting our "Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles," we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs.We believe it is important to provide the Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations, which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested. By deconsolidating the CIVs from the Consolidated Statements of Income, the investment advisory and distribution fees we earn from CIVs are added back to reflect our actual revenues. Similarly, the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income (expense) and noncontrolling interests of CIVs are removed from the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income since this activity does not actually belong to us. The deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in any period presented. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles are presented in addition to our GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income, but are not substitutes for the GAAP basis Consolidated Statements of Income and may not be comparable to Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a non GAAP basis of other companies.The following table presents a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVsTotal operating revenues $2,662,574 $3,094 $2,665,668 $2,784,317$4,133$2,788,450Total operating expenses 2,323,821 (608) 2,323,213 2,397,509(571)2,396,938Operating Income 338,753 3,702 342,455 386,8084,704391,512Other non operating income (expense) (35,670) (13,566) (49,236) (21,611)3,680(17,931)Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 303,083 (9,864) 293,219 365,1978,384373,581Income tax provision 72,052 72,052 119,434119,434Net Income (Loss) 231,031 (9,864) 221,167 245,7638,384254,147Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 10,214 (9,864) 350 (8,160)8,384224Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $220,817 $ $220,817 $253,923$$253,923Adjusted IncomeWe define "Adjusted Income" as Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill, and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets, and net money market fund support losses (gains).We believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, made significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business.Adjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, 31is most readily reconcilable to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., but is not a substitute for Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. We consider Adjusted Income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt, engaged in significant acquisitions, or engaged in money market fund support transactions.In calculating Adjusted Income, we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, such as management contracts, to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carryforward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and United Kingdom tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets, if applicable, that have been recognized under GAAP. We also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt, which is a non cash expense, as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under GAAP. We also add (subtract) other non core items, such as net money market fund support losses (gains) (net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle ("SIV") securities, if applicable). These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions, including any related impairments.Should a disposition, impairment charge or other non core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Also, realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on Adjusted Income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.Although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.A reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $220,817 $253,923Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 19,574 22,913Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 135,830 134,602U.K. tax rate adjustment (18,268) (8,878)Imputed interest on convertible debt 39,077 36,688Adjusted Income $397,030 $439,248Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $1.54 $1.63Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.14 0.15Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.95 0.87U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.13) (0.06)Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.27 0.24Adjusted Income per diluted share $2.77 $2.83 32Operating Margin, as AdjustedWe calculate "Operating Margin, as Adjusted," by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, transition related costs of streamlining our business model, income (loss) of CIVs, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, which we refer to as "Operating Revenues, as Adjusted." The compensation items, other than transition related costs, are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Other non operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Transition related costs and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use Operating Revenues, as Adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Operating Revenues, as Adjusted, also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.We believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, transition related costs, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins of other companies.The calculation of Operating margin and Operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $2,662,574 $2,784,317Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 3,094 4,133Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (649,679) (712,779)Operating Revenues, as Adjusted $2,015,989 $2,075,671 Operating Income, GAAP basis $338,753 $386,808Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 13,809 36,274Transition related costs 73,066 54,434Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 3,702 4,704Operating Income, as Adjusted $429,330 $482,220 Operating margin, GAAP basis 12.7% 13.9%Operating margin, as adjusted 21.3 23.2 33FISCAL 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2010Financial OverviewNet income attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2011, totaled $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $204.4 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in the prior year. The increase in Net Income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues, reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees, reduced interest expense, and a change in the U.K. tax rate. These increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation, the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year, and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches. These items are further discussed in "Results of Operations" below. Adjusted Income (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Net Income, as previously discussed, excluding the impact of the current year U.K. tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year. Operating margin increased to 13.9% from 12.2% in the prior year. Operating margin, as adjusted (see Supplemental Non GAAP Financial Information) increased to 23.2% from 20.7% in the prior year.Assets Under ManagementThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows: 2011 2010Beginning of period $684.5 $632.4Investment funds, excluding liquidity funds (1) Subscriptions 49.5 38.8Redemptions (44.3) (40.2)Separate account flows, net (52.1) (76.5)Liquidity fund flows, net (14.2) (4.1)Net client cash flows (61.1) (82.0)Market performance and other (2) 56.3 134.1Dispositions (2.1) End of period $677.6 $684.5 (1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes.

The decrease in AUM was attributable to net client outflows of $61 billion, which were partially offset by market appreciation of $56 billion, of which approximately 17% resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation, and dispositions of $2 billion, relating to the sale of a Singapore based Asian equity manager. The majority of outflows were in fixed income with $37 billion, or 61% of the outflows, followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of $16 billion and $8 billion, respectively. The majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by Western Asset. Equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at ClearBridge and LMCM, while Permal and Royce had net inflows.

Despite these global concerns, most U.S. indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions activity.In the fixed income markets, relatively strong economic data, combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise across the yield curve.The yield curve slightly flattened over the year as the Federal Reserve kept its funds rate at 0.25% and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period. The worst performing fixed income sector for the year was Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Bond Index returning 4.28%, in contrast to High Yield Bonds, as measured by the Barclays High Yield Bond Index, which returned 14.31% followed by U.S. TIPS, as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which returned 7.91% for the year.The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets(2) that outpaced their benchmarks as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal (includes liquidity) 75% 78% 74% 84% 81% 60% 67% 91%Equity 42% 57% 61% 77% 49% 61% 72% 86%Fixed income 82% 80% 70% 81% 88% 40% 50% 88% 35The following table presents a summary of the percentage of our U.S. mutual fund assets(3) that outpaced their Lipper category as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, for the trailing 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 10 year periods: As of March 31, 2011 As of March 31, 2010 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year 1 year 3 year 5 year 10 yearTotal long term (excludes liquidity) 56% 74% 70% 67% 62% 68% 70% 80%Equity 58% 70% 68% 60% 51% 63% 65% 78%Fixed income 52% 83% 78% 85% 81% 78% 83% 87% (1) Index performance in this section includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.

As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the U.S. long term mutual fund assets represented in the data accounted for 17% and 16%, respectively, of our total assets under management. The performance of our U.S. long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOperating RevenuesTotal operating revenues for the year ended March 31, 2011, were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from $2.6 billion in the prior year, despite a 1% decrease in average AUM, reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees. These increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors.Investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at $815.6 million, as a decrease of $25.4 million, resulting from lower average fixed income assets at Western Asset, was offset by an $18.6 million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by Batterymarch and Royce, a $5.1 million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine, and a $2.2 million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain CLOs managed by Western Asset.Investment advisory fees from funds increased $119.3 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion. Of this increase, $111.5 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at Royce, Permal, and ClearBridge, and $84.4 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at Western Asset. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at Western Asset and a $36.0 million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset, primarily to maintain certain yields to investors.Performance fees increased 35%, or $25.2 million, to $96.7 million during fiscal 2011, driven by fees earned on assets managed at Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine.Distribution and service fees increased 1% to $379.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by Western Asset.Operating ExpensesTotal compensation and benefits increased $74.1 million to $1.2 billion. Compensation and benefits, excluding transition related compensation of $45.0 million, which represents severance and retention incentive costs, increased $29.0 million, or 3%, to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by a $68.6 million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal 2011, and a $7.5 million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel. These increases were offset in part by a $45.7 million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are recorded in Other non operating income (expense), as well as, a $6.1 million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates. The impact of reduced headcount, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives, also reduced compensation and benefits by $6.0 million. Compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42.6% from 42.2% in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation, and transition related compensation. These increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues.Distribution and servicing expenses increased 3% to $712.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase in average AUM in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of $14.5 million in structuring fees related to closed 36end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors.Communications and technology expense decreased 1% to $162.0 million, of which $9.2 million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal 2011, offset in part by a $6.6 million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees, primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives.Occupancy expense decreased 12% to $137.9 million, primarily due to the impact of a $19.3 million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal 2010.Amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at $22.9 million.Other expenses increased $8.9 million to $176.6 million, primarily as a result of a $10.3 million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs, a $5.6 million increase in state franchise taxes, a $4.2 million increase in professional fees, and a $5.4 million increase in charges related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These increases were offset in part by the impact of a $19.0 million investor settlement in the prior year.Non Operating Income (Expense)Interest income increased 26% to $9.2 million driven by higher average interest rates, offset in part by a $0.9 million decrease due to lower average investment balances.Interest expense decreased 27% to $92.2 million, primarily as a result of the exchange of our Equity Units in August 2009 and the repayment of the $550 million outstanding term loan balance in January 2010, which reduced interest expense by $14.8 million and $12.2 million, respectively.As of March 31, 2010, all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms. Fund support gains were $23.2 million in the prior year. The gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized, non cash losses recorded in fiscal 2009 on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds.Other non operating income (expense) decreased $27.3 million, primarily as a result of a $46.7 million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above, and a $4.3 million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products. These decreases were offset in part by the impact of $22.0 million in charges related to the exchange of our Equity Units in the prior year.Other non operating income (expense) of CIVs decreased $15.6 million, to a gain of $1.7 million, due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a CIV.Income Tax ProvisionThe provision for income taxes was $119.4 million compared to $118.7 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2011, the U.K. Finance (No. 2) Act of 2010 was enacted, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 27% for periods beginning after April 1, 2011. The impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million.The effective tax rate was 32.7% compared to 36.0% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the U.K. tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes. In addition, the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions. 37Supplemental Non GAAP Financial InformationConsolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment VehiclesThe following table presents a reconciliation of our Consolidated Statements of Income presented on a GAAP basis to our Consolidated Statements of Income, Excluding Consolidated Investment Vehicles for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVs GAAP Basis CIVs Non GAAP Basis Excluding CIVsTotal operating revenues $2,784,317$4,133$2,788,450 $2,634,879 $2,779 $2,637,658Total operating expenses 2,397,509(571)2,396,938 2,313,696 680 2,314,376Operating Income 386,8084,704391,512 321,183 2,099 323,282Other non operating income (expense) (21,611)3,680(17,931) 8,473 (8,520) (47)Income (Loss) before Income Tax Provision 365,1978,384373,581 329,656 (6,421) 323,235Income tax provision 119,434119,434 118,676 118,676Net Income (Loss) 245,7638,384254,147 210,980 (6,421) 204,559Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (8,160)8,384224 6,623 (6,421) 202Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $253,923$$253,923 $204,357 $ $204,357 38Adjusted IncomeA reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows: For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. $253,923 $204,357Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 22,913 22,769Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 134,602 136,252U.K. tax rate adjustment (8,878) Imputed interest on convertible debt 36,688 34,445Net money market fund support gains (1) (16,565)Adjusted Income $439,248 $381,258Net Income per diluted share attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. common shareholders $1.63 $1.32Plus (less): Amortization of intangible assets 0.15 0.14Deferred income taxes on intangible assets: Tax amortization benefit 0.87 0.88U.K. tax rate adjustment (0.06) Imputed interest on convertible debt 0.24 0.22Net money market fund support gains (1) (0.11)Adjusted Income per diluted share $2.83 $2.45(1) Net of income taxes. 39Operating Margin, as AdjustedThe calculation of Operating margin and Operating margin, as adjusted, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010Operating Revenues, GAAP basis $2,784,317 $2,634,879Plus (less): Operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles 4,133 2,779Distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles (712,779) (691,868)Operating Revenues, as Adjusted $2,075,671 $1,945,790 Operating Income, GAAP basis $386,808 $321,183Plus (less): Gains (losses) on deferred compensation and seed investments 36,274 79,316Transition related costs 54,434 Operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles 4,704 2,099Operating Income, as Adjusted $482,220 $402,598 Operating margin, GAAP basis 13.9% 12.2%Operating margin, as adjusted 23.2 20.7Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe primary objective of our capital structure is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and, subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt.The consolidation of variable interest entities discussed above does not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations.Our assets consist primarily of intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents, goodwill, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long term debt and the results of our operations. At March 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long term debt and stockholders equity were $1.4 billion, $8.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Total assets and total liabilities of the CIVs at March 31, 2012, were $354 million and $280 million, respectively. 40The following table summarizes our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions): 2012 2011 2010Cash flows provided by operating activities $496.8 $412.1 $1,413.1Cash flows provided by/(used in) investing activities 2.3 (44.4) (276.7)Cash flows used in financing activities (481.8) (468.5) (746.7)Effect of exchange rate changes (10.9) 10.8 19.5Net change in cash and cash equivalents 6.4 (90.0) 409.2Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,375.9 1,465.9 1,056.7Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $1,382.3 $1,375.9 $1,465.9Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2012, were $496.8 million, primarily related to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash inflows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2012, were $2.3 million, primarily related to $20.2 million of net activity related to CIVs and a release of restricted cash required for market hedge arrangements, offset in part by payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2012, were $481.8 million, primarily due to the repurchase of 13.6 million shares of our common stock for $400.3 million and dividends paid of $43.6 million. There remains $155 million under the current Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock announced in May 2010, which we intend to utilize in fiscal 2013, subject to market conditions and our performance, actual cash flows, and other capital needs. Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 were $412.1 million, primarily attributable to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 were $44.4 million, primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 were $468.5 million, primarily attributable to the repurchase of 14.6 million of our common shares for $445 million. During fiscal 2010, cash inflows provided by operating activities were $1.4 billion, of which $1.0 billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks. The remainder was primarily attributable to Net Income, adjusted for non cash items. Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 were $276.7 million, primarily attributable to cash payments of $180 million made in connection with the acquisition of Permal, and payments for fixed assets of $84.1 million, principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, partially offset by fund support collateral received of $38.9 million due to the amendment, termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements. Cash outflows used in financing activities were $746.7 million, primarily due to the repayment in January 2010 of the remaining $550 million outstanding balance on our $700 million five year term loan, $135.0 million of cash consideration paid in the exchange offer for our outstanding Equity Units and the payment of cash dividends. Financing TransactionsThe table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2012: Totalat March 31, Amount Outstanding atMarch 31, Type 2012 2012 2011 Interest Rate Maturity2.5% Convertible Senior Notes $1,250,000 $1,127,009 $1,087,932 2.50% January 20155.6% Senior Notes from Equity Units 103,039 5.60% Retired June 2011Revolving Credit Agreement 500,000 250,000 250,000 LIBOR + 2.625% February 2013During January 2008, we increased our capital base by $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes. The proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of SIV securities from our liquidity funds. The senior notes bear interest at 2.5%, payable semi annually in cash. We are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of 6.5% (the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance) over its expected life of seven years, resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, of approximately $39.1 million, $36.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively. In connection with this financing, we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes. These hedging transactions had a net cost to us of $83 million, which we paid from the proceeds of the notes. These transactions closed on January 31, 2008. 41In May 2008, we issued 23 million Equity Units for $1.15 billion, of which $50 million was used to pay issuance costs. Each unit consisted of a 5% interest in $1,000 principal amount of 5.6% Senior Notes due June 30, 2021 and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by June 30, 2011. During the September 2009 quarter, we completed an exchange offer for our Equity Units in the form of Corporate Units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense. We exchanged 91% of our outstanding Corporate Units, each for 0.8881 of a share of our common stock and $6.25 in cash per Corporate Unit, equating to 18.6 million shares of Legg Mason common stock and $135.0 million of cash, including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs. In connection with this transaction, we incurred transaction costs of approximately $22 million, of which $15.7 million was in cash. In June 2011, the $103.0 million of outstanding debt on the remaining 5.6% senior notes from Equity Units was retired, as part of a remarketing. Concurrently, we issued 1.8 million shares of Legg Mason common stock upon the exercise of the purchase contracts from Equity Units.During November 2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $500 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. In March 2009, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions. The facility matures on February 11, 2013.In October 2005, we borrowed $700 million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Citigroup transaction. During fiscal 2010, we repaid the remaining $550 million outstanding balance of the debt.The agreements entered into as part of our January 2008 issuance of $1.25 billion in 2.5% convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt, with a few exceptions, if our gross debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the documents) exceeds 2.5 to 1. As of March 31, 2012, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7 to 1, and thus the covenant prohibits us from borrowing additional amounts as of that date. The 2.5% convertible senior notes were extinguished in May 2012, as further described in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The financial covenants under our bank agreements include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 1 and minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio of 4.0 to 1. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding non recourse debt, and under capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $375 million. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus/minus tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expenses or losses, and any non cash charges, as defined. As of March 31, 2012, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 to 1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 13.8 to 1. We have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal 2012.If our net income significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our $250 million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. We anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt, should it be necessary. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments.Certain of our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. The interest rate on our revolving line of credit is based on the higher credit rating of the two rating agencies. In June 2011, our rating by one of these agencies was downgraded one notch below the other. Should the other agency downgrade our rating, absent an upgrade from the former agency, our interest costs will rise modestly.Other TransactionsDuring fiscal 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Permal, we paid an aggregate of $171 million in cash to acquire the remaining 62.5% of the outstanding preference shares issued by Permal and held by Permals pre acquisition owners. We also elected to purchase, for $9 million, the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to $149 million in two years. As a result of this transaction, there will be no further payments for the Permal acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we paid an aggregate amount of $7.5 million in dividends on the preference shares. All payments for preference shares, including dividends, were recognized as additional goodwill.In May 2010, we terminated the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of Legg Mason Canada Inc., in accordance with its terms. In this transaction, 1.1 million shares, representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis.Certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. Certain affiliates are 42also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements during the periods presented.See Notes 6, 7 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our financing transactions.Liquidity Fund SupportDuring fiscal 2010, four capital support agreements to provide up to $42 million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms. No amounts were drawn thereunder prior to termination and $42 million of collateral was returned.Future OutlookWe expect that over the next 12 months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs. We currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, repayment of outstanding debt, payment of increased dividends, or acquisitions.During fiscal 2012, we completed the business model streamlining initiative that began in May 2010. We incurred transition related costs of approximately $128 million through March 31, 2012, of which approximately 25% were non cash charges. Approximately $80 million of these costs have been paid to date, and substantially all of the $16.8 million remaining costs represent lease obligations to be paid over the lease terms. The initiative resulted in annual cost savings of over $140 million, which will be fully realized on an annual basis, beginning in fiscal 2013. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal 2012 and 2011.As described above, we currently project that our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2012, we had over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents in excess of our working capital requirements, a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to $155 million of our common stock during fiscal 2013, as previously discussed. We do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next 12 months, other than to refinance existing facilities. However, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, events may occur that require additional liquidity, such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events result in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, additional cost cutting, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we may seek to raise additional equity or debt.At March 31, 2012, our total cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion included $600 million held by foreign subsidiaries. Some of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to material repatriation tax effects. In a prior year, we initiated plans to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately $225 million, of which approximately $100 million had been repatriated as of March 31, 2012. Under current plans, we intend to repatriate $100 million to $150 million of foreign earnings in order to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized and to make the cash available in the U.S. All amounts planned for repatriation have been adequately provided for. No further repatriation of accumulated prior period foreign earnings beyond the above range is currently planned. However, we may repatriate future earnings to the extent required to fund domestic operations and, if tax has not previously been provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriation of these funds. It is not practical at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result from any further repatriation of foreign earnings beyond that currently planned. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for subsequent events related to our new capital plan, including $650 million issuance of 5.5% senior notes and $1.25 billion repayment of 2.5% convertible senior notes.Credit and Liquidity RiskCash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity 43or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2008, we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and Contingent PaymentsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our short and long term debt, non cancelable lease agreements, and service agreements. See Notes 6, 7, and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments.The following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year, and excludes contractual obligations of CIVs, as we are not responsible or liable for these obligations: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter TotalContractual Obligations Short term borrowings(1) $250.0 $ $ $ $ $ $250.0Long term borrowings by contract maturity(2) 1.3 1.3 1,251.4 5.9 1,259.9Interest on short term and long term borrowings(2)(3) 38.1 31.7 31.6 0.3 101.7Minimum rental and service commitments 148.2 118.1 107.9 96.4 87.7 489.3 1,047.6Total Contractual Obligations(4)(5)(6) $437.6 $151.1 $1,390.9 $102.6 $87.7 $489.3 $2,659.2(1)Represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until February 2013. However, we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose.(2)Excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated CLO of $271.7 million and interest on these long term borrowings, as applicable. (3)Interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at March 31, 2012.(4)The table above does not include approximately $36.7 million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which Legg Mason is a limited partner. These obligations will be funded, as required, through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal 2018.(5)The table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of $69.1 million (net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities), because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated.(6)The table above does not include redeemable noncontrolling interests of $24.0 million, because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated.MARKET RISKWe maintain an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of Legg Mason and its subsidiaries. Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk.Revenues and Net IncomeThe majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of securities will cause our AUM, and thus our revenues, to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business, we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing agreements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income, profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary. 44Trading and Non Trading AssetsOur trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products.Trading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2012 2011Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $111,257 $120,107Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 222,585 204,063Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 78,277 76,340Total current investments, excluding CIVs $412,119 $400,510Approximately $80.0 million and $96.0 million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity. However, it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income (expense). Trading and other current investments of $86.2 million and $72.6 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non operating income (expense) and net income.Approximately $245.9 million and $231.9 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income. Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value of approximately $12.6 million and $30.9 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements. The fluctuations in market value of approximately $11.8 million and $39.8 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy.Non trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2012 and 2011, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized (in thousands) below. 2012 2011Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Available for sale $11,913 $11,300Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other 34,965 22,167Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs 169,201 155,351Other investments 112 270Total non trading assets, excluding CIVs $216,191 $189,088Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs at March 31, 2012 and 2011, includes approximately $89.3 million and $91.9 million, respectively, of investments related to our involvement with the U.S. Treasurys Public Private Investment Program. Fluctuations in the market value of these investments have offsetting compensation expense under revenue sharing agreements.Investment securities of CIVs totaled $31.6 million and $82.8 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and investments of CIVs totaled $294.9 million and $312.8 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we held equity investments in the CIVs of $38.9 million and $53.7 million, respectively. Fluctuations in the market value of investments of CIVs in excess of our equity investment will not impact Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. However, it may have an impact on other non operating income (expense) of CIVs with a corresponding offset in net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.Valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within Critical Accounting Policies under the heading "Valuation of Financial Instruments." See Notes 1 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion 45of derivatives.The following is a summary of the effect of a 20% increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at March 31, 2012: Carrying Value Fair ValueAssuming a20% Increase(1) Fair ValueAssuming a20% Decrease(1)Investment securities, excluding CIVs: Trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans $111,257 $133,508 $89,006Trading proprietary fund products and other investments 222,585 267,102 178,068Equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments 78,277 93,932 62,622Total current investments, excluding CIVs 412,119 494,542 329,696Investments in CIVs 38,919 46,703 31,135Available for sale investments 11,913 14,296 9,530Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other 34,965 41,958 27,972Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs 169,201 203,041 135,361Other investments 112 134 90Total investments subject to market risk $667,229 $800,674 $533,784(1)Gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability. In addition, investments in proprietary fund products of approximately $11.8 million have been economically hedged to limit market risk. As a result, a 20% increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a $81.5 million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of March 31, 2012.Foreign Exchange SensitivityWe operate primarily in the United States, but provide services, earn revenues and incur expenses outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies, principally in Brazil, Poland, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom may impact our comprehensive income and net income. Certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity.Interest Rate RiskExposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as substantially all of our debt is at fixed interest rates. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $250.0 million of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income. As of March 31, 2012, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.5 million. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding debt.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESAccounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments.ConsolidationEffective April 1, 2010, we adopted revised accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810, "Consolidation," (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R)") ("SFAS No. 167"), relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") which includes a 46new approach for determining who should consolidate a VIE, changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a VIE, and changes in the assessment of which entities are VIEs. The application of the revised accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds, including money market funds. Investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46(R)").In the normal course of our business, we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles. Certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be VIEs while others are considered to be voting rights entities ("VREs") subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from these VIEs were not material at March 31, 2012. We have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these VIEs, VREs or their investors. Investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle.Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) (Accounting Standards Update 2010 10, "Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds")For most sponsored investment funds, including money market funds, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker if certain criteria are met. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders, economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us, related party ownership, guarantees and implied relationships. In determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary.Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167 (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, "Consolidation")We sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities ("CDOs") and CLOs that do not qualify for the deferral, and are assessed under the revised accounting guidance, as follows. We determine whether we have a variable interest in a VIE by considering if, among other things, we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that are expected to be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return. If we have a significant variable interest, we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that potentially could be significant to the VIE.In evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is more than insignificant.Legg Mason must consolidate VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs.Revenue RecognitionThe vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith.For most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker dealers, and others (or a 47combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition.As manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian.Valuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which is designed to approximate fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2012, equity, fixed income and liquidity AUM values aggregated $163.4 billion, $356.1 billion and $123.8 billion, respectively.As the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2012, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs.Valuation of Financial InstrumentsSubstantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except our long term debt. Trading investments, investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.For equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investees net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non operating income (expense).For investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non trading Investment securities for "other than temporary" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an "other than temporary" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined.For investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, excluding 48investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $11.9 million and $23.8 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs.At March 31, 2012 and 2011, we also have approximately $204.2 million and $177.5 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $169.2 million and $155.4 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is accounted for under the cost method, which considers if factors indicate there may be an impairment in the value of these investments. In addition, as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $78.3 million and $76.3 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non performance.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.Our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:Level 1 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets.Level 2 Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products. This category also includes CLO loans and liabilities of a CIV, and previously included certain derivative assets and liabilities of CIVs.Level 3 Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes investments in partnerships, limited liability companies and private equity funds. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and CLO debt of a CIV.The valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.Proprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at net asset value ("NAV") determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require managements judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3.The fair values of CLO loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as Level 2. Legg Mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. The fair value of CLO debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the CLOs underlying collateral assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement, the CLO debt valuation is classified as Level 3.Exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale, the last offering price. Options traded over 49the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations. Options are classified as Level 1. Futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1. Index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps previously held were valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and classified as Level 2.As a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date.As of March 31, 2012, approximately 3% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 10% of total liabilities meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 2% of total assets (13% of financial assets measured at fair value) and no liabilities meet the definition of Level 3.Any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period.See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Intangible Assets and GoodwillBalances as of March 31, 2012, are as follows:Amortizable asset management contracts $33,437Indefinite life intangible assets 3,753,629Trade names 69,800Goodwill 1,275,045 $5,131,911Our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.In allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below.For indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill, we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation/depreciation on cash flows for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our past experience, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, internal budgets, and discussions with our own market experts. Beyond five years, our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets, and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions.Goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities.Given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business, legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. At a minimum, we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31. 50We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of December 31, 2011, and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of that date. Further, no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2012, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of March 31, 2012, therefore, no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary.Amortizable Intangible AssetsIntangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are not appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.The estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to five years with a weighted average life of approximately 2.9 years.Indefinite Life Intangible AssetsFor intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participants perspective based on projected discounted cash flows. We have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names.We determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of profit margins, growth rates and discount rates. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary.Projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. Contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.The domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM") acquisition of $2,502 million account for approximately 65% of our indefinite life intangible assets and are managed primarily by ClearBridge and Western Asset. Permal funds of hedge funds contracts of $947 million account for approximately 25% of our indefinite life intangible assets. For our December 31, 2011, annual impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 7%. Cash flows on the Permal funds of hedge funds contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 9%. The projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds were discounted at 13.0% and 14.5%, respectively. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and Permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than 5% and 35%, respectively, from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to 13.5% and 19.5%, respectively, for the asset to be deemed impaired. Given the current uncertainty regarding future market conditions, it is reasonably possible that fund performance, flows and AUM levels may decrease in the near term such that actual cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts could deviate from the projections by more than 5% and the asset could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount. The approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by $124 million and $606 million, respectively.Trade names account for 2% of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts, and the resulting fair values significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts. 51GoodwillGoodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target. In December 2010, we announced a realignment of our executive management team, which during fiscal 2012, resulted in the combination of our Americas and International divisions into one operating segment, Global Asset Management. Internal management reporting has been modified consistent with this realignment such that discrete financial information regularly received by the chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, is at the consolidated Global Asset Management business level. As a result, the former Americas and International operating segments are no longer our reporting units, and subsequently, goodwill is recorded and evaluated at one Global Asset Management reporting unit level. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to business segments.Significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit, including profit margins, expected cash flow growth rates, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) and by investment manager based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources. The impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term (generally the first five years) based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions, our experience, our internal financial projections, relevant publicly available statistics and projections, and discussions with our own market experts. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.Discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk free interest rate, market risk and size premiums, peer group betas and unsystematic risk. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values.Goodwill principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM, Permal and Royce. The value of the reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our mutual funds, closed end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our managers. For our annual December 31 impairment test, the projected cash flows are discounted at 14.0% to determine the present value of cash flows. As of December 31, 2011, the implied fair value significantly exceeds the carrying value. Projected cash flows, on an aggregate basis across all asset classes, are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 8%. Cash flow growth is based on separate factors for equity, fixed income, and liquidity products. Equity product growth projections are based on long term growth experience and current market conditions. Fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business, available historical experience and market statistics, and estimates of future expectations. We believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources described above. However, our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Assuming all other factors remain the same, actual results and changes in assumptions would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate approximately 51% from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately eight percentage points for goodwill to be considered for impairment.As of December 31, 2011, considering relevant prices of our common shares, our market capitalization, along with a reasonable control premium, exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting unit.Stock Based CompensationOur stock based compensation plans include stock options, employee stock purchase plans, market based performance share awards, restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees.In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method. Also, under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows.We granted 0.8 million, 0.7 million, and 1.5 million stock options in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For additional information on share based compensation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 52We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, except for market based grants, for which we would use a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk free interest rate, all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different.Income TaxesWe are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes.These estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision.Substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. and U.K. taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2012, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $718 million, realization of which is expected to require $4.1 billion of future U.S. earnings, approximately $169 million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to $10.4 million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance of $3.4 million was recorded in fiscal 2012 with respect thereto. While tax planning may enhance our positions, the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies. As of March 31, 2012, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $237 million. Due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and, taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies, a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of $12.1 million for fiscal 2012. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary. A net release of $7.3 million in fiscal 2012 of the full valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets related to various jurisdictions, primarily the U.K. and Japan. To the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSSee discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSWe have made in this Report on Form 10 K, and from time to time may otherwise make in our public filings, press releases and 53statements by our management, "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information relating to anticipated growth in revenues, margins or earnings per share, anticipated changes in our business or in the amount of our client AUM, anticipated future performance of our business, including expected earnings per share in future periods, anticipated future investment performance of our affiliates, our expected future net client cash flows, anticipated expense levels, changes in expenses, the expected effects of acquisitions and expectations regarding financial market conditions. The words or phrases "can be," "may be," "expects," "may affect," "may depend," "believes," "estimate," "project," "anticipate" and similar words and phrases are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties and we caution readers that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of Legg Mason is not a guarantee of future performance.Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed below and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10 K and our other public filings, press releases and statements by our management. Due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, we caution each person receiving such forward looking information not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.Our future revenues may fluctuate due to numerous factors, such as: the total value and composition of our AUM; the mix of our AUM among our affiliates; the revenue yield of our AUM; the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates; the relative investment performance of company sponsored investment funds and other asset management products both in absolute terms and relative to competing offerings and market indices; investor sentiment and confidence; general economic conditions; our ability to maintain investment management and administrative fees at current levels; competitive conditions in our business; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the effects of acquisitions, including prior acquisitions. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: variations in the level of compensation expense incurred as a result of changes in the number of total employees, competitive factors, changes in the percentages of revenues paid as compensation or other reasons; variations in expenses and capital costs, including depreciation, amortization and other non cash charges incurred by us to maintain our administrative infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred by Legg Mason from time to time to protect client goodwill, to otherwise support investment products or in connection with litigation or regulatory proceedings; and the effects of acquisitions and dispositions.Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements that may have a substantial effect on our business and results of operations.EFFECTS OF INFLATIONThe rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us. Further, to the extent inflation adversely affects the securities markets, it may impact revenues and recorded intangible asset and goodwill values.
