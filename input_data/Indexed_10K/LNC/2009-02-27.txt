Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA). Interest Rate Risk With respect to accumulation and investment oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income we earn on our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract holders. If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. Provided investment yields and default experience continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long term perspective, we do not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material. The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months, asset liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period. 152 Table of Contents Significant Interest Rate Exposures The following provides a general measure of our significant interest rate risk; amounts are shown by year of maturity and include amortization of premiums and discounts; interest rate cap notional amounts are shown by amount outstanding (dollars in millions) as of December 31, 2008: Estimated 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair Value Rate Sensitive Assets Fixed interest rate securities $ 1,925 $ 2,273 $ 3,411 $ 3,617 $ 3,997 $ 38,136 $ 53,359 $ 47,761 Average interest rate 6.0 % 6.1 % 6.2 % 6.0 % 5.9 % 6.2 % 6.1 % Variable interest rate securities $ 46 $ 153 $ 149 $ 48 $ 228 $ 5,837 $ 6,461 $ 3,507 Average interest rate 7.9 % 5.9 % 3.2 % 5.7 % 5.8 % 5.4 % 5.4 % Mortgage loans $ 266 $ 261 $ 366 $ 496 $ 455 $ 5,833 $ 7,677 $ 7,424 Average interest rate 7.5 % 7.0 % 7.7 % 6.8 % 6.2 % 6.3 % 6.5 % Rate Sensitive Liabilities Investment type insurance contracts (1) $ 1,032 $ 1,153 $ 1,794 $ 1,813 $ 1,942 $ 15,534 $ 23,268 $ 26,058 Average interest rate 5.7 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.0 % 5.9 % 6.1 % 6.1 % Debt $ 815 $ 250 $ 250 $ 300 $ 200 $ 3,555 $ 5,370 $ 3,684 Average interest rate 1.5 % 2.2 % 6.2 % 5.7 % 1.6 % 5.9 % 4.9 % Rate Sensitive Derivative Financial Instruments Interest rate and foreign currency swaps: Pay variable/receive fixed $ 146 $ 24 $ 68 $ $ 258 $ 5,112 $ 5,608 $ 1,776 Average pay rate 2.8 % 3.2 % 2.4 % 0.0 % 3.4 % 3.3 % 3.3 % Average receive rate 6.5 % 4.2 % 4.1 % 0.0 % 4.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % Pay fixed/receive variable $ $ 554 $ 405 $ 510 $ 275 $ 1,928 $ 3,672 $ (568 ) Average pay rate 0.0 % 4.9 % 3.6 % 5.0 % 4.0 % 5.1 % 4.8 % Average receive rate 0.0 % 2.4 % 3.3 % 2.7 % 2.5 % 3.0 % 2.9 % Interest rate caps: Outstanding notional $ 1,000 $ 150 $ $ $ $ $ $ Average strike rate (2) 7.0 % 7.0 % Forward CMT curve (3) 2.3 % 2.6 % Interest rate futures: 2 year treasury notes outstanding notional $ 634 $ $ $ $ $ $ 634 $ 5 year treasury notes outstanding notional 743 743 10 year treasury notes outstanding notional 671 671 Treasury bonds outstanding notional 6,522 6,522 (1) The information shown is for our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans that support these insurance contracts.

Should interest rates remain at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity and UL investment portfolios will continue to decline. Declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%, with an average guaranteed rate of approximately 4%. The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the December 31, 2008, interest rates being credited to contract holders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (dollars in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses: Account Values Insurance Percent Retirement Solutions Solutions of Total Defined Life Account Annuities Contribution Insurance Total Values Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums CD and on benefit type annuities $ 10,425 $ 1,864 $ $ 12,289 22.61 % Discretionary rate setting products (1) No difference 3,298 7,237 12,075 22,610 41.60 % up to .10% 1,462 74 4,147 5,683 10.45 % 0.11% to .20% 790 2 2,640 3,432 6.31 % 0.21% to .30% 137 5 859 1,001 1.84 % 0.31% to .40% 126 1 561 688 1.27 % 0.41% to .50% 74 1,113 1,196 2,383 4.39 % 0.51% to .60% 38 125 1,021 1,184 2.18 % 0.61% to .70% 268 2 440 710 1.31 % 0.71% to .80% 7 560 567 1.04 % 0.81% to .90% 9 364 373 0.69 % 0.91% to 1.0% 5 36 632 673 1.24 % 1.01% to 1.50% 48 149 290 487 0.90 % 1.51% to 2.00% 438 205 645 1,288 2.37 % 2.01% to 2.50% 278 232 510 0.94 % 2.51% to 3.00% 176 14 190 0.35 % 3.01% and above 73 194 8 275 0.51 % Total discretionary rate setting products 7,227 9,157 25,670 42,054 77.39 % Total account values $ 17,652 $ 11,021 $ 25,670 $ 54,343 100.00 % (1) Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary. The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio. 155 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business Rising Rates For both annuities and UL, a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances. Debt We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise. See Note 13 for additional information on our debt. Derivatives We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Foreign Currency Denominated Investments We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar Denominated (USD) securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds. See Note 6 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) as of December 31, 2008, by expected maturity for our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps: Estimated 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair Value Currencies British pound $ 73 $ 55 $ 58 $ 28 $ 25 $ 626 $ 865 $ 851 Interest rate 5.80 % 5.20 % 6.60 % 7.00 % 4.00 % 5.90 % 5.90 % Canadian dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 35 $ 35 $ 31 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 5.98 % 5.98 % New Zealand dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 25 $ 25 $ 23 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 7.50 % 7.50 % Euro $ $ $ $ $ $ 195 $ 195 $ 172 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 4.88 % 4.88 % Australian dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 34 $ 34 $ 19 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 7.40 % 7.40 % Total currencies $ 73 $ 55 $ 58 $ 28 $ 25 $ 915 $ 1,154 $ 1,096 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps 367 367 64 156 Table of Contents The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents of our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps (in millions): As of December 31, 2007 Principal/ Notional Estimated Amount Fair Value Currencies British pound $ 1,152 $ 1,220 Canadian dollar 53 54 New Zealand dollar 33 31 Euro 205 198 Australian dollar 43 29 Total currencies $ 1,486 $ 1,532 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ 366 $ (17 ) Equity Market Risk Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (RTM) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), deferred sales inducements (DSI) and deferred front end sales loads (DFEL). However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to our Item 7. MDA Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL for further discussion on the impact of equity markets on our RTM. Fee Revenues The fee revenues of our Investment Management segment and fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers. 157 Table of Contents Assets While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments.

Estimated fair value does not reflect daily settlement of futures or monthly settlement of total return swaps. Liabilities We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights (SARs) issued in 2002 through 2008. See Note 6 and Note 20 for additional information on our SARs and the related call options used to hedge the expected increase in liabilities from SARs granted on our stock. Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Such derivatives include over the counter equity call options, equity collars, variance swaps, total return swaps, put options, equity futures and call options. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. 158 Table of Contents Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies as described in MDA Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long term equity market assumptions based upon short term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The following presents our estimate of the annual, after tax, after DAC, impact on income from operations (in millions), from the level of the SP 500 remaining at 800 and 700 for the entire year at a 9% growth rate, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change: SP 500 SP 500 at 800(2) at 700(2) Segment Retirement Solutions Annuities (1) $ (68 ) $ (172 ) Retirement Solutions Defined Contribution (7 ) (12 ) Investment Management (5 ) (10 ) (1) The Annuities amounts reflect a one time DAC retrospective unlocking of $29 million, after tax, for SP 800, and $44 million, after tax, for SP 700. (2) The impact of SP 500 at 800 and 700, respectively, assumes the index remained at those levels for the entire year. The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected annual effect. The result of the above factors should be multiplied by 25% to arrive at an estimated quarterly effect. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter due to the fact that fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index. Default Risk Our portfolio of invested assets was $67.3 billion and $71.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. Of this total, $38.3 billion and $46.1 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $7.7 billion and $7.4 billion consist of commercial mortgages as of December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower quality, higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality. Additional diversification limits, such as limits per industry, are also applied. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing. We depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above. Credit Related Derivatives We use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. For additional information see Note 6. 159 Table of Contents Credit Risk By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us. We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $562 million and $781 million, respectively. Of this exposure, $145 million and $567 million, respectively was related to our program to hedge our variable annuity guaranteed benefits. We have exposure to 19 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $153 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long standing, superior performance records. For the majority of LNC counterparties, there is a termination event should long term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB /Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows: As of December 31, 2008 2007 Rating AAA $ 20 $ 3 AA 333 651 A 209 127 Total $ 562 $ 781 160 Table of Contents
