For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, there were no shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs. 45 (2) On February 23, 2007, our Board approved a $2 billion increase to our existing securities repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization at that time to $2.6 billion. At December 31, 2009, our security repurchase authorization was $1.2 billion. The security repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. However, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced a suspension of share repurchased under this program. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. The shares repurchased in connection with the awards described in footnote (1) are not included in our security repurchase. As required under the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program, repurchases of the Companys outstanding preferred and common stock are subject to certain restrictions (unless the U.S. Treasury consents). In addition to these restrictions, in connection with this arrangement, the Company will comply with enhanced compensation restrictions for certain executives and employees.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the financial condition as of December 31, 2009, compared with December 31, 2008, and the results of operations in 2009 and 2008, compared with the immediately preceding year of Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, LNC, Lincoln, Company, we, our or us refers to Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). Interest Rate Risk With respect to accumulation and investment oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income we earn on our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract holders. If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. Provided investment yields and default experience continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long term perspective, we do not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material. The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months, asset liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid increase in interest rates. 150 Significant Interest Rate Exposures The following provides a general measure of our significant interest rate risk; amounts are shown by year of maturity and include amortization of premiums and discounts; interest rate cap notional amounts are shown by amount outstanding (dollars in millions) as of December 31, 2009: Estimated 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Fair Value Rate Sensitive Assets Fixed interest rate securities $ 1,886 $ 3,025 $ 3,306 $ 3,694 $ 3,679 $ 43,177 $ 58,767 $ 58,984 Average interest rate 6.2 % 6.0 % 5.9 % 5.8 % 6.1 % 6.0 % 6.0 % Variable interest rate securities $ 166 $ 125 $ 64 $ 215 $ 314 $ 5,135 $ 6,019 $ 4,337 Average interest rate 8.1 % 3.8 % 7.6 % 4.9 % 3.2 % 4.6 % 4.6 % Mortgage loans $ 223 $ 349 $ 475 $ 425 $ 495 $ 5,205 $ 7,172 $ 7,316 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.7 % 6.8 % 6.2 % 6.2 % 6.3 % 6.4 % Rate Sensitive Liabilities Investment type insurance contracts (1) $ 1,162 $ 1,695 $ 1,798 $ 1,979 $ 2,337 $ 17,567 $ 26,538 $ 26,319 Average interest rate 6.0 % 6.3 % 6.0 % 5.8 % 5.9 % 6.0 % 6.0 % Debt $ 350 $ 250 $ 300 $ 200 $ 500 $ 3,768 $ 5,368 $ 5,108 Average interest rate 0.3 % 6.2 % 5.7 % 2.0 % 4.8 % 6.4 % 5.6 % Rate Sensitive Derivative Financial Instruments Interest rate and foreign currency swaps: Pay variable/receive fixed $ 24 $ 24 $ $ 66 $ $ 3,150 $ 3,264 $ (40 ) Average pay rate 0.3 % 0.9 % 0.0 % 0.9 % 0.0 % 0.5 % 0.5 % Average receive rate 4.2 % 4.5 % 0.0 % 5.2 % 0.0 % 4.4 % 4.4 % Pay fixed/receive variable $ 395 $ 203 $ 758 $ 275 $ 503 $ 1,830 $ 3,964 $ (213 ) Average pay rate 4.8 % 4.0 % 3.0 % 4.0 % 3.4 % 4.6 % 4.1 % Average receive rate 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.3 % Interest rate caps: Outstanding notional $ 150 $ $ $ $ $ $ 150 $ Average strike rate (2) 7.0 % Forward CMT curve (3) 3.8 % Interest rate futures: 2 year treasury notes outstanding notional $ 287 $ $ $ $ $ $ 287 $ 5 year treasury notes outstanding notional 224 224 10 year treasury notes outstanding notional 376 376 Treasury bonds outstanding notional 1,446 1,446 (1) The information shown is for our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans that support these insurance contracts.

Should interest rates remain at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity and UL investment portfolios will continue to decline. Declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%. The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the December 31, 2009, interest rates being credited to contract holders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (dollars in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses: Account Values Insurance Retirement Solutions Solutions % Defined Life Account Annuities Contribution Insurance Total Values Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums CD and on benefit type annuities $ 12,960 $ 1,951 $ $ 14,911 25.72 % Discretionary rate setting products (1) No difference 4,887 7,889 19,988 32,764 56.50 % up to .10% 203 199 402 0.69 % 0.11% to .20% 213 4 1,029 1,246 2.15 % 0.21% to .30% 308 165 552 1,025 1.77 % 0.31% to .40% 94 74 650 818 1.41 % 0.41% to .50% 35 939 684 1,658 2.86 % 0.51% to .60% 20 337 357 0.62 % 0.61% to .70% 11 985 996 1.72 % 0.71% to .80% 10 1 843 854 1.47 % 0.81% to .90% 10 10 0.02 % 0.91% to 1.0% 12 158 20 190 0.33 % 1.01% to 1.50% 159 193 526 878 1.51 % 1.51% to 2.00% 506 93 542 1,141 1.97 % 2.01% to 2.50% 299 4 303 0.52 % 2.51% to 3.00% 180 12 192 0.33 % 3.01% and above 31 189 19 239 0.41 % Total discretionary rate setting products 6,978 9,717 26,378 43,073 74.28 % Total account values $ 19,938 $ 11,668 $ 26,378 $ 57,984 100.00 % (1) Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary. The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio. 153 Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business Rising Rates For both annuities and UL, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances. Debt We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise. See Note 13 for additional information on our debt. Derivatives We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy. 154 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Foreign Currency Denominated Investments We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar Denominated (USD) securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds. See Note 6 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) as of December 31, 2009, by expected maturity for our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps: Estimated 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Fair Value Currencies British pound $ $ $ $ $ $ 69 $ 69 $ 69 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 6.20 % 6.20 % Canadian dollar $ $ $ $ $ 31 $ 10 $ 41 $ 41 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 6.10 % 5.60 % 6.00 % New Zealand dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 31 $ 31 $ 32 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 3.70 % 3.70 % Euro $ $ $ $ $ 74 $ 99 $ 173 $ 167 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 4.80 % 5.00 % 4.90 % Australian dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 33 $ 33 $ 28 Interest rate 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 7.40 % 7.40 % Total currencies $ $ $ $ $ 105 $ 242 $ 347 $ 337 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ $ $ $ $ 94 $ 246 $ 340 14 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents of our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps (in millions): As of December 31, 2008 Principal/ Notional Estimated Amount Fair Value Currencies British pound $ 61 $ 58 Canadian dollar 35 31 New Zealand dollar 25 23 Euro 195 172 Australian dollar 34 19 Total currencies $ 350 $ 303 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ 367 $ 64 155 Equity Market Risk Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (RTM) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), deferred sales inducements (DSI) and deferred front end sales loads (DFEL). However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to our Item 7. MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL for further discussion on the impact of equity markets on our RTM. Fee Revenues The fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers. Assets While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments. The following provides the sensitivity of price changes (in millions) to our equity assets owned and equity derivatives: As of December 31, 2009 As of December 31, 2008 10% Fair 10% Fair Carrying Estimated Value Value Carrying Estimated Value Fair Value Increase Decrease Value Fair Value Equity Assets Domestic equities $ 219 $ 219 $ 241 $ 197 $ 210 $ 210 Foreign equities 61 61 67 55 46 46 Subtotal 280 280 308 252 256 256 Real estate 174 195 215 176 125 149 Other equity interests 888 898 988 808 984 994 Total $ 1,342 $ 1,373 $ 1,511 $ 1,236 $ 1,365 $ 1,399 As of December 31, 2009 As of December 31, 2008 10% Fair 10% Fair Notional Estimated Value Value Notional Estimated Value Fair Value Increase Decrease Value Fair Value Equity Derivatives (1) Equity futures $ 1,147 $ $ (112 ) $ 112 $ 3,769 $ Total return swaps 156 9 (9 ) 126 Put options 4,093 935 859 1,040 4,700 1,727 S&P 500 options 3,440 215 314 117 2,951 31 Total $ 8,836 $ 1,150 $ 1,070 $ 1,260 $ 11,546 $ 1,758 (1) Assumes a plus or minus 10% change in underlying indexes. Estimated fair value does not reflect daily settlement of futures or monthly settlement of total return swaps. 156 Liabilities We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights (SARs) issued in 2005 through 2009. See Note 6 and Note 20 for additional information on our SARs and the related call options used to hedge the expected increase in liabilities from SARs granted on our stock. Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Such derivatives include over the counter equity call options, equity collars, variance swaps, total return swaps, put options, equity futures and call options. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies as described in MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long term equity market assumptions based upon short term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The following table presents our estimate of the impact on income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset based fees and related expenses, if the level of the S&P 500 Index (S&P 500) were to drop to 1000 immediately after December 31, 2009, and remaining at that level through the next twelve months or dropped to 800 immediately after December 31, 2009, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change: S&P 500 S&P 500 at 1000 (2) at 800 (2) Segment Retirement Solutions Annuities (1) $ (69 ) $ (133 ) Retirement Solutions Defined Contribution (8 ) (26 ) (1) If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 800 immediately after December 31, 2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods, we project that we would have an RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $200 million to $240 million, after tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2012. If the level of the S&P 500 dropped to 1000 immediately after December 31, 2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods, we project that we would have an RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $125 million to $165 million, after tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2014. (2) The baseline for these impacts assumes 9% annual equity market growth beginning on January 1, 2010. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 800 and 1000 levels, which assume the index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 800 and 1000 level scenarios is presented in the table. The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index. 157 Default Risk Our portfolio of invested assets was $75.9 billion and $66.5 billion as of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. Of this total, $47.2 billion and $37.7 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $7.2 billion and $7.7 billion consist of commercial mortgages as of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower quality, higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality. Additional diversification limits, such as limits per industry, are also applied. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing. We depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above. Credit Related Derivatives We use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. For additional information see Note 6. Credit Risk By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us. We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $292 million and $562 million, respectively. We have exposure to 15 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $135 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long standing, superior performance records. For the majority of LNC counterparties, there is a termination event should long term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB /Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement. Our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows: As of December 31, 2009 2008 Rating AAA $ $ 20 AA 202 333 A 82 209 BBB 8 BB and below investment grade Total $ 292 $ 562 158
