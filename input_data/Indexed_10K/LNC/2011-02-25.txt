Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). Interest Rate Risk With respect to accumulation and investment oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income we earn on our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract holders. If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. Provided investment yields and default experience continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long term perspective, we do not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material. The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months, asset liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid increase in interest rates. 142 Significant Interest Rate Exposures The following provides a general measure of our significant interest rate risk; amounts are shown by year of maturity and include amortization of premiums and discounts; interest rate cap agreements notional amounts are shown by amount outstanding (dollars in millions) as of December 31, 2010: Estimated 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value Rate Sensitive Assets Fixed interest rate securities $ 2,446 $ 2,764 $ 3,391 $ 3,486 $ 2,912 $ 48,992 $ 63,991 $ 67,021 Average interest rate 6.1% 5.8% 5.7% 6.1% 5.4% 5.8% 5.8% Variable interest rate securities $ 70 $ 47 $ 132 $ 236 $ 89 $ 4,540 $ 5,114 $ 4,187 Average interest rate 0.6% 7.5% 5.1% 3.6% 7.4% 4.5% 4.5% Mortgage loans $ 286 $ 332 $ 403 $ 443 $ 659 $ 4,622 $ 6,745 $ 7,183 Average interest rate 7.6% 6.9% 6.2% 6.2% 6.1% 6.3% 6.3% Rate Sensitive Liabilities Investment type insurance contracts (1) $ 1,411 $ 1,518 $ 1,852 $ 2,225 $ 1,752 $ 19,329 $ 28,087 $ 29,166 Average interest rate (1) 6.1% 5.9% 5.8% 5.9% 5.5% 5.7% 5.7% Debt $ 351 $ 300 $ 200 $ 500 $ 250 $ 4,114 $ 5,715 $ 5,876 Average interest rate 4.6% 5.7% 2.0% 4.8% 4.3% 6.5% 5.9% Rate Sensitive Derivative Financial Instruments Interest rate and foreign currency swaps: Pay variable/receive fixed $ 24 $ 300 $ 45 $ 500 $ 85 $ 5,085 $ 6,039 $ (106) Average pay rate 0.7% 4.2% 1.0% 2.5% 1.0% 0.8% 1.1% Average receive rate 4.5% 5.7% 5.6% 4.8% 2.9% 4.0% 4.2% Pay fixed/receive variable $ 203 $ 583 $ 473 $ 503 $ 214 $ 2,691 $ 4,667 $ (362) Average pay rate 4.0% 3.4% 2.8% 3.4% 4.4% 4.6% 4.1% Average receive rate 0.3% 0.3% 0.3% 0.3% 0.3% 0.6% 0.5% Interest rate cap agreements: Contractual notional $ 150 $ $ $ $ $ 8,050 $ 8,200 $ 51 Average strike rate (2) 7.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 7.8% 7.8% Forward CMT curve (3) 3.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 5.0% 5.0% Interest rate futures: 2 year treasury notes contractual notional $ 740 $ $ $ $ $ $ 740 $ 5 year treasury notes contractual notional 341 341 10 year treasury notes contractual notional 247 247 Treasury bonds contractual notional 924 924 (1) The information shown is for our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans on real estate that support these insurance contracts.

Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses Falling Rates In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbate this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this threat and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue. In addition, interest rates have recently been on the rise. The following summarizes solely a hypothetical significant unfavorable stress scenario to earnings if new money rates, currently averaging approximately 50 to 75 basis points below our portfolio yields, remain in place through 2012 as opposed to a scenario that we would expect to occur. This scenario is simply an illustration of the sensitivity to our earnings if such a stress scenario were to happen: Insurance Solutions Life Insurance The stress on earnings has been mitigated by proactive strategies to lock in long dated and high yielding assets. We executed on strategies which allowed us to effectively pre buy assets in anticipation of future flows and maturing securities. We have also taken actions on crediting rates. We estimate the spread compression would have no effect on 2011 earnings and would unfavorably affect earnings by approximately $15 million during 2012 and $30 million during 2013. We pursue proactive strategies to lock in long dated and high yielding assets to manage this risk. Our methodology assumes that new money rates grade from current levels to a long term yield assumption over time. During the third quarter of 2010, we lowered our new money investment yield assumption to reflect the then current new money rates and to approximate the forward curve for interest rates relevant at such time. The result was a drop in the current new money investment rate followed by a gradual annual recovery over eight years to a rate of 6.31%, 54 basis points below our previous ultimate long term assumption of 6.85%. As a result, we recorded a prospective unlocking, as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and Results of Insurance Solutions Life Insurance in the MD&A. Retirement Solutions The earnings drag from spread compression is modest and largely concentrated in our Defined Contribution segment, which is a function of this segment having higher guaranteed crediting rates and recurring premiums. We estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of $0 to $5 million during 2011, $0 to $5 million during 2012 and $5 million to $10 million during 2013. Since we currently have the ability to manage spread compression through credit rate actions, our Annuities business is not currently sensitive to spread compression so there is very little effect estimated. The risk for our Annuities business is sensitivity to sharp rising rates and we manage this risk by selling market value adjusted product and through purchase of derivative protection. Insurance Solutions Group Protection The earnings effect is minimal as we reviewed the discount rate assumptions associated with our long term disability claim reserves during the third quarter of 2010, which resulted in lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points and decreasing income from operations by $2 million. Spread compression would unfavorably affect annualized earnings by up to $5 million during 2011. Other Operations We may also be affected by sensitivity to our exposures in our institutional pension and disability run off blocks of business that are sensitive to interest rates and could contribute to an effect. 144 The estimates above are based upon a hypothetical stressed scenario and are only representative of the effects of new money rates remaining in place through 2012 keeping all else equal and does not give consideration to the aggregate effect of other factors, including but not limited to: contract holder activity; hedge positions; changing equity markets; shifts in implied volatilities; and changes in other capital market sectors. In addition, the scenario only illustrated the effect to spreads and certain unlocking and reserve changes. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and universal life (UL) policies generally range from 0.6% to 5.0%. Other potential effects of the scenario were not considered in the analysis. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals for additional information on interest rates. The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the December 31, 2010, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on fourth quarter of 2010 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (dollars in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses: Account Values Insurance Retirement Solutions Solutions % Defined Life Account Annuities Contribution Insurance (1) Total Values Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums Discretionary rate setting products (2)(3) No difference $ 4,823 $ 8,891 $ 22,707 $ 36,421 59.7% up to .10% 66 29 567 662 1.1% 0.11% to .20% 22 7 153 182 0.3% 0.21% to .30% 252 23 186 461 0.8% 0.31% to .40% 16 1 390 407 0.7% 0.41% to .50% 39 2 700 741 1.2% 0.51% to .60% 64 698 762 1.3% 0.61% to .70% 13 176 437 626 1.0% 0.71% to .80% 41 304 345 0.6% 0.81% to .90% 10 272 282 0.5% 0.91% to 1.0% 33 275 137 445 0.7% 1.01% to 1.50% 537 92 440 1,069 1.8% 1.51% to 2.00% 329 6 51 386 0.6% 2.01% to 2.50% 206 148 354 0.6% 2.51% to 3.00% 43 18 110 171 0.3% 3.01% and above 8 19 27 0.0% Total discretionary rate setting products 6,502 9,687 27,152 43,341 71.2% Other contracts (4) 14,450 3,092 17,542 28.8% Total account values $ 20,952 $ 12,779 $ 27,152 $ 60,883 100.0% Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account values at minimum guaranteed rates 74.2% 91.8% 83.6% 84.0% (1) Excludes policy loans. (2) Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary. (3) The average crediting rates in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Defined Contribution and Life Insurance segments were 32 basis points, 10 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively. (4) Includes multi year guarantee annuities, indexed annuities, modified guarantee annuities, single premium immediate annuities, dollar cost averaging contracts and indexed based rate setting products for our Defined Contribution segment. The average crediting rates in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for indexed based rate setting products within our Defined Contribution segment was 36 basis points, and 47% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these 145 exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio. Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses Rising Rates For both annuities and UL, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from 1 to 10 years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse effect of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances. Debt We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise. See Note 13 for additional information on our debt. Derivatives We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate futures, interest rate cap agreements, forward starting interest rate swaps, consumer price index swaps, interest rate cap corridors and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Foreign Currency Denominated Investments We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar Denominated securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds. See Note 6 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. 146 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) as of December 31, 2010, by expected maturity for our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps: Estimated 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value Currencies British pound $ $ $ $ $ $ 66 $ 66 $ 70 Interest rate 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 6.20% 6.20% Canadian dollar $ $ $ $ 33 $ $ 10 $ 43 $ 45 Interest rate 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 6.10% 0.00% 5.60% 6.00% New Zealand dollar $ $ $ $ $ 34 $ $ 34 $ 35 Interest rate 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 3.70% 0.00% 3.70% Euro $ $ $ $ 70 $ $ 92 $ 162 $ 163 Interest rate 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 4.80% 0.00% 5.00% 4.90% Australian dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 38 $ 38 $ 34 Interest rate 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 7.40% 7.40% Total currencies $ $ $ $ 103 $ 34 $ 206 $ 343 $ 347 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ $ $ $ 94 $ 30 $ 216 $ 340 $ 30 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents of our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps (in millions): As of December 31, 2009 Principal/ Notional Estimated Amount Fair Value Currencies British pound $ 69 $ 69 Canadian dollar 41 41 New Zealand dollar 31 32 Euro 173 167 Australian dollar 33 28 Total currencies $ 347 $ 337 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ 340 $ 14 Equity Market Risk Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (RTM) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), deferred sales inducements (DSI) and deferred front end sales loads (DFEL). However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL in the MD&A for further discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM. Fee Revenues The fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers. 147 Assets While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments.

Estimated fair value does not reflect daily settlement of futures or monthly settlement of total return swaps. Liabilities We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights (SARs) issued in 2007 through 2010. See Note 6 and Note 20 for additional information on our SARs and the related call options used to hedge the expected increase in liabilities from SARs granted on our stock. Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Such derivatives include over the counter equity call options, equity collars, variance swaps, total return swaps, put options, equity futures and call options. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies as described in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the MD&A, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long term equity market assumptions based upon short term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an effect to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The following table presents our estimate of the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions), from the change in asset based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 Index (S&P 500) were to decrease to 800 148 over 6 months after December 31, 2010, and remain at that level through the next 6 months, excluding any effect related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change: S&P 500 at 800 (1) Segment Retirement Solutions Annuities $ (138) Retirement Solutions Defined Contribution (18) (1) The baseline for these effects assumes 9% annual separate account growth beginning on January 1, 2011. The baseline is then compared to a scenario of the S&P 500 at the 800 level, which assumes the index moves to the level as noted above and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 800 level scenario is presented. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL in the MD&A for discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM. The effect on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index. Default Risk Our portfolio of invested assets was $83.3 billion and $75.9 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of this total, $53.5 billion and $47.1 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion consisted of commercial mortgages as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower quality, higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality. Additional diversification limits, such as limits per industry, are also applied. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing. We depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above. Credit Related Derivatives We use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Credit Risk Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us. 149 We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $184 million and $292 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, we had exposure to 17 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $43 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long standing, superior performance records. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long term senior debt ratings of Lincoln National Corporation drop below BBB /Baa3 (S&P/Moodys). Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement. Our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows: As of December 31, 2010 2009 Rating AAA $ 7 $ AA 26 202 A 146 82 BBB 5 8 Total $ 184 $ 292 150
