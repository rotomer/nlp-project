Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). Interest Rate Risk With respect to accumulation and investment oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income we earn on our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract holders. If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next 12 months, asset liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender all work together to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid increase in interest rates. 111 Significant Interest Rate Exposures The following provides a general measure of our significant interest rate risk; amounts are shown by year of maturity and include amortization of premiums and discounts; interest rate cap agreements notional amounts are shown by amount outstanding (dollars in millions) as of December 31, 2011: Estimated 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value Rate Sensitive Assets Fixed interest rate securities $ 2,501 $ 3,206 $ 3,319 $ 2,820 $ 3,296 $ 52,903 $ 68,045 $ 75,027 Average interest rate 5.9 % 5.8 % 6.2 % 5.4 % 5.4 % 5.6 % 5.6 % Variable interest rate securities $ 45 $ 44 $ 267 $ 89 $ 241 $ 3,973 $ 4,659 $ 3,778 Average interest rate 7.8 % 5.6 % 2.7 % 7.3 % 10.2 % 4.6 % 4.8 % Mortgage loans on real estate $ 309 $ 379 $ 402 $ 622 $ 518 $ 4,730 $ 6,960 $ 7,608 Average interest rate 7.2 % 6.2 % 6.1 % 6.0 % 6.1 % 6.0 % 6.1 % Rate Sensitive Liabilities Investment type insurance contracts (1) $ 1,410 $ 1,863 $ 2,276 $ 1,863 $ 2,141 $ 22,624 $ 32,177 $ 34,542 Average interest rate (1) 5.9 % 5.9 % 5.9 % 5.4 % 5.1 % 5.4 % 5.5 % Debt $ 300 $ 200 $ 500 $ 250 $ $ 4,138 $ 5,388 $ 5,334 Average interest rate 5.7 % 2.0 % 4.8 % 4.3 % 0.0 % 6.3 % 5.9 % Rate Sensitive Derivative Financial Instruments Interest rate and foreign currency swaps: Pay variable/receive fixed $ 300 $ 20 $ 500 $ 85 $ $ 9,824 $ 10,729 $ 1,362 Average pay rate 4.4 % 0.7 % 2.7 % 1.2 % 0.0 % 0.7 % 0.9 % Average receive rate 5.7 % 4.3 % 4.8 % 2.9 % 0.0 % 3.4 % 3.6 % Pay fixed/receive variable $ 583 $ 473 $ 503 $ 214 $ 418 $ 2,253 $ 4,444 $ (713 ) Average pay rate 3.4 % 2.8 % 3.4 % 4.4 % 2.9 % 4.8 % 4.1 % Average receive rate 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.8 % 0.6 % Interest rate cap agreements: Contractual notional $ $ $ $ $ 8,050 $ 8,625 $ 16,675 $ 31 Average strike rate (2) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 7.8 % 7.0 % 7.4 % Forward CMT curve (3) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.1 % Interest rate futures: 2 year treasury notes contractual notional $ 310 $ $ $ $ $ $ 310 $ 5 year treasury notes contractual notional 369 369 10 year treasury notes contractual notional 216 216 Treasury bonds contractual notional 76 76 (1) The information shown is for our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans on real estate that support these insurance contracts.

Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses Falling Rates In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbate this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this threat and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue. The following summarizes a hypothetical stress scenario related to the effect of continued low new money rates relative to our portfolio yields. The scenario assumes modest improvements in our new money rates from the current average of approximately 125 to 150 basis points below our portfolio yields, which would result in spreads in our businesses declining from 2011 levels. Life Insurance The stress on earnings has been mitigated by proactive strategies to lock in long dated and high yielding assets to manage this risk. We executed on strategies which allowed us to effectively pre buy assets in anticipation of future flows and maturing securities. We have also taken actions on crediting rates. We estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of $15 million to $20 million during 2012, $40 million to $45 million during 2013 and $65 million to $70 million during 2014. Our deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and deferred front end loads (DFEL) methodology assumes that new money rates grade from current levels to a long term yield assumption over time. Retirement Plan Services and Annuities The earnings drag from spread compression is modest and largely concentrated in our Retirement Plan Services segment, which is a function of this segment having higher guaranteed crediting rates and recurring premiums. We estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of $10 million to $15 million during 2012, $20 million to $25 million during 2013 and $30 million to $35 million during 2014. Since we currently have the ability to manage spread compression through crediting rate actions, our Annuities segment is not currently sensitive to spread compression so there is very little effect estimated. The risk for our Annuities segment is sensitivity to sharp rising rates, and we manage this risk by selling market value adjusted products and purchasing derivative protection. The costs of our derivative instruments that we use to hedge our variable annuity products may increase as a result of the low interest rate environment. Group Protection We reviewed the discount rate assumptions associated with our long term disability claim reserves and life waiver claim incurrals during the fourth quarter of 2011, which resulted in no change to the discount rate. Spread compression would unfavorably affect annualized earnings by up to $5 million during 2012, $7 million during 2013 and $10 million during 2014. Other Operations We may also be affected by sensitivity to our exposures in our institutional pension and disability run off blocks of business that are sensitive to interest rates and could contribute to an effect. 113 We believe that applying this same hypothetical scenario to statutory earnings would produce similar percentage changes to earnings effects to those disclosed above. In isolation, we believe the effects to our balance sheet from sustained low interest rates under this scenario would be modest assuming no changes to our long term yield assumption and also excluding the effects of the new DAC methodology discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL New DAC Methodology. With regard to our goodwill balance, low interest rates generally support a lower discount rate and therefore a higher goodwill implied fair value. The estimates above are based upon a hypothetical stressed scenario and are only representative of the effects of new money rates remaining in place through 2013 keeping all else equal and does not give consideration to the aggregate effect of other factors, including but not limited to: contract holder activity; hedge positions; changing equity markets; shifts in implied volatilities; and changes in other capital market sectors. In addition, the scenario only illustrated the effect to spreads and certain unlocking and reserve changes. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and universal life (UL) policies generally range from 0.0% to 4.1%. Other potential effects of the scenario were not considered in the analysis. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals for additional information on interest rates. The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the December 31, 2011, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on fourth quarter of 2011 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments: Account Values Retirement % Plan Life Account Annuities Services Insurance (1) Total Values Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums Discretionary rate setting products (2)(3) No difference $ 6,465 $ 9,223 $ 24,047 $ 39,735 65.0 % Up to 0.10% 64 207 12 283 0.5 % 0.11% to 0.20% 75 75 0.1 % 0.21% to 0.30% 113 75 455 643 1.1 % 0.31% to 0.40% 80 1 81 0.1 % 0.41% to 0.50% 95 52 629 776 1.3 % 0.51% to 0.60% 109 25 134 0.2 % 0.61% to 0.70% 115 10 258 383 0.6 % 0.71% to 0.80% 101 140 241 0.4 % 0.81% to 0.90% 78 127 205 0.3 % 0.91% to 1.00% 46 156 245 447 0.7 % 1.01% to 1.50% 223 25 52 300 0.5 % 1.51% to 2.00% 23 158 181 0.3 % 2.01% to 2.50% 1 61 62 0.1 % 2.51% to 3.00% 10 113 123 0.2 % 3.01% and above 1 1 0.0 % Total discretionary rate setting products 7,598 9,969 26,103 43,670 71.4 % Other contracts (4) 13,828 3,661 17,489 28.6 % Total account values $ 21,426 $ 13,630 $ 26,103 $ 61,159 100.0 % Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account values at minimum guaranteed rates 85.1 % 92.5 % 92.1 % 91.0 % (1) Excludes policy loans. (2) Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary. (3) The average crediting rates for discretionary rate setting products were 10 basis points, 7 basis points and 6 basis points in 114 excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively. (4) For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to multi year guarantee and indexed renewal business. The average crediting rates were 193 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for multi year guarantee products; 23%, 8% and 69% of our total multi year guarantee account values are scheduled to reset in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and beyond, respectively. Our indexed renewal business resets either annually or bi annually. Upon reset, we are able to adjust product features to reflect changes in option prices. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates to indexed based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 7 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates and 78% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio. Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses Rising Rates For both annuities and UL, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from 1 to 10 years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse effect of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances. Debt We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise. See Note 13 for additional information on our debt. Derivatives See Note 6 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Foreign Currency Denominated Investments We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar Denominated securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds. See Note 6 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. 115 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) as of December 31, 2011, by expected maturity for our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps: Estimated 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value Currencies British pound $ $ $ $ $ $ 66 $ 66 $ 81 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 4.2 % 4.2 % Canadian dollar $ $ $ 32 $ $ 10 $ $ 42 $ 43 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 6.1 % 0.0 % 5.6 % 0.0 % 6.0 % New Zealand dollar $ $ $ $ 34 $ $ $ 34 $ 37 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.5 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.5 % Euro $ $ $ 67 $ $ 22 $ 67 $ 156 $ 162 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 4.8 % 0.0 % 4.8 % 5.1 % 4.9 % Australian dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 38 $ 38 $ 36 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 7.4 % 7.4 % Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ $ $ 94 $ 30 $ 30 $ 186 $ 340 $ 38 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents as of December 31, 2010, of our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps (in millions): Principal/ Notional Estimated Amount Fair Value Currencies British pound $ 66 $ 70 Canadian dollar 43 45 New Zealand dollar 34 35 Euro 162 163 Australian dollar 38 34 Total currencies $ 343 $ 347 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ 340 $ 30 Equity Market Risk Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (RTM) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, deferred sales inducements (DSI) and DFEL. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL for further discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM. Fee Revenues The fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers. Assets While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed 116 income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments.

Estimated fair value does not reflect daily settlement of futures or monthly settlement of total return swaps. Liabilities We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights (SARs) issued in 2007 through 2011. See Notes 6 and 19 for additional information on our SARs and the related call options used to hedge the expected increase in liabilities from SARs granted on our stock. Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Such derivatives include over the counter equity call options, equity collars, variance swaps, total return swaps, put options, equity futures and call options. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity The following presents our estimate of the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions), from the change in asset based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 Index (S&P 500), which ended at 1258 as of December 31, 2011, were to decrease to 1005 over six months after December 31, 2011, and remain at that level through the next six months or increase to 1510 over six months after December 31, 2011, and remain at that level through the next six months, excluding any effect related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change: S&P 500 S&P 500 at 1005 (1) at 1510 (1) Segment Annuities $ (80 ) $ 29 Retirement Plan Services (14 ) 15 117 (1) The baseline for these effects assumes a 4% annual equity market growth rate, depending on the block of business, beginning on January 1, 2012. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 1005 and 1510 levels, which assume the index moves to those levels over six months, remains at those levels through the next six months and grows at 4% annually, depending on the block of business, thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 1005 and 1510 level scenarios is presented in the table. Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL Reversion to the Mean for discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM. The effect on earnings summarized above is a hypothetical scenario for the next 12 months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index. Default Risk Our portfolio of invested assets was $93.1 billion and $83.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Of this total, $61.1 billion and $53.5 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $6.9 billion and $6.8 billion consisted of mortgage loans on real estate as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower quality, higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality. Additional diversification limits, such as limits per industry, are also applied. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing. We depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above. Credit Related Derivatives We use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Credit Risk See Note 6 for information on our credit risk. In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 6, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows: As of December 31, 2011 2010 Rating AAA $ $ 7 AA 23 26 A 56 146 BBB 2 5 Total $ 81 $ 184 118

Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses Rising Rates For both annuities and UL, a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from 1 to 10 years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields. As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse effect of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances. Debt We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise. See Note 13 for additional information on our debt. Derivatives See Note 6 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Foreign Currency Denominated Investments We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar Denominated securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds. See Note 6 for additional information on our foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards used to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. 115 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) as of December 31, 2011, by expected maturity for our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps: Estimated 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value Currencies British pound $ $ $ $ $ $ 66 $ 66 $ 81 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 4.2 % 4.2 % Canadian dollar $ $ $ 32 $ $ 10 $ $ 42 $ 43 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 6.1 % 0.0 % 5.6 % 0.0 % 6.0 % New Zealand dollar $ $ $ $ 34 $ $ $ 34 $ 37 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.5 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.5 % Euro $ $ $ 67 $ $ 22 $ 67 $ 156 $ 162 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 4.8 % 0.0 % 4.8 % 5.1 % 4.9 % Australian dollar $ $ $ $ $ $ 38 $ 38 $ 36 Interest rate 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 7.4 % 7.4 % Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ $ $ 94 $ 30 $ 30 $ 186 $ 340 $ 38 The following provides our principal or notional amount in U.S. dollar equivalents as of December 31, 2010, of our foreign currency denominated investments and foreign currency swaps (in millions): Principal/ Notional Estimated Amount Fair Value Currencies British pound $ 66 $ 70 Canadian dollar 43 45 New Zealand dollar 34 35 Euro 162 163 Australian dollar 38 34 Total currencies $ 343 $ 347 Derivatives Foreign currency swaps $ 340 $ 30 Equity Market Risk Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (RTM) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, deferred sales inducements (DSI) and DFEL. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL for further discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM. Fee Revenues The fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers. Assets While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments, the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed 116 income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments.

Estimated fair value does not reflect daily settlement of futures or monthly settlement of total return swaps. Liabilities We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights (SARs) issued in 2007 through 2011. See Notes 6 and 19 for additional information on our SARs and the related call options used to hedge the expected increase in liabilities from SARs granted on our stock. Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Such derivatives include over the counter equity call options, equity collars, variance swaps, total return swaps, put options, equity futures and call options. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to equity market fluctuations. Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity The following presents our estimate of the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions), from the change in asset based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 Index (S&P 500), which ended at 1258 as of December 31, 2011, were to decrease to 1005 over six months after December 31, 2011, and remain at that level through the next six months or increase to 1510 over six months after December 31, 2011, and remain at that level through the next six months, excluding any effect related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change: S&P 500 S&P 500 at 1005 (1) at 1510 (1) Segment Annuities $ (80 ) $ 29 Retirement Plan Services (14 ) 15 117 (1) The baseline for these effects assumes a 4% annual equity market growth rate, depending on the block of business, beginning on January 1, 2012. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 1005 and 1510 levels, which assume the index moves to those levels over six months, remains at those levels through the next six months and grows at 4% annually, depending on the block of business, thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 1005 and 1510 level scenarios is presented in the table. Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL Reversion to the Mean for discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM. The effect on earnings summarized above is a hypothetical scenario for the next 12 months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index. Default Risk Our portfolio of invested assets was $93.1 billion and $83.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Of this total, $61.1 billion and $53.5 billion consisted of corporate bonds and $6.9 billion and $6.8 billion consisted of mortgage loans on real estate as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower quality, higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality. Additional diversification limits, such as limits per industry, are also applied. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing. We depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above. Credit Related Derivatives We use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Credit Risk See Note 6 for information on our credit risk. In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 6, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows: As of December 31, 2011 2010 Rating AAA $ $ 7 AA 23 26 A 56 146 BBB 2 5 Total $ 81 $ 184 118
