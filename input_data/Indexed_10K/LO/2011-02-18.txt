Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Environment and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in expectations or beliefs or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is or may be based. INTRODUCTORY NOTE For periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K prior to June 10, 2008, Lorillard, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation (Loews), a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE). Our results of operations and financial condition were included as a separate reporting segment in Loewss financial statements and filings with the SEC. Beginning in 2002 and through June 10, 2008, Loews had also issued a separate class of its common stock, referred to as the Carolina Group Stock, to track the economic performance of Loewss 100% interest in Lorillard, Inc. and certain liabilities, costs and expenses of Loews and Lorillard arising out of or related to tobacco or tobacco related businesses. On June 10, 2008, we began operating as an independent, publicly traded company pursuant to our separation from Loews (the Separation). In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation Agreement with Loews to provide for the separation of our business from Loews as well as providing for indemnification and allocation of taxes between the parties. 2 Table of Contents PART I Item 1. BUSINESS Overview Lorillard is the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States. Founded in 1760, Lorillard is the oldest continuously operating tobacco company in the United States. Newport, our flagship menthol flavored premium cigarette brand, is the top selling menthol and second largest selling cigarette brand overall in the United States based on gross units sold in 2010. The Newport brand accounted for approximately 90.0% of our sales revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. In addition to the Newport brand, our product line has four additional brand families marketed under the Kent, True, Maverick, and Old Gold brand names. These five brands include 43 different product offerings which vary in price, taste, flavor, length and packaging. In 2010, we shipped 38.1 billion cigarettes, all of which were sold in the United States and certain U.S. possessions and territories. We sold our major trademarks outside of the United States in 1977. We maintain our headquarters and manufacture all of our products at our Greensboro, North Carolina facility. We produce cigarettes for both the premium and discount segments of the domestic cigarette market. We do not compete in a subcategory of the discount segment that we identify as the deep discount segment. Premium brands are well known, established brands marketed at higher retail prices. Discount brands are generally less well recognized brands marketed at lower retail prices. We define the deep discount subcategory to include brands sold at the lowest retail prices. Deep discount cigarettes are typically manufactured by smaller companies, relative to us and other major U.S. manufacturers, many of which have no, or significantly lower, payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements, consisting of the Master Settlement Agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions (the MSA) and the settlements of similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota. Advertising and Sales Promotion The predominant form of promotion in the industry and for us consists of retail price reduction programs, such as discounting or lowering the price of a pack or carton of cigarettes in the retail store. These programs are developed, implemented and executed by our sales force through merchandising or promotional agreements with retail chain accounts and independent retailers. We focus our retail programs in markets and stores reflecting unique potential for increased menthol sales. Our direct buying wholesale customers provide us with information as to the quantities of cigarettes shipped to their retail accounts on a weekly basis. This data covers approximately 99% of wholesale units shipped by us and our major competitors, and enables us to analyze, plan and execute retail promotion programs in markets and stores that optimize the most efficient and effective return on our promotional investments. We employ other promotion methods to communicate with our adult consumers as well as with adult smokers of our competitors products. These promotional programs include the use of direct marketing communications, retail coupons, relationship marketing and promotional materials intended to be displayed at retail. Relationship marketing entails the use of various communication techniques to directly reach adult consumers in order to establish a relationship with them for the purpose of advertising and promoting a product or products. We use our proprietary database of smokers of our brands and smokers of our competitors brands to reach adult consumers with targeted communications about a given brand through age restricted direct mail and internet programs. We regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, sales promotion costs in any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of costs that may be realized in subsequent periods. Advertising plays a relatively lesser role in our overall marketing strategy. We advertise Newport in a limited number of magazines that meet certain requirements regarding the age and composition of their readership. Newport is our only brand that receives magazine advertising support. 3 Table of Contents Advertising of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since 1971. Under the State Settlement Agreements, the participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion activities including, among other things: prohibiting the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products; banning the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion; limiting each tobacco manufacturer to one brand name event sponsorship during any twelve month period, which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth; banning all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products; banning tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name, subject to specified exceptions; prohibiting the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within adult only facilities; prohibiting payments for tobacco product placement in various media; and banning gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult. On June 22, 2009 the federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the FSPTCA) was signed into law granting authority over the regulation of tobacco products to the FDA. Pursuant to the FSPTCA, the FDA reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in 1995 as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The FSPTCA also contains other restrictions, some of which may be more stringent than those found in the original 1995 FDA rule, affecting the advertising, marketing and sale of cigarette products. See the section entitled Legislation and Regulation below for additional information concerning the marketing and sales provisions of the FSPTCA. In addition, many states, cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising, marketing and sales promotions, and others may do so in the future. We cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on our marketing and sales efforts. We fund a Youth Smoking Prevention Program, which is designed to discourage youth from smoking by promoting parental involvement and assisting parents in discussing the issue of smoking with their children. We are also a founding member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing which through its We Card program trains retailers in how to prevent the purchase of cigarettes by underage persons. In addition, we have adopted guidelines established by the National Association of Attorneys General to restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. Customers and Distribution Our field sales personnel are based throughout the United States, and we maintain field sales offices in major cities throughout the United States. Our sales department is divided into regions based on geography and sales territories. We sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, who in turn service retail outlets, chain store organizations, and government agencies, including the U.S. Armed Forces. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, we ship cigarettes to public distribution warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers. We retain a portion of our manufactured cigarettes at our Greensboro central distribution center and Greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 500 direct buying customers servicing more than 400,000 retail accounts. We do not sell cigarettes directly to consumers. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, sales made by us to the McLane Company, Inc. comprised 27%, 26% and 26%, respectively, of our revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2010, 2009 or 2008 sales. We do not have any written sales agreements with our customers, including the McLane Company, Inc. We do not have any backlog orders. 4 Table of Contents Most of our customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis. Customer orders are shipped from public distribution warehouses via third party carriers. We do not ship products directly to retail stores. In 2010, approximately 98% of our customers purchased cigarettes using electronic funds transfer, which provides immediate payment to us. Raw Materials and Manufacturing In our production of cigarettes, we use domestic and foreign grown burley and flue cured leaf tobaccos, as well as aromatic tobaccos grown primarily in Turkey and other Near Eastern countries. We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf of the type and quality we require at competitive prices from a combination of global sources, and that we are not dependent on any one geographic region or country for our requirements. An affiliate of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) manufactures all of our reconstituted tobacco pursuant to our specifications, as set forth in the agreement between us and RAI. Reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems, and which is used as a component of cigarette blends. We purchase our tobacco leaf through tobacco dealers, which contract with leaf growers. Such purchases are made at prevailing market prices in the country of origin. Due to the varying size and quality of annual crops, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other foreign currencies and other economic factors, tobacco prices have historically fluctuated. We direct these dealers in the purchase of tobacco according to our specifications for quality, grade, yield, particle size, moisture content, and other characteristics. The dealers purchase and process the whole leaf and then dry and package it for shipment to and storage at our Danville, Virginia facility. We have not experienced any difficulty in purchasing our requirement of leaf tobacco. We purchase more than 66% of our domestic leaf tobacco from one dealer, Alliance One International, Inc. (Alliance One). If Alliance One becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us, we believe that we can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established, alternative industry sources. However, we believe that such high quality leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to Alliance One. We store our tobacco in 29 storage warehouses on our 130 acre Danville, Virginia facility. To protect against loss, amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate warehouses. Certain types of tobacco used in our blends must be allowed to mature over time to allow natural chemical changes that enhance certain characteristics affecting taste. Because of these aging requirements, we maintain large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times. We believe our current tobacco inventories are sufficient and adequately balanced for our present and expected production requirements. If necessary, we can typically purchase aged tobacco in the open market to supplement existing inventories. We produce cigarettes at our Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing plant, which has a production capacity of approximately 200 million cigarettes per day and approximately 50 billion cigarettes per year. Through various automated systems and sensors, we actively monitor all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations. Research and Development We have an experienced research and development team that continuously evaluates new products and line extensions and assesses new technologies and scientific advancements to be able to respond to marketplace demands and developing regulatory requirements. Our research and development efforts focus primarily on: developing quality products that appeal to adult consumers; studying and developing consumer acceptable products with the potential for reduced exposure to smoke constituents or reduced health risk; 5 Table of Contents identifying and investigating, through the use of internal and external resources, suspect constituents of cigarette products or their components to determine the feasibility of reduction or elimination; maintaining state of the art knowledge about public health and scientific issues related to cigarette products; developing new, or modifying existing, products and processes to promote quality control and to comply with current and anticipated laws and regulations; and collaborating and cooperating with outside public and private scientific institutions and encouraging independent research relating to cigarette products. Tobacco related research activities include: analysis of cigarette components, including cigarette paper, filters, tobacco and ingredients, including menthol; analysis of mainstream and sidestream smoke; and modification of cigarette design. We employ advanced scientific equipment in our research efforts, including gas chromatographs, mass spectrographs and liquid chromatographs. We use this equipment to structurally identify and measure the amount of chemical compounds found in cigarette smoke and various tobaccos. These measurements allow us to better understand the relationship between the tobacco, cigarette construction, and the smoke yielded from cigarettes. In addition, advanced biological techniques are developed and used to test the biological impact of tobacco smoke on cells and advance our understanding of potential biomarkers for disease risk. Information Technology We are committed to the use of information technology throughout the organization to provide operating effectiveness, cost reduction and competitive advantages. We believe our system platform provides the appropriate level of information in a timely fashion to effectively manage the business. We utilize proven technologies while also continuously exploring new technologies consistent with our information technology architecture strategy. Our information technology environment is anchored by an SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) system designed to meet the processing and analysis needs of our core business operations and financial control requirements. The process control and production methods in our manufacturing operation utilize scanning, radio frequency identification, wireless technologies and software products to monitor and control the manufacturing process. Our primary data center is located at our corporate headquarters and is staffed by an in house team of experienced information technology professionals. A satellite data center, located at our manufacturing facility, supports our manufacturing environment. In addition, we have a comprehensive redundancy and disaster recovery plan in place. Employees As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 2,700 full time employees. As of that date, approximately 1,000 of those employees were represented by labor unions covered by three collective bargaining agreements. Local Union #317T Greensboro of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (AFL CIO CLC) represents workers at our Greensboro manufacturing plant. The agreement covering this Union expires in September 2011. Workers at our Danville, Virginia tobacco storage facility are also represented by Local Union #317T Danville of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (AFL CIO CLC) and Local Union #513 of the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers/SEIU (AFL CIO CLC). The current agreements with Local Union #317T Danville and Local Union #513 will expire in April 2012. We have historically had an amicable relationship with the unions representing our employees. We provide a retirement plan, a profit sharing plan and other benefits for our hourly paid employees who are represented by unions. In addition, we provide to our salaried employees a retirement plan, group life, disability and health insurance program and a savings plan. We also maintain an incentive compensation plan for certain salaried employees. 6 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We believe that our trademarks, including brand names, are important to our business. We own the patents, trade secrets, know how and trademarks, including our brand names and the distinctive packaging and displays, used by us in our business. All of our material trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Rights in these trademarks in the United States will continue indefinitely as long as we continue to use the trademarks. We consider the blends of tobacco and the flavor formulas used to make our brands to be trade secrets. These trade secrets are generally not the subject of patents, though various of our manufacturing processes are patented. We sold the international rights to substantially all of our major brands, including Newport, in 1977. Competition The domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is primarily based on a brands taste; quality; price, including the level of discounting and other promotional activities; positioning; consumer loyalty; and retail display. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris USA Inc. (Philip Morris), a subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR Tobacco), a subsidiary of RAI. We also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes. We believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands. As a result, in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs, which may constrain sales. Please read the sections entitled Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Environment and Selected Industry and Market Share Data beginning on pages 28 and 30, respectively, for additional information. Legislation and Regulation Our business operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the research, development and manufacture of cigarettes; the development of new tobacco products; the publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging and advertising; the sale of tobacco products; restrictions on smoking in public places; and fire safety standards. From time to time, new legislation and regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulation of tobacco products. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals, reports and recommendations. If they are enacted or implemented, certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition or results of operations in the future. Federal Regulation The Federal Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, which became effective in 1985, requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements, on a rotating basis: (1) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, and may Complicate Pregnancy. (2) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health. (3) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight. (4) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. 7 Table of Contents This law also requires that each company that manufactures, packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes. This list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients. In addition, bills have been introduced in Congress, including those that would: prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion; authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs; provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law; permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes; direct the placement of advertising of tobacco products; provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense; prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores, by mail or over the internet; impose additional, or increase existing, excise taxes on cigarettes and require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them, under certain circumstances, to be self extinguishing. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act that grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation: established a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to, among other things, evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA regarding menthol by March 23, 2011; grants the FDA the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process, including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes; requires larger and more severe health warnings, including graphic images, on packs, cartons, and advertising; bans the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and light; requires the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers; requires pre market approval by the FDA of all new products, including substantially equivalent products; requires pre market approval by the FDA for all claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; allows the FDA to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market; allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes; allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes; allows the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales of cigarettes; and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation. 8 Table of Contents The legislation permits the FDA to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes, including a ban, if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health. Any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. It is possible that such additional regulation, including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof, could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States (including sales of our brands), increased costs to us, and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Environmental Tobacco Smoke Various publications and studies by governmental entities have reported that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) presents health risks. In addition, public health organizations have issued statements on the adverse health effects of ETS, and scientific papers have been published that address the health problems associated with ETS exposure. Various states, cities and municipalities have restricted public smoking in recent years, and these restrictions have been based at least in part on the publications regarding the health risks believed to be associated with ETS exposure. The governmental entities that have published these reports have included the Surgeon General of the United States, first in 1986 and again in 2006. The 2006 report, for instance, concluded that there is no risk free level of exposure to ETS. In 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services listed ETS as a known human carcinogen. In 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded that ETS is a human lung carcinogen in adults and causes respiratory effects in children. Agencies of state governments also have issued publications regarding ETS, including reports by California entities that were published in 1997, 1999 and 2006. In the 2006 study, the California Air Resources Board determined that ETS is a toxic air contaminant. Based on these or other findings, public health concerns regarding ETS have lead and could continue to lead to the imposition of additional restrictions on public smoking, including bans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future. State and Local Regulation Many state, local and municipal governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking, including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace. This trend has increased significantly since the release of the EPAs report regarding ETS in 1993. Two states, Massachusetts and Texas, have enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents, and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands. Neither law allows for the public release of trade secret information. A New York law which became effective in June 2004 requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard for ignition propensity. We developed proprietary technology to comply with the standards and were compliant by the effective date. Since the passage of the New York law, an additional 48 states and the District of Columbia have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards. The effective dates of these laws range from May 2006 to January 2011. As of November 1, 2009, all of our cigarettes were manufactured using this technology. Other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments. We cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on our business, though if enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future. 9 Table of Contents Excise Taxes and Assessments Cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes in the United States and, in general, such taxes have been increasing. Effective April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes (or $1.0066 per pack of 20 cigarettes) from $19.50 per thousand cigarettes (or $0.39 per pack of 20 cigarettes). State excise taxes, which are levied upon and paid by the distributors, are also in effect in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and many municipalities. Increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in six states during 2010 and ranged from $0.40 per pack to $1.60 per pack. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the combined state and municipal taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack of cigarettes. A federal law enacted in October 2004 repealed the federal supply management program for tobacco growers and compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with payments to be funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers. Cigarette manufacturers and importers are responsible for paying 95.5% of a $10.14 billion payment to tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten year period. The law provides that payments will be based on shipments for domestic consumption. Separation Agreement with Loews Corporation In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation Agreement with Loews Corporation on May 7, 2008. The Separation Agreement sets forth the relationship between Lorillard and Loews following the Separation, including provisions relating to indemnification and tax allocation between the parties. Indemnification Provisions We agreed to indemnify Loews and its officers, directors, employees and agents against all costs and expenses arising out of third party claims (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, interest, penalties and costs of investigation or preparation for defense), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, taxes, demands, assessments and amounts paid in settlement based on, arising out of or resulting from: the ownership or the operation of our assets and properties, and the operation or conduct of our businesses at any time prior to or following the Separation (including with respect to any smoking and health claims and litigation); certain tax matters, as discussed below; any other activities in which we may engage; any action or omission by us (or any successor entity) that causes the Separation to become taxable to Loews; any breach by us of the Separation Agreement; any other acts or omissions by us arising out of the performance of our obligations under the Separation Agreement; misstatements in or omissions from the registration statement filed with regard to the Separation, other than misstatements or omissions made in reliance on information relating to and furnished by Loews for use in the preparation of such registration statement; and any taxes and related losses resulting from the receipt of any such indemnity payment. Our indemnification obligations, including the tax indemnification obligations described below, are binding on our successors. We are not permitted to merge, consolidate, transfer or convey all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity, transferee or successor expressly agrees in writing to be bound by these indemnification obligations. Any equity security or equity interest of Lorillard Licensing Company, LLC (Lorillard Licensing), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary and owner of our trademarks, or any interest in the intellectual property owned by Lorillard Licensing, is deemed a significant portion for purposes of the foregoing. 10 Table of Contents We also agreed to release Loews and its shareholders, officers, directors and employees from any liability owed by any of them to us with respect to acts or events occurring on or prior to the Separation date, except with respect to tax matters. The Separation Agreement also provides that Loews will indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees and agents against losses, including but not limited to, litigation matters, and other claims, based on, arising out of or resulting from: any activity that Loews and its subsidiaries (other than us) engage in; any breach by Loews of the Separation Agreement; any other acts or omissions by Loews arising out of the performance of its obligations under the Separation Agreement; and misstatements in or omissions from the registration statement filed with regard to the Separation, but only with respect to misstatements or omissions made in reliance on information relating to and furnished by Loews for use in the preparation of such registration statement. Loews agreed to release us and all of our directors, officers and employees from any liability owed by any of us to Loews with respect to acts or events occurring on or prior to the Separation date, except with respect to tax matters. Tax Allocation Provisions Following the Separation, we are no longer included in Loewss consolidated group for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the Separation, the Separation Agreement provides certain tax allocation arrangements, pursuant to which we will indemnify Loews for tax liabilities that are allocated to us for taxable periods ending on or before the Separation date. The amount of federal income taxes allocated to us for such periods is generally equal to the federal income taxes that would have been payable by us during such periods if we had filed separate consolidated returns. In addition, with respect to periods in which we were included in Loewss consolidated group, Loews will indemnify us with respect to the tax liability of the members of the Loews consolidated group other than us. After the Separation, we have the right to be notified of and participate in tax matters for which we are financially responsible under the terms of the Separation Agreement, although Loews will generally control such matters. The Separation Agreement requires us (and any successor entity) to indemnify Loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the Separation to qualify as a tax free transaction (except if the failure to qualify is solely due to Loewss fault). This indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above, or whether we or a potential successor obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel. The Separation Agreement further provides for cooperation between us and Loews with respect to additional tax matters, including the exchange of information and the retention of records which may affect the income tax liability of the parties to the Separation Agreement.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS FDA regulation of menthol in cigarettes and concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect our business. Some plaintiffs in our litigation and constituencies, including the FDA and other public health agencies, have claimed or expressed concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than non mentholated cigarettes, including concerns that mentholated cigarettes may make it easier to start smoking and harder to quit and may seek restrictions or a ban on the production and sale of mentholated cigarettes. Any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Following the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in June 2009, the FDA established the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (the TPSAC) to evaluate, among other things, the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health, including such use among children, African Americans, Hispanics, and other racial and ethnic minorities. In addition, the FSPTCA permits the FDA to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes, including a ban, if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health. The TPSAC held meetings on March 30 31, 2010, July 15 16, 2010, September 27, 2010, October 7, 2010, November 18, 2010 and January 10 11, 2011 to consider the issues surrounding the use of menthol in cigarettes. TPSAC has scheduled further meetings on the use of menthol in cigarettes, and TPSACs report and nonbinding recommendations on menthol are currently due to the FDA by March 23, 2011. Since we are the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the United States, we could face increased exposure to tobacco related litigation as a result of such allegations. Even if such claims are unsubstantiated, increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could materially adversely affect our sales, including sales of Newport. A ban or limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes by the FDA would materially adversely affect our business. The regulation of cigarettes by the Food and Drug Administration may materially adversely affect our business. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act that grants the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation: established a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to, among other things, evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA regarding menthol by March 23, 2011; grants the FDA the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process, including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes; requires larger and more severe health warnings, including graphic images, on packs, cartons and advertising; bans the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and light; requires the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers; requires pre market approval by the FDA of all new products, including substantially equivalent products; 12 Table of Contents requires pre market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; allows the FDA to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market; allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes; allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes; allows the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales of cigarettes; and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminates the existing federal preemption of such regulation. We believe that such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, under the FSPTCA, we must file a report with the FDA substantiating that any cigarettes introduced or modified after February 15, 2007 are substantially equivalent to cigarettes on the market before that date to enable the agency to determine whether the new or modified products are substantially equivalent to specific predicate products already being sold. For any products introduced or modified between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011, initial reports must be filed with the FDA before March 23, 2011. The FDA has announced that a product introduced or modified before March 22, 2011 may remain on the market pending the FDAs review, provided a substantially equivalent report has been filed with the FDA on or before March 22, 2011. We believe, based on the limited guidance issued by the FDA to date, that we must file reports for all of our cigarettes by March 23, 2011 since modifications have been made to our products since 2007. While all of our cigarettes may remain on the market pending the FDAs review, they are subject to removal should the FDA determine any are not substantially equivalent. The legislation also permits the FDA to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes, including a ban, if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health. Any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. It is possible that such additional regulation, including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof, could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States (including sales of our brands), increased costs to us and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As of February 9, 2011, Lorillard Tobacco is a defendant in approximately 9,758 tobacco related lawsuits, including approximately 701 cases in which Lorillard, Inc. is a co defendant. These cases, which are extremely costly to defend, could result in substantial judgments against Lorillard Tobacco and or Lorillard, Inc. Numerous legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc., and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future. In addition, several cases have been filed against Lorillard Tobacco and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of the MSA among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions, and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the MSA. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that the outcome of these cases, individually or in the aggregate, could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc. may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case. Even if Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc. are successful in defending some or all of these actions, these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, adverse decisions in litigations against other tobacco companies could have an adverse impact on the industry, including us. 13 Table of Contents A jury has returned verdicts that award damages from Lorillard Tobacco in a Conventional Product Liability Case. In December 2010, a Massachusetts jury awarded $50 million in compensatory damages to the estate of a deceased smoker, $21 million in damages to the deceased smokers son, and $81 million in punitive damages from Lorillard Tobacco in a Conventional Product Liability Case, Evans v. Lorillard Tobacco Company (Superior Court, Suffolk County, Massachusetts). As of February 9, 2011, the case remained pending before the trial court because the judge has not issued a verdict as to a single claim that was not submitted for the jurys consideration. It is possible the court will award additional damages to the plaintiffs in its verdict that addresses this final claim. As of February 9, 2011, the court had not ruled on the motions filed by Lorillard Tobacco following the verdicts, which includes motions for new trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for reduction or elimination of the jurys damages awards. The court is not expected to issue a final judgment until it disposes of the final claim or it rules on Lorillard Tobaccos post trial motions. Lorillard Tobacco may file additional post trial motions after a final judgment is entered. Should the final judgment award damages to the plaintiff, Massachusetts statutes provide that the court may award prejudgment and post judgment interest. The opportunity for Lorillard Tobacco to initiate an appeal from the verdicts in Evans will not begin until the final judgment is entered. Plaintiff has asked the court to enter a preliminary injunction that directs Lorillard Tobacco to set aside $272 million in cash or cash equivalents to secure the amounts awarded by the jury and the interest obligations plaintiff expects the court to order in a final judgment. As of February 9, 2011, the court had not ruled on plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction. It is possible that the verdict in this case could lead to additional litigation. A judgment has been rendered against Lorillard Tobacco in the Scott litigation. In July 2008, the District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, entered an amended final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al. (District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996), a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana. In April 2010, the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, issued a decision that modified the trial courts 2008 amended final judgment. The Court of Appeals decision reduced the judgment amount to approximately $242 million to fund a ten year court supervised smoking cessation program. The April 2010 decision ordered that an award of post judgment interest will accrue from July 2008. Interest awarded by the amended final judgment will continue to accrue from July 2008 until the judgment either is paid or is reversed on appeal. As of February 9, 2011, judicial interest totaled approximately $32.1 million. Lorillard Tobaccos share of any judgment, including an award of post judgment interest, has not been determined. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a pretax provision of approximately $66 million for this matter. Lorillard, Inc., which was a party to the case in the past, is no longer a defendant. The U.S. Supreme Court has granted defendants application to stay execution of the amended final judgment until defendants petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court is resolved. As of February 9, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court had not determined whether it will grant review of defendants certiorari petition. It is not possible to predict the final outcome of this matter. The Florida Supreme Courts ruling in Engle has resulted in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including us. The case of Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. (Circuit Court, Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994) was certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to smoking. The case was tried between 1998 and 2000 in a multi phase trial that resulted in verdicts in favor of the class. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that, among other things, determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action. In February 2008, the trial court entered an order on remand from the Florida Supreme Court that formally decertified the class. The 2006 ruling by the Florida Supreme Court in Engle also permitted members of the Engle class to file individual claims, including claims for punitive damages. The Florida Supreme Court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely on a number of the jurys findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase of 14 Table of Contents the Engle trial. These findings included that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases; that cigarettes are addictive or dependence producing; and that the defendants, including Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc., were negligent, breached express and implied warranties, placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking. Lorillard Tobacco is a defendant in approximately 7,100 cases pending in various state and federal courts in Florida that were filed by members of the Engle class (the Engle Progeny Cases), including 695 cases in which Lorillard, Inc. is a co defendant. As of February 9, 2011, Lorillard Tobacco was a defendant in one Engle Progeny Case in which trial was underway. Lorillard, Inc. is not a defendant in this trial. Neither Lorillard Tobacco nor Lorillard, Inc. were defendants in three additional Engle Progeny Cases in which trial was underway as of February 9, 2011. In addition, Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc. are defendants in Engle Progeny Cases that have been placed on courts 2011 trial calendars or in which specific trial dates have been set. Trial schedules are subject to change and it is not possible to predict how many of the Engle Progeny Cases pending against Lorillard Tobacco or Lorillard, Inc. will be tried during 2011. It also is not possible to predict whether some courts will implement procedures that consolidate multiple Engle Progeny Cases for trial. As of February 9, 2011, verdicts have been returned in 32 Engle Progeny Cases since the Florida Supreme Court issued its 2006 ruling. Lorillard Tobacco was a defendant in one of the 32 trials. As of February 9, 2011, Lorillard, Inc. had not been a defendant in any of the trials in which verdicts were returned. Juries awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages in 14 of these trials. The punitive damages awards have totaled $527 million and have ranged from $270,000 to $244 million. In six of the trials, juries awarded only compensatory damages. In the twelve other trials, juries found in favor of the defendants. In the single trial in which Lorillard Tobacco had been a defendant as of February 9, 2011, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. In some of the trials decided in the defendants favor, plaintiffs have filed motions challenging the verdicts. It is not possible to predict the final outcome of this litigation. The judgment entered in the federal governments reimbursement case, while not final in all respects, could restrict or limit our defenses in other litigation. In August 2006, a final judgment and remedial order was entered in United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. (U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). The court based its final judgment and remedial order on the governments only remaining claims, which were based on the defendants alleged violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Lorillard, Inc. is not a party to this matter, but Lorillard Tobacco is one of the defendants in the case. Although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial order imposed a number of requirements on the defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. In 2009, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals upheld substantially all of the District Courts final judgment and remedial order. In June 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties petitions seeking review of the case. The case has been returned to the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia for implementation of the Court of Appeals directions in its 2009 ruling and for entry of an amended final judgment. As of February 9, 2011, the trial court had not entered the amended final judgment. The 2006 final judgment and remedial order made many adverse findings regarding the conduct of the defendants. It is possible that the final opinion, final judgment and remedial order entered by the court could form the basis of allegations by the plaintiffs in other matters, or of additional judicial findings by other courts against cigarette manufacturers. It is possible that other courts could apply the findings in the United States of America case to restrict or otherwise limit our defenses in other litigation. 15 Table of Contents A ruling by the United States Supreme Court could limit the ability of cigarette manufacturers to contend that certain claims asserted against them in product liability litigation are barred. The Supreme Courts decision also could encourage litigation involving cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar. In December 2008, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision that neither the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act nor the Federal Trade Commissions regulation of cigarettes tar and nicotine disclosures preempts (or bars) some of plaintiffs claims. The decision also more broadly addresses the scope of preemption based on the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, and could significantly limit cigarette manufacturers arguments that certain of plaintiffs other claims in smoking and health litigation, including claims based on the alleged concealment of information with respect to the hazards of smoking, are preempted. In addition, the Supreme Courts ruling could encourage litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including us, regarding the sale of cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar, and it may limit cigarette manufacturers ability to defend such claims. The Supreme Court issued this ruling in a purported lights class action, Good v. Altria Group, Inc. We were not a defendant in Good. The U.S. Surgeon General has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes, and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. In a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General summarized conclusions from previous Surgeon Generals reports concerning the health effects of exposure to second hand smoke by non smokers. According to this report, scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions: Second hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke. Children exposed to second hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections and ear problems. Exposure of adults to second hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer. The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk free level of exposure to second hand smoke. Many millions of Americans, both children and adults, are exposed to second hand smoke in their homes and workplaces. Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non smokers from exposure to second hand smoke. Separating smokers from non smokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non smokers to second hand smoke. This report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including us. The report could be used to support existing litigation against us or other cigarette manufacturers. It also is possible that the Surgeon Generals report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. It is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of our brands. These developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We have substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and operating income in future periods. In 1998, Lorillard Tobacco, Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the Original Participating Manufacturers) entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (the Initial State Settlements and, together with the MSA, are referred to as the State Settlement Agreements). 16 Table of Contents Under the State Settlement Agreements, we paid $1.134 billion in 2010 and are obligated to pay between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2011, primarily based on 2010 estimated industry volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on our domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments, with respect to the MSA, in the year preceding the year in which payment is due, and, with respect to the Initial State Settlements, in the year in which payment is due. We are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of certain material pending litigation. We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements and the provision relating to the Scott case, as described in the risk factor A judgment has been rendered against Lorillard Tobacco in the Scott litigation above, we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation. We face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors introduction of low priced products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco. We also compete against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes. If our major competitors were to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers, we could respond by increasing price discounts, which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We are subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm our competitive position. Television and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since 1971. Under the State Settlement Agreements, we generally cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of concerts, non tobacco merchandise bearing Lorillards brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. In addition, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products. Accordingly, we have determined not to advertise our cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. On June 22, 2009 the federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law granting authority over the regulation of tobacco products to the FDA. Pursuant to the FSPTCA, the FDA reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in 1995 as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The FSPTCA contains other restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sale of cigarette products more stringent than those found in the original FDA rule. In addition, many states, cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising, marketing and sales promotions, and others may do so in the future. Additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including us, to launch new premium brands. 17 Table of Contents Changes in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition to the regulation of our business by the FDA, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by new or future legal requirements imposed by legislative or regulatory initiatives, including but not limited to those relating to health care reform, climate change and environmental matters. For example, the health care reform legislation, which was signed into law in March 2010, resulted in the repeal of $2 million of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for our retiree drug benefits and could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits, employer sponsored medical plans and related matters in future periods. However, the extent of that impact, if any, cannot be determined until regulations are promulgated and additional interpretations of the health care law are available. New legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase the prices of goods and services because of increased costs or reduced availability. We cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory initiatives will result in significant changes to existing laws and regulations and or whether any changes in such laws or regulations will have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes. On April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased $0.6166 per pack to $1.0066 per pack to finance health insurance for children. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack. Various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes substantially in recent years. In addition, increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in six states during 2010 and ranged from $0.40 per pack to $1.60 per pack. It is our expectation that several states will propose further increases in 2011 and in subsequent years. We believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes. In addition, we believe that the 2009 increase in the federal excise tax, as well as possible future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, compounded by poor economic conditions, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including us, and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. We are dependent on the domestic cigarette business, which we expect to continue to contract. Although we conduct business in Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, our cigarette business in the 50 states of the United States (the domestic cigarette market) is currently our only significant business. The domestic cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue to contract. We do not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects, as we sold the international rights to substantially all of our brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors, industry wide domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately 3.5% during the period 2000 through 2010. Industry wide domestic cigarette shipments decreased by an estimated 3.8% for 2010 compared to 2009, 8.6% for 2009 compared to 2008, 3.3% for 2008 to 2007 and 5.0% during 2007, compared to 2006. We derive most of our revenue from one brand. Our largest selling brand, Newport, accounted for approximately 90.0% of our sales revenue for 2010. Our principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales promotion in support of the Newport brand. We cannot ensure that we will continue to successfully implement our strategic plan with respect to Newport or that implementation of our strategic plan will result in the maintenance or growth of the Newport brand. 18 Table of Contents The use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on our business. Since 1998, the cigarette market has been increasingly price competitive due to the impact of, among other things, higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands. In response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures, we have engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives. The cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on our business. We regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods. We rely on a limited number of key executives and may continue to experience difficulty in attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business. The loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business. As a tobacco company, we may experience difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified executives and other personnel in some areas of our business. This difficulty is primarily attributable to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. The loss of services of any key personnel or our inability to attract and hire personnel with requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products, enhance existing products in a timely manner, sell products or manage our business effectively. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences. Consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require us to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products. For example, 49 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products. We believe that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette, an alternative cigarette or an alternative tobacco product that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects. Certain of the other major cigarette makers have already developed and marketed alternative cigarette products. We may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers. In addition, the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial. Increased restrictions on smoking in public places could adversely affect our sales volume, revenue and profitability. In recent years, states and many local and municipal governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict, or discourage smoking; smoking in public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars; and smoking on airline flights and in the workplace. Other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by state and local governments in the future. Although we have no empirical evidence of the effect of such restrictions, we believe that restrictions on smoking in public and other places may lead to a decrease in the number of people who smoke or a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers. Increased restrictions on smoking in public and other places may have caused a decrease, and may continue to cause a decrease in the volume of cigarettes that would otherwise be sold by us absent such restrictions, which may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits. The availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect our sales volume, revenue and profitability. Sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the United States, including counterfeits of our Newport brand, could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands. Additionally, smokers who mistake counterfeit cigarettes for our 19 Table of Contents cigarettes may attribute quality and taste deficiencies in the counterfeit product to our brands and discontinue purchasing our brands. Although we do not believe that sales of counterfeit Newport cigarettes have had a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits to date, the availability of counterfeit Newport cigarettes together with substantial increases in excise taxes and other potential price increases could result in increased demand for counterfeit product that could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits in the future. We rely on a single manufacturing facility for the production of our cigarettes. We produce all of our cigarettes at our Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing facility. If our manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or incapacitated or we are otherwise unable to operate our manufacturing facility, we may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits. We rely on a small number of suppliers for certain of our domestic leaf tobacco and reconstituted tobacco. We purchase approximately 66% of our domestic leaf tobacco through one supplier, Alliance One International, Inc. If Alliance One becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us, we believe that leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to Alliance One, which could have a material adverse effect on our future profits. In addition, we purchase all of our reconstituted tobacco from one supplier, which is an affiliate of RAI, one of our major competitors. Reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems, and which is used as a component of cigarette blends. If RAI becomes unwilling or unable to supply us and we are unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis, our operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits in the future. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business. Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. Our ability to maintain and further build brand recognition is dependent on the continued and exclusive use of our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logo and the unique features of our tobacco products. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are ineffective, thereby permitting a third party to misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from growing or maintaining market share. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our Common Stock. Our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include: a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms; elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent; rules regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors. 20 Table of Contents Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding Common Stock. We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our board with time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to prevent such takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests and those of our shareholders. The Separation Agreement between us and Loews contains provisions that may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us. The tax free nature of the Separation may be affected by certain transactions undertaken by us. In particular, under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Separation would become taxable to Loews if it was determined that 50% or more of the shares of our Common Stock were acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the Separation. If, as a result of acquisitions of our Common Stock subsequent to the Separation, the Separation becomes taxable pursuant to Section 355(e), Loews would recognize a substantial gain for tax purposes as the Separation would be treated as a sale of Lorillard for federal income tax purposes. The Separation Agreement requires us (and any successor entity) to indemnify Loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the Separation to qualify as a tax free transaction (except if the failure to qualify is solely due to Loewss fault). This indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above, or whether we or a potential acquirer obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel. These restrictions and potential indemnification obligations may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us. We are required to indemnify Loews against losses and other expenses incurred at any time (including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation) with respect to our assets, properties and businesses. In the Separation Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Loews and its officers, directors, employees and agents against costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, litigation matters and other claims) based on, arising out of or resulting from, among other things, the ownership or the operation of us and our assets and properties, and the operation or conduct of us and our businesses at any time prior to or following the Separation (including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation). If Loews incurs legal or other fees or costs and expenses resulting from the operation of our businesses or otherwise with respect to us, we are required to reimburse Loews for such losses and any legal or other fees related thereto, which could be substantial. These indemnification obligations may discourage third parties from trying to acquire us because our indemnification obligations are binding on our successors and we are prohibited by the Separation Agreement from merging, consolidating or transferring all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity, transferee or successor agrees to be bound by these indemnification obligations. In addition, we could face substantial charges for indemnification payments to Loews, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We do not believe the Separation has altered or will alter our legal exposure with respect to tobacco related claims. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item 2. PROPERTIES Our manufacturing facility is located on approximately 80 acres in Greensboro, North Carolina. This 854,300 square foot plant contains modern high speed cigarette manufacturing machinery. The Greensboro facility also includes a warehouse with shipping and receiving areas totaling 187,300 square feet. In addition, 21 Table of Contents we own tobacco receiving and storage facilities totaling approximately 1,400,000 square feet in Danville, Virginia. Our executive offices are located in a 130,000 square foot, four story office building in Greensboro. Our 93,800 square foot research facility is also located in Greensboro. Our principal properties are owned in fee and generally we own all of the machinery we use. We believe that our properties and machinery are in generally good condition. We lease sales offices in major cities throughout the United States, a cold storage facility in Greensboro and warehousing space in 19 public distribution warehouses located throughout the United States.

Our Common Stock began trading regular way on the NYSE under the symbol LO on June 10, 2008. There were 68 shareholders of record as of February 11, 2011. This figure excludes any estimate of the indeterminate number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies. The following table presents the high and low sales prices of our Common Stock on the NYSE as well as cash dividends declared per share during the fiscal quarters indicated: Cash Dividends Price per Share Declared Common Stock Market Price High Low per Share 2010 Fourth Quarter $ 89.71 $ 78.54 $ 1.125 Third Quarter 83.03 70.87 1.125 Second Quarter 82.26 70.24 1.00 First Quarter 81.74 72.07 1.00 2009 Fourth Quarter $ 81.76 $ 73.61 $ 1.00 Third Quarter 78.57 66.46 1.00 Second Quarter 69.94 58.73 0.92 First Quarter 67.00 52.51 0.92 Dividend Policy Lorillards current policy is to return approximately 70 75% of its earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends over the long term. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our Common Stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a holding company with no material liquid assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the receipt of dividends from our operating subsidiaries. In 2010, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $152 million, $171 million and $167 million on March 11, 2010, June 11, 2010, September 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, respectively. In 2009, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $155 million, $163 million and $158 million on March 12, 2009, June 12, 2009, September 11, 2009 and December 11, 2009, respectively. In 2008, we paid cash dividends to Loews of $291 million and $200 million on January 24, 2008 and April 28, 2008, respectively, prior to the Separation. Following the Separation, we paid cash dividends of $158 million and $155 million to shareholders on September 12, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. 23 Table of Contents Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our Common Stock from June 10, 2008, the date our Common Stock commenced trading on a when issued basis, to December 31, 2010 with the comparable cumulative return of (i) the SP 500 Index and (ii) the SP Tobacco Index.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes related to those financial statements and Item 6. Selected Financial Data appearing herein. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the Forward Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Business Environment and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include: (1) accruals for tobacco settlement costs, legal expenses and litigation costs, sales incentive programs, income taxes and share based compensation, (2) the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and (3) the valuation of pension assets. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Tobacco Settlement Costs In 1998, we and the other Original Participating Manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (which are referred to as the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, are referred to as the State Settlement Agreements). Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments, with respect to the MSA, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due, and, with respect to the Initial State Settlements, in the year in which payment is due. We record our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped. Please read State Settlement Agreements beginning on page 36 for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Tobacco and Other Litigation We and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages, return of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages. We believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us. We also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us. While we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. We may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements and the provision relating to the Scott case, as described in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76, our management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation. Defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling, general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred. Defense costs may increase in future periods, in part, as a result of the Engle Progeny Cases as described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period. The principal factors are as follows: the number and types of cases filed and appealed; the number of cases tried and appealed; the development of the law; the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel; and litigation strategy and tactics. Please read Note 19 Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76 for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations We are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense. In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The discount rate was determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation, discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date, and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation. 27 Table of Contents The salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook. Long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, asset allocations and managements expectation of the future economic environment. Our major assumptions are set forth in Note 13 to our Consolidated Audited Financial Statements beginning on page 56. For 2010, hypothetical changes in the assumptions we used for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense: A decrease of 25 basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; and An increase of 25 basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately $1 million. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740 prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis, or market. The inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although, due to the duration of the aging processes, a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Recently adopted accounting pronouncements in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 47. Business Environment Participants in the U.S. tobacco industry, including us, face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so, including: A substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars, as well as equitable and injunctive relief, arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes, addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights, as well as other alleged damages. Substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity, and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of certain settlement agreements, including the Master Settlement Agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions (the MSA) that we entered into in 1998 along with Philip 28 Table of Contents Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the other Original Participating Manufacturers) to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, the State Settlement Agreements). The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes. The domestic cigarette market, in which we currently conduct our only significant business, continues to contract. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising, promotions and smoking in public and private facilities, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors, domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately 3.5% from 2000 through 2010. Increases in cigarette prices since 1998 have led to an increase in the volume of discount and, specifically, deep discount cigarettes. Cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in federal, state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases. Price increases have led, and continue to lead, to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands. Deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share in 1998 of less than 2.0% to an estimated 14.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic market. We do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking, but it is likely that increased prices may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so. The tobacco industry is subject to substantial and increasing regulation. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granting the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. Pursuant to the terms of the FSPTCA, the FDA could promulgate regulations that could, among other things, result in a ban on or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes. The law imposes and will impose new restrictions on the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, require larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging, permit restriction of the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured. In August 2009, we, along with RJR Tobacco, other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the FDA challenging the constitutionality of certain restrictions on speech included in the FSPTCA. These restrictions on speech include, among others, bans on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising, limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products, a prohibition on making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products, restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising, a ban on certain promotions offering gifts in consideration for the purchase of tobacco products, a ban on brand name sponsorship of events and the sale of brand name merchandise, and a ban on the distribution of product samples. The suit also challenges the laws requirement for extensive graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising. The complaint seeks a judgment (i) declaring that such provisions of the law violate the First and or Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and (ii) enjoining the FDA from enforcing the unconstitutional provisions of the law. On January 4, 2010, the district court issued an order (a) striking down the provisions of the law that banned the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising and prohibited tobacco manufacturers from making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products and (b) upholding the remaining challenged advertising provisions. Both sides have appealed the district courts ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the appeal has been fully briefed. While we believe there is established legal precedent supporting our claims we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeal. Nor can we make any assurances that any such appeal will be successful. 29 Table of Contents The federal government and many state and local governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict or discourage smoking, including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars, on airline flights and in the workplace. Other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by federal, state and local governments in the future. Substantial federal, state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes. As of April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax was $1.0066 per pack and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, excise tax increases ranging from $0.40 to $1.60 per pack were implemented in six states and the District of Columbia. Congress enacted and the President signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes by $0.6166 per pack to $1.0066 per pack, effective April 1, 2009, to finance health insurance for children. It is likely that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the most recent increase and future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including us, and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. In addition, we and other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers. The domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is primarily based on a brands taste; quality; price, including the level of discounting and other promotional activities; positioning; consumer loyalty; and retail display. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco. We also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes, including deep discount cigarette manufacturers. We believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands. As a result, in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs, which may constrain sales.

(MSAI), an independent third party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers. MSAI divides the 30 Table of Contents cigarette market into two price segments, the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment. MSAIs information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates derived by MSAI. Management believes that volume and market share information for deep discount manufacturers may be understated and, correspondingly, market share information for the larger manufacturers, including Lorillard, may be overstated by MSAI. Lorillard has made certain adjustments to the data received from MSAI to reflect managements judgment as to which brands are included in the menthol segment. (2) Source: Lorillard shipment reports.

Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume increased 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Total Newport unit volume increased 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 31.5% in 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding the launch of Newport Non Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010, Newports domestic wholesale unit shipments increased 1.2% during the current year. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 3.8% during 2010 compared to 2009. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.2% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2010 compared to 70.5% during 2009. Our total domestic wholesale market share, based on wholesale shipments, increased by 1.0 share point during 2010 to 12.3% from 11.3% in 2009. Total Newport domestic wholesale market share increased by 0.7 share points during 2010 to 10.5% from 9.8% in 2009. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $482 million, or 14.5%, from $3.327 billion in 2009 to $3.809 billion in 2010. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($287 million), higher unit sales volume ($67 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($7 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($84 million), higher Food and Drug Administration fees ($26 million) and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers ($11 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.212 billion and $1.128 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of $84 million. The $84 million increase is due to the impact of higher unit sales ($54), the impact of the inflation adjustment ($32 million), partially offset by other adjustments ($2 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 9.0%, from $365 million in 2009 to $398 million in 2010 as a result of higher legal and compensation costs incurred in the current year. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $67 million in 2010, compared to 2009, and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2010. Income taxes. Income taxes increased $35 million or 6.1%, from $571 million in 2009 to $606 million in 2010. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $116 million in 2010 or 7.6%, offset partially by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 37.6% to 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The decrease was driven by a statutory increase in the manufacturers deduction, offset partially by the unfavorable impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted during the first quarter of 2010. 32 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,547 and $712) $ 5,233 $ 4,204 Cost of sales 3,327 2,434 Gross profit 1,906 1,770 Selling, general and administrative 365 355 Operating income 1,541 1,415 Investment income 5 20 Interest expense (27 ) (1 ) Income before income taxes 1,519 1,434 Income taxes 571 547 Net income $ 948 $ 887 Net sales. Net sales increased by $1.029 billion, or 24.5%, from $4.204 billion in 2008 to $5.233 billion in 2009. Net sales increased $835 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009 and $533 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in May and December 2008 and February and March 2009, partially offset by $251 million due to lower unit sales volume and $88 million of higher sales incentives. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume decreased 3.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Our domestic wholesale shipments in 2009 reflect the negative impact of the federal excise tax increase implemented on April 1, 2009. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Newport unit volume decreased 6.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 8.6% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.5% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2009 compared to 72.7% during 2008. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $893 million, or 36.7%, from $2.434 billion in 2008 to $3.327 billion in 2009. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($835 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($74 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($11 million), the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees ($9 million) and higher pension expense ($15 million), partially offset by lower unit sales volume ($34 million) and the absence of free product promotions ($17 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.128 billion and $1.117 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of $11 million. The $11 million increase is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment ($30 million) and other adjustments ($24 million), partially offset by lower unit sales ($43 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10 million, or 2.8%, from $355 million in 2008 to $365 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses of $18 million due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle Progeny Cases and higher pension expense of $8 million, partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs of $6 million and the absence of an $18 million charge in 2008 related to the Separation. Investment income. Investment income decreased $15 million in 2009, compared to 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $26 million in 2009, compared to 2008, and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements. 33 Table of Contents Income taxes. Income taxes increased $24 million or 4.4% from $547 million in 2008 to $571 million in 2009. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $85 million in 2009 or 5.9% partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 38.2% in 2008 to 37.6% in 2009. This decrease in the effective tax rate impacts income tax expense by $9 million, and is primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the Separation on the availability of the manufacturers deduction for the pre Separation period and the non deductibility of certain Separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents of $2.063 billion at December 31, 2010 were invested in prime money market funds. Cash Flows Cash flow from operating activities. The principal source of liquidity for our business and operating needs is internally generated funds from our operations. We generated net cash flow from operations of $1.091 billion for 2010 compared to $1.037 million for 2009. The increased cash flow in 2010 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Net cash flow from operations was $1.037 million for 2009, compared to $980 million for 2008. The increased cash flow in 2009 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Cash flow from investing activities. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $40 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to $51 million for 2009. The decrease in cash flow used by investing activities in 2010 is due to decreased purchases of equipment. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $51 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to $201 million of cash provided in 2008. The decrease in cash flow provided by investing activities in 2009 is primarily due to no investment purchases and sales. Capital expenditures were $40 million, $51 million and $44 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expenditures were primarily for the modernization of manufacturing equipment. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecast to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash flow from financing activities. Our cash flow from operations has exceeded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. We paid cash dividends to Loews of $291 million and $200 million on January 24, 2008 and April 28, 2008, respectively. We paid cash dividends to shareholders of $158 million and $155 million on September 12, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively. In 2009, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $155 million, $163 million and $158 million on March 12, 2009, June 12, 2009, September 11, 2009 and December 11, 2009, respectively. In 2010, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $152 million, $171 million and $167 million on March 11, 2010, June 11, 2010, September 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, respectively. In April 2010, Lorillard Tobacco issued $1 billion of unsecured senior notes in two tranches pursuant to an Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated April 12, 2010 (the Second Supplemental Indenture). The first tranche was $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Notes due May 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes), and the second tranche was $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Notes due May 1, 2040 (the 2040 Notes). Lorillard Tobacco is the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company and the 2020 Notes and 2040 Notes (the Notes) are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. The net proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repurchase, redemption or retirement of securities including the Companys common stock, acquisitions, additions to working capital and capital expenditures. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, Lorillard Tobacco will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event occurs when there is both a change of control (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) and the Notes cease to be rated investment grade by both Moodys and SP within 60 days of the occurrence of a change of control or public announcement of the 34 Table of Contents intention to effect a change of control. The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity. The Notes contain covenants that restrict liens and sale and leaseback transactions, subject to a limited exception. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 9.0 million shares at a cost of $79.74 per share and totaling $716 million under the $1 billion repurchase program announced on August 20, 2010, the $250 million repurchase program announced February 25, 2010 and the $750 million repurchase program announced July 27, 2009. As of February 11, 2011, the maximum dollar value of shares that could yet be purchased under the $1 billion program was $444 million. Purchases by the Company under these programs were made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by the Companys management. The purchases were funded from existing cash balances, including proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock. The timing, frequency and amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for investment in the Companys business, current stock price, market conditions and other factors. Liquidity We believe that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable us to meet our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We cannot predict our cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, and can make no assurance that we will be able to meet all of those requirements. The rate of return on our pension assets in 2010 was a positive 11.9%. Our pension expense was approximately $17 million in 2010 and we anticipate pension expense of approximately $13 million in 2011. We contributed $19 million to our pension plans in 2010 and anticipate a contribution of $15 million in 2011. We believe that it is appropriate for a company of our size and financial characteristics to have a prudent level of debt as a component of our capital structure in order to reduce our total cost of capital and improve total shareholder returns. Accordingly, we raised $1 billion and $750 million of debt financing in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect that we will seek to raise additional debt financing in the future, although the structure, timing and amount of such indebtedness has not yet been determined and will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to the prevailing credit and interest rate environment, our cash requirements, and other business, financial and tax considerations. The proceeds of any such debt financing may be used to fund stock repurchases, acquisitions, dividends or for other general corporate purposes. We presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding any debt financing transactions and no assurance can be given that we will ultimately pursue any debt financing or, if pursued, that we will be able to obtain debt financing at the suggested levels or on attractive terms. In March 2010, Lorillard Tobacco, the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $185 million revolving credit facility (Revolver) that expires March 26, 2013 and is guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds from the Revolver may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The interest rates on borrowings under the Revolver will be based on prevailing interest rates and, in part, upon the credit rating applicable to the Companys senior unsecured long term debt. The Revolver requires that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to net income plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, any extraordinary losses, any non cash expenses or losses and any losses on sales of assets outside of the ordinary course of business (EBITDA) of not more than 2.25 to 1 and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. In addition, the Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and sale and leaseback transactions subject to a limited exception. The Revolver contains customary events of default, including upon a change in control that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding, if any, under the Revolver. 35 Table of Contents There were no borrowings under the Revolver during 2010. State Settlement Agreements The State Settlement Agreements require us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers (Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company) to make aggregate annual payments of $10.4 billion in perpetuity, subject to adjustment for several factors described below. In addition, the Original Participating Manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees, subject to an aggregate annual cap of $500 million. These payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the Original Participating Manufacturers. Our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years. Both the aggregate payment obligations of the Original Participating Manufacturers, and our payment obligations, individually, under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include: inflation; aggregate volume of Original Participating Manufacturers cigarette shipments; other Original Participating Manufacturers and our market share; and aggregate Original Participating Manufacturers operating income, allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases. The inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of 3.0% or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year. The inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for 1999. The volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the Original Participating Manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the 1997 base year shipments. If volume has increased, the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997 base number. If volume has decreased, the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by 98.0% of the percentage reduction in volume. In addition, downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may, subject to specified conditions and exceptions, be reduced in the event of an increase in the Original Participating Manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the State Settlement Agreements, adjusted for inflation. Any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those Original Participating Manufacturers who have had increases. During 2010, we paid $1.134 billion under the State Settlement Agreements, primarily based on 2009 volume. Included in the above number was $92 million we deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of a claim by us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers. Most of the states that are parties to the MSA are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings. Our $92 million reduction is based upon the Original Participating Manufacturers collective loss of market share in 2006. In April of 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had previously deposited $69 million, $72 million, $111 million and $109 million, respectively, in the same escrow account discussed above, which was based on a loss of market share in 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 to non participating manufacturers. In February 2009, we directed the transfer of $72 million from this account to the non disputed account, related to the loss of market share in 2005, pursuant to an Agreement Concerning Arbitration that we and other Participating Manufacturers entered into with certain MSA states. This amount was then paid to the MSA states. We and other Original Participating Manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of MSA payments in subsequent years under provisions of the MSA. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Payment Obligations The following table presents the contractual cash payment obligations of Lorillard as of December 31, 2010: More Less Than Than 5 Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years (In millions) Senior notes $ 1,750 $ $ $ $ 1,750 Interest payments related to notes 1,590 133 398 266 793 Contractual purchase obligations 55 55 Operating lease obligations 3 2 1 Total $ 3,398 $ 190 $ 399 $ 266 $ 2,543 In addition to the obligations presented in the table above, as of December 31, 2010, we believe that it is reasonably possible that payments of up to $0.6 million may be made to various tax authorities in the next twelve months related to gross unrecognized tax benefits. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months. As previously discussed, we have entered into the State Settlement Agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers. Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments, including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys, are based on a number of factors which are described above. Our cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2010 amounted to $1.134 billion and we estimate our cash payments in 2011 under the State Settlement Agreements will be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, primarily based on 2010 estimated industry volume. Payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table. Please see the discussion of the calculation of the Original Participating Manufacturers base payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements under State Settlement Agreements on page 36. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We invest in financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented below for each class of financial instrument we held at December 31, 2010, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. The market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate risk. Our investments, which are included in cash and cash equivalents, consist of money market funds with financial institutions. Those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our average 2010 investments, would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately $21 million. Our debt is denominated in US Dollars and has been issued at a fixed rate. In September 2009, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $750 million to hedge changes in fair value of the Notes due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings along with offsetting adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged debt. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% change in LIBOR, would cause an increase or decrease in pretax income of approximately $8 million for 2010. Liquidity risk. We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expiration date if our debt rating is downgraded below Ba2 by Moodys or BB by SP. This could have a negative impact on our cash position. Early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the debt. Our current Moodys debt rating is Baa2, and our current SP debt rating is BBB , both of which are above the ratings at which settlement of our derivative contracts would be required. See Note 10 for additional information on derivatives. 38 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Environment and Selected Industry and Market Share Data beginning on pages 28 and 30, respectively, for additional information. Legislation and Regulation Our business operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the research, development and manufacture of cigarettes; the development of new tobacco products; the publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging and advertising; the sale of tobacco products; restrictions on smoking in public places; and fire safety standards. From time to time, new legislation and regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulation of tobacco products. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals, reports and recommendations. If they are enacted or implemented, certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition or results of operations in the future. Federal Regulation The Federal Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, which became effective in 1985, requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements, on a rotating basis: (1) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, and may Complicate Pregnancy. (2) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health. (3) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight. (4) SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. 7 Table of Contents This law also requires that each company that manufactures, packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes. This list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients. In addition, bills have been introduced in Congress, including those that would: prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion; authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs; provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law; permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes; direct the placement of advertising of tobacco products; provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense; prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores, by mail or over the internet; impose additional, or increase existing, excise taxes on cigarettes and require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them, under certain circumstances, to be self extinguishing. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act that grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation: established a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to, among other things, evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA regarding menthol by March 23, 2011; grants the FDA the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process, including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes; requires larger and more severe health warnings, including graphic images, on packs, cartons, and advertising; bans the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and light; requires the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers; requires pre market approval by the FDA of all new products, including substantially equivalent products; requires pre market approval by the FDA for all claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; allows the FDA to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market; allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes; allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes; allows the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales of cigarettes; and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation. 8 Table of Contents The legislation permits the FDA to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes, including a ban, if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health. Any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. It is possible that such additional regulation, including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof, could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States (including sales of our brands), increased costs to us, and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Environmental Tobacco Smoke Various publications and studies by governmental entities have reported that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) presents health risks. In addition, public health organizations have issued statements on the adverse health effects of ETS, and scientific papers have been published that address the health problems associated with ETS exposure. Various states, cities and municipalities have restricted public smoking in recent years, and these restrictions have been based at least in part on the publications regarding the health risks believed to be associated with ETS exposure. The governmental entities that have published these reports have included the Surgeon General of the United States, first in 1986 and again in 2006. The 2006 report, for instance, concluded that there is no risk free level of exposure to ETS. In 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services listed ETS as a known human carcinogen. In 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded that ETS is a human lung carcinogen in adults and causes respiratory effects in children. Agencies of state governments also have issued publications regarding ETS, including reports by California entities that were published in 1997, 1999 and 2006. In the 2006 study, the California Air Resources Board determined that ETS is a toxic air contaminant. Based on these or other findings, public health concerns regarding ETS have lead and could continue to lead to the imposition of additional restrictions on public smoking, including bans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future. State and Local Regulation Many state, local and municipal governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking, including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace. This trend has increased significantly since the release of the EPAs report regarding ETS in 1993. Two states, Massachusetts and Texas, have enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents, and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands. Neither law allows for the public release of trade secret information. A New York law which became effective in June 2004 requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard for ignition propensity. We developed proprietary technology to comply with the standards and were compliant by the effective date. Since the passage of the New York law, an additional 48 states and the District of Columbia have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards. The effective dates of these laws range from May 2006 to January 2011. As of November 1, 2009, all of our cigarettes were manufactured using this technology. Other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments. We cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on our business, though if enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future. 9 Table of Contents Excise Taxes and Assessments Cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes in the United States and, in general, such taxes have been increasing. Effective April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes (or $1.0066 per pack of 20 cigarettes) from $19.50 per thousand cigarettes (or $0.39 per pack of 20 cigarettes). State excise taxes, which are levied upon and paid by the distributors, are also in effect in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and many municipalities. Increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in six states during 2010 and ranged from $0.40 per pack to $1.60 per pack. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the combined state and municipal taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack of cigarettes. A federal law enacted in October 2004 repealed the federal supply management program for tobacco growers and compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with payments to be funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers. Cigarette manufacturers and importers are responsible for paying 95.5% of a $10.14 billion payment to tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten year period. The law provides that payments will be based on shipments for domestic consumption. Separation Agreement with Loews Corporation In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation Agreement with Loews Corporation on May 7, 2008. The Separation Agreement sets forth the relationship between Lorillard and Loews following the Separation, including provisions relating to indemnification and tax allocation between the parties. Indemnification Provisions We agreed to indemnify Loews and its officers, directors, employees and agents against all costs and expenses arising out of third party claims (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, interest, penalties and costs of investigation or preparation for defense), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, taxes, demands, assessments and amounts paid in settlement based on, arising out of or resulting from: the ownership or the operation of our assets and properties, and the operation or conduct of our businesses at any time prior to or following the Separation (including with respect to any smoking and health claims and litigation); certain tax matters, as discussed below; any other activities in which we may engage; any action or omission by us (or any successor entity) that causes the Separation to become taxable to Loews; any breach by us of the Separation Agreement; any other acts or omissions by us arising out of the performance of our obligations under the Separation Agreement; misstatements in or omissions from the registration statement filed with regard to the Separation, other than misstatements or omissions made in reliance on information relating to and furnished by Loews for use in the preparation of such registration statement; and any taxes and related losses resulting from the receipt of any such indemnity payment. Our indemnification obligations, including the tax indemnification obligations described below, are binding on our successors. We are not permitted to merge, consolidate, transfer or convey all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity, transferee or successor expressly agrees in writing to be bound by these indemnification obligations. Any equity security or equity interest of Lorillard Licensing Company, LLC (Lorillard Licensing), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary and owner of our trademarks, or any interest in the intellectual property owned by Lorillard Licensing, is deemed a significant portion for purposes of the foregoing. 10 Table of Contents We also agreed to release Loews and its shareholders, officers, directors and employees from any liability owed by any of them to us with respect to acts or events occurring on or prior to the Separation date, except with respect to tax matters. The Separation Agreement also provides that Loews will indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees and agents against losses, including but not limited to, litigation matters, and other claims, based on, arising out of or resulting from: any activity that Loews and its subsidiaries (other than us) engage in; any breach by Loews of the Separation Agreement; any other acts or omissions by Loews arising out of the performance of its obligations under the Separation Agreement; and misstatements in or omissions from the registration statement filed with regard to the Separation, but only with respect to misstatements or omissions made in reliance on information relating to and furnished by Loews for use in the preparation of such registration statement. Loews agreed to release us and all of our directors, officers and employees from any liability owed by any of us to Loews with respect to acts or events occurring on or prior to the Separation date, except with respect to tax matters. Tax Allocation Provisions Following the Separation, we are no longer included in Loewss consolidated group for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the Separation, the Separation Agreement provides certain tax allocation arrangements, pursuant to which we will indemnify Loews for tax liabilities that are allocated to us for taxable periods ending on or before the Separation date. The amount of federal income taxes allocated to us for such periods is generally equal to the federal income taxes that would have been payable by us during such periods if we had filed separate consolidated returns. In addition, with respect to periods in which we were included in Loewss consolidated group, Loews will indemnify us with respect to the tax liability of the members of the Loews consolidated group other than us. After the Separation, we have the right to be notified of and participate in tax matters for which we are financially responsible under the terms of the Separation Agreement, although Loews will generally control such matters. The Separation Agreement requires us (and any successor entity) to indemnify Loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the Separation to qualify as a tax free transaction (except if the failure to qualify is solely due to Loewss fault). This indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above, or whether we or a potential successor obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel. The Separation Agreement further provides for cooperation between us and Loews with respect to additional tax matters, including the exchange of information and the retention of records which may affect the income tax liability of the parties to the Separation Agreement.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS FDA regulation of menthol in cigarettes and concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect our business. Some plaintiffs in our litigation and constituencies, including the FDA and other public health agencies, have claimed or expressed concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than non mentholated cigarettes, including concerns that mentholated cigarettes may make it easier to start smoking and harder to quit and may seek restrictions or a ban on the production and sale of mentholated cigarettes. Any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Following the passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in June 2009, the FDA established the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (the TPSAC) to evaluate, among other things, the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health, including such use among children, African Americans, Hispanics, and other racial and ethnic minorities. In addition, the FSPTCA permits the FDA to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes, including a ban, if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health. The TPSAC held meetings on March 30 31, 2010, July 15 16, 2010, September 27, 2010, October 7, 2010, November 18, 2010 and January 10 11, 2011 to consider the issues surrounding the use of menthol in cigarettes. TPSAC has scheduled further meetings on the use of menthol in cigarettes, and TPSACs report and nonbinding recommendations on menthol are currently due to the FDA by March 23, 2011. Since we are the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the United States, we could face increased exposure to tobacco related litigation as a result of such allegations. Even if such claims are unsubstantiated, increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could materially adversely affect our sales, including sales of Newport. A ban or limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes by the FDA would materially adversely affect our business. The regulation of cigarettes by the Food and Drug Administration may materially adversely affect our business. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act that grants the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation: established a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to, among other things, evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the FDA regarding menthol by March 23, 2011; grants the FDA the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process, including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes; requires larger and more severe health warnings, including graphic images, on packs, cartons and advertising; bans the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and light; requires the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers; requires pre market approval by the FDA of all new products, including substantially equivalent products; 12 Table of Contents requires pre market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; allows the FDA to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market; allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes; allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes; allows the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales of cigarettes; and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminates the existing federal preemption of such regulation. We believe that such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, under the FSPTCA, we must file a report with the FDA substantiating that any cigarettes introduced or modified after February 15, 2007 are substantially equivalent to cigarettes on the market before that date to enable the agency to determine whether the new or modified products are substantially equivalent to specific predicate products already being sold. For any products introduced or modified between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011, initial reports must be filed with the FDA before March 23, 2011. The FDA has announced that a product introduced or modified before March 22, 2011 may remain on the market pending the FDAs review, provided a substantially equivalent report has been filed with the FDA on or before March 22, 2011. We believe, based on the limited guidance issued by the FDA to date, that we must file reports for all of our cigarettes by March 23, 2011 since modifications have been made to our products since 2007. While all of our cigarettes may remain on the market pending the FDAs review, they are subject to removal should the FDA determine any are not substantially equivalent. The legislation also permits the FDA to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes, including a ban, if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health. Any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. It is possible that such additional regulation, including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof, could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States (including sales of our brands), increased costs to us and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As of February 9, 2011, Lorillard Tobacco is a defendant in approximately 9,758 tobacco related lawsuits, including approximately 701 cases in which Lorillard, Inc. is a co defendant. These cases, which are extremely costly to defend, could result in substantial judgments against Lorillard Tobacco and or Lorillard, Inc. Numerous legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc., and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future. In addition, several cases have been filed against Lorillard Tobacco and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of the MSA among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions, and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the MSA. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that the outcome of these cases, individually or in the aggregate, could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc. may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case. Even if Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc. are successful in defending some or all of these actions, these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, adverse decisions in litigations against other tobacco companies could have an adverse impact on the industry, including us. 13 Table of Contents A jury has returned verdicts that award damages from Lorillard Tobacco in a Conventional Product Liability Case. In December 2010, a Massachusetts jury awarded $50 million in compensatory damages to the estate of a deceased smoker, $21 million in damages to the deceased smokers son, and $81 million in punitive damages from Lorillard Tobacco in a Conventional Product Liability Case, Evans v. Lorillard Tobacco Company (Superior Court, Suffolk County, Massachusetts). As of February 9, 2011, the case remained pending before the trial court because the judge has not issued a verdict as to a single claim that was not submitted for the jurys consideration. It is possible the court will award additional damages to the plaintiffs in its verdict that addresses this final claim. As of February 9, 2011, the court had not ruled on the motions filed by Lorillard Tobacco following the verdicts, which includes motions for new trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for reduction or elimination of the jurys damages awards. The court is not expected to issue a final judgment until it disposes of the final claim or it rules on Lorillard Tobaccos post trial motions. Lorillard Tobacco may file additional post trial motions after a final judgment is entered. Should the final judgment award damages to the plaintiff, Massachusetts statutes provide that the court may award prejudgment and post judgment interest. The opportunity for Lorillard Tobacco to initiate an appeal from the verdicts in Evans will not begin until the final judgment is entered. Plaintiff has asked the court to enter a preliminary injunction that directs Lorillard Tobacco to set aside $272 million in cash or cash equivalents to secure the amounts awarded by the jury and the interest obligations plaintiff expects the court to order in a final judgment. As of February 9, 2011, the court had not ruled on plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction. It is possible that the verdict in this case could lead to additional litigation. A judgment has been rendered against Lorillard Tobacco in the Scott litigation. In July 2008, the District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, entered an amended final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al. (District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996), a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana. In April 2010, the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, issued a decision that modified the trial courts 2008 amended final judgment. The Court of Appeals decision reduced the judgment amount to approximately $242 million to fund a ten year court supervised smoking cessation program. The April 2010 decision ordered that an award of post judgment interest will accrue from July 2008. Interest awarded by the amended final judgment will continue to accrue from July 2008 until the judgment either is paid or is reversed on appeal. As of February 9, 2011, judicial interest totaled approximately $32.1 million. Lorillard Tobaccos share of any judgment, including an award of post judgment interest, has not been determined. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a pretax provision of approximately $66 million for this matter. Lorillard, Inc., which was a party to the case in the past, is no longer a defendant. The U.S. Supreme Court has granted defendants application to stay execution of the amended final judgment until defendants petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court is resolved. As of February 9, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court had not determined whether it will grant review of defendants certiorari petition. It is not possible to predict the final outcome of this matter. The Florida Supreme Courts ruling in Engle has resulted in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including us. The case of Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. (Circuit Court, Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994) was certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to smoking. The case was tried between 1998 and 2000 in a multi phase trial that resulted in verdicts in favor of the class. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that, among other things, determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action. In February 2008, the trial court entered an order on remand from the Florida Supreme Court that formally decertified the class. The 2006 ruling by the Florida Supreme Court in Engle also permitted members of the Engle class to file individual claims, including claims for punitive damages. The Florida Supreme Court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely on a number of the jurys findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase of 14 Table of Contents the Engle trial. These findings included that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases; that cigarettes are addictive or dependence producing; and that the defendants, including Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc., were negligent, breached express and implied warranties, placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking. Lorillard Tobacco is a defendant in approximately 7,100 cases pending in various state and federal courts in Florida that were filed by members of the Engle class (the Engle Progeny Cases), including 695 cases in which Lorillard, Inc. is a co defendant. As of February 9, 2011, Lorillard Tobacco was a defendant in one Engle Progeny Case in which trial was underway. Lorillard, Inc. is not a defendant in this trial. Neither Lorillard Tobacco nor Lorillard, Inc. were defendants in three additional Engle Progeny Cases in which trial was underway as of February 9, 2011. In addition, Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard, Inc. are defendants in Engle Progeny Cases that have been placed on courts 2011 trial calendars or in which specific trial dates have been set. Trial schedules are subject to change and it is not possible to predict how many of the Engle Progeny Cases pending against Lorillard Tobacco or Lorillard, Inc. will be tried during 2011. It also is not possible to predict whether some courts will implement procedures that consolidate multiple Engle Progeny Cases for trial. As of February 9, 2011, verdicts have been returned in 32 Engle Progeny Cases since the Florida Supreme Court issued its 2006 ruling. Lorillard Tobacco was a defendant in one of the 32 trials. As of February 9, 2011, Lorillard, Inc. had not been a defendant in any of the trials in which verdicts were returned. Juries awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages in 14 of these trials. The punitive damages awards have totaled $527 million and have ranged from $270,000 to $244 million. In six of the trials, juries awarded only compensatory damages. In the twelve other trials, juries found in favor of the defendants. In the single trial in which Lorillard Tobacco had been a defendant as of February 9, 2011, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. In some of the trials decided in the defendants favor, plaintiffs have filed motions challenging the verdicts. It is not possible to predict the final outcome of this litigation. The judgment entered in the federal governments reimbursement case, while not final in all respects, could restrict or limit our defenses in other litigation. In August 2006, a final judgment and remedial order was entered in United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. (U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). The court based its final judgment and remedial order on the governments only remaining claims, which were based on the defendants alleged violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Lorillard, Inc. is not a party to this matter, but Lorillard Tobacco is one of the defendants in the case. Although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial order imposed a number of requirements on the defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. In 2009, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals upheld substantially all of the District Courts final judgment and remedial order. In June 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties petitions seeking review of the case. The case has been returned to the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia for implementation of the Court of Appeals directions in its 2009 ruling and for entry of an amended final judgment. As of February 9, 2011, the trial court had not entered the amended final judgment. The 2006 final judgment and remedial order made many adverse findings regarding the conduct of the defendants. It is possible that the final opinion, final judgment and remedial order entered by the court could form the basis of allegations by the plaintiffs in other matters, or of additional judicial findings by other courts against cigarette manufacturers. It is possible that other courts could apply the findings in the United States of America case to restrict or otherwise limit our defenses in other litigation. 15 Table of Contents A ruling by the United States Supreme Court could limit the ability of cigarette manufacturers to contend that certain claims asserted against them in product liability litigation are barred. The Supreme Courts decision also could encourage litigation involving cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar. In December 2008, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision that neither the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act nor the Federal Trade Commissions regulation of cigarettes tar and nicotine disclosures preempts (or bars) some of plaintiffs claims. The decision also more broadly addresses the scope of preemption based on the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, and could significantly limit cigarette manufacturers arguments that certain of plaintiffs other claims in smoking and health litigation, including claims based on the alleged concealment of information with respect to the hazards of smoking, are preempted. In addition, the Supreme Courts ruling could encourage litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including us, regarding the sale of cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar, and it may limit cigarette manufacturers ability to defend such claims. The Supreme Court issued this ruling in a purported lights class action, Good v. Altria Group, Inc. We were not a defendant in Good. The U.S. Surgeon General has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes, and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. In a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General summarized conclusions from previous Surgeon Generals reports concerning the health effects of exposure to second hand smoke by non smokers. According to this report, scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions: Second hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke. Children exposed to second hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections and ear problems. Exposure of adults to second hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer. The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk free level of exposure to second hand smoke. Many millions of Americans, both children and adults, are exposed to second hand smoke in their homes and workplaces. Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non smokers from exposure to second hand smoke. Separating smokers from non smokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non smokers to second hand smoke. This report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including us. The report could be used to support existing litigation against us or other cigarette manufacturers. It also is possible that the Surgeon Generals report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. It is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of our brands. These developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We have substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and operating income in future periods. In 1998, Lorillard Tobacco, Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the Original Participating Manufacturers) entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (the Initial State Settlements and, together with the MSA, are referred to as the State Settlement Agreements). 16 Table of Contents Under the State Settlement Agreements, we paid $1.134 billion in 2010 and are obligated to pay between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2011, primarily based on 2010 estimated industry volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on our domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments, with respect to the MSA, in the year preceding the year in which payment is due, and, with respect to the Initial State Settlements, in the year in which payment is due. We are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of certain material pending litigation. We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements and the provision relating to the Scott case, as described in the risk factor A judgment has been rendered against Lorillard Tobacco in the Scott litigation above, we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation. We face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors introduction of low priced products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco. We also compete against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes. If our major competitors were to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers, we could respond by increasing price discounts, which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We are subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm our competitive position. Television and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since 1971. Under the State Settlement Agreements, we generally cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of concerts, non tobacco merchandise bearing Lorillards brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. In addition, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products. Accordingly, we have determined not to advertise our cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. On June 22, 2009 the federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law granting authority over the regulation of tobacco products to the FDA. Pursuant to the FSPTCA, the FDA reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in 1995 as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The FSPTCA contains other restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sale of cigarette products more stringent than those found in the original FDA rule. In addition, many states, cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising, marketing and sales promotions, and others may do so in the future. Additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including us, to launch new premium brands. 17 Table of Contents Changes in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition to the regulation of our business by the FDA, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by new or future legal requirements imposed by legislative or regulatory initiatives, including but not limited to those relating to health care reform, climate change and environmental matters. For example, the health care reform legislation, which was signed into law in March 2010, resulted in the repeal of $2 million of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for our retiree drug benefits and could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits, employer sponsored medical plans and related matters in future periods. However, the extent of that impact, if any, cannot be determined until regulations are promulgated and additional interpretations of the health care law are available. New legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase the prices of goods and services because of increased costs or reduced availability. We cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory initiatives will result in significant changes to existing laws and regulations and or whether any changes in such laws or regulations will have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes. On April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased $0.6166 per pack to $1.0066 per pack to finance health insurance for children. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack. Various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes substantially in recent years. In addition, increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in six states during 2010 and ranged from $0.40 per pack to $1.60 per pack. It is our expectation that several states will propose further increases in 2011 and in subsequent years. We believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes. In addition, we believe that the 2009 increase in the federal excise tax, as well as possible future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, compounded by poor economic conditions, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including us, and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. We are dependent on the domestic cigarette business, which we expect to continue to contract. Although we conduct business in Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, our cigarette business in the 50 states of the United States (the domestic cigarette market) is currently our only significant business. The domestic cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue to contract. We do not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects, as we sold the international rights to substantially all of our brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors, industry wide domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately 3.5% during the period 2000 through 2010. Industry wide domestic cigarette shipments decreased by an estimated 3.8% for 2010 compared to 2009, 8.6% for 2009 compared to 2008, 3.3% for 2008 to 2007 and 5.0% during 2007, compared to 2006. We derive most of our revenue from one brand. Our largest selling brand, Newport, accounted for approximately 90.0% of our sales revenue for 2010. Our principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales promotion in support of the Newport brand. We cannot ensure that we will continue to successfully implement our strategic plan with respect to Newport or that implementation of our strategic plan will result in the maintenance or growth of the Newport brand. 18 Table of Contents The use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on our business. Since 1998, the cigarette market has been increasingly price competitive due to the impact of, among other things, higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands. In response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures, we have engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives. The cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on our business. We regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods. We rely on a limited number of key executives and may continue to experience difficulty in attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business. The loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business. As a tobacco company, we may experience difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified executives and other personnel in some areas of our business. This difficulty is primarily attributable to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. The loss of services of any key personnel or our inability to attract and hire personnel with requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products, enhance existing products in a timely manner, sell products or manage our business effectively. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences. Consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require us to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products. For example, 49 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products. We believe that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette, an alternative cigarette or an alternative tobacco product that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects. Certain of the other major cigarette makers have already developed and marketed alternative cigarette products. We may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers. In addition, the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial. Increased restrictions on smoking in public places could adversely affect our sales volume, revenue and profitability. In recent years, states and many local and municipal governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict, or discourage smoking; smoking in public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars; and smoking on airline flights and in the workplace. Other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by state and local governments in the future. Although we have no empirical evidence of the effect of such restrictions, we believe that restrictions on smoking in public and other places may lead to a decrease in the number of people who smoke or a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers. Increased restrictions on smoking in public and other places may have caused a decrease, and may continue to cause a decrease in the volume of cigarettes that would otherwise be sold by us absent such restrictions, which may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits. The availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect our sales volume, revenue and profitability. Sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the United States, including counterfeits of our Newport brand, could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands. Additionally, smokers who mistake counterfeit cigarettes for our 19 Table of Contents cigarettes may attribute quality and taste deficiencies in the counterfeit product to our brands and discontinue purchasing our brands. Although we do not believe that sales of counterfeit Newport cigarettes have had a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits to date, the availability of counterfeit Newport cigarettes together with substantial increases in excise taxes and other potential price increases could result in increased demand for counterfeit product that could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits in the future. We rely on a single manufacturing facility for the production of our cigarettes. We produce all of our cigarettes at our Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing facility. If our manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or incapacitated or we are otherwise unable to operate our manufacturing facility, we may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits. We rely on a small number of suppliers for certain of our domestic leaf tobacco and reconstituted tobacco. We purchase approximately 66% of our domestic leaf tobacco through one supplier, Alliance One International, Inc. If Alliance One becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us, we believe that leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to Alliance One, which could have a material adverse effect on our future profits. In addition, we purchase all of our reconstituted tobacco from one supplier, which is an affiliate of RAI, one of our major competitors. Reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems, and which is used as a component of cigarette blends. If RAI becomes unwilling or unable to supply us and we are unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis, our operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, revenue and profits in the future. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business. Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. Our ability to maintain and further build brand recognition is dependent on the continued and exclusive use of our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logo and the unique features of our tobacco products. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are ineffective, thereby permitting a third party to misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from growing or maintaining market share. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our Common Stock. Our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include: a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms; elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent; rules regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors. 20 Table of Contents Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding Common Stock. We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our board with time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to prevent such takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests and those of our shareholders. The Separation Agreement between us and Loews contains provisions that may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us. The tax free nature of the Separation may be affected by certain transactions undertaken by us. In particular, under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Separation would become taxable to Loews if it was determined that 50% or more of the shares of our Common Stock were acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the Separation. If, as a result of acquisitions of our Common Stock subsequent to the Separation, the Separation becomes taxable pursuant to Section 355(e), Loews would recognize a substantial gain for tax purposes as the Separation would be treated as a sale of Lorillard for federal income tax purposes. The Separation Agreement requires us (and any successor entity) to indemnify Loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the Separation to qualify as a tax free transaction (except if the failure to qualify is solely due to Loewss fault). This indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above, or whether we or a potential acquirer obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel. These restrictions and potential indemnification obligations may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us. We are required to indemnify Loews against losses and other expenses incurred at any time (including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation) with respect to our assets, properties and businesses. In the Separation Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Loews and its officers, directors, employees and agents against costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, litigation matters and other claims) based on, arising out of or resulting from, among other things, the ownership or the operation of us and our assets and properties, and the operation or conduct of us and our businesses at any time prior to or following the Separation (including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation). If Loews incurs legal or other fees or costs and expenses resulting from the operation of our businesses or otherwise with respect to us, we are required to reimburse Loews for such losses and any legal or other fees related thereto, which could be substantial. These indemnification obligations may discourage third parties from trying to acquire us because our indemnification obligations are binding on our successors and we are prohibited by the Separation Agreement from merging, consolidating or transferring all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity, transferee or successor agrees to be bound by these indemnification obligations. In addition, we could face substantial charges for indemnification payments to Loews, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We do not believe the Separation has altered or will alter our legal exposure with respect to tobacco related claims. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item 2.

Our Common Stock began trading regular way on the NYSE under the symbol LO on June 10, 2008. There were 68 shareholders of record as of February 11, 2011. This figure excludes any estimate of the indeterminate number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies. The following table presents the high and low sales prices of our Common Stock on the NYSE as well as cash dividends declared per share during the fiscal quarters indicated: Cash Dividends Price per Share Declared Common Stock Market Price High Low per Share 2010 Fourth Quarter $ 89.71 $ 78.54 $ 1.125 Third Quarter 83.03 70.87 1.125 Second Quarter 82.26 70.24 1.00 First Quarter 81.74 72.07 1.00 2009 Fourth Quarter $ 81.76 $ 73.61 $ 1.00 Third Quarter 78.57 66.46 1.00 Second Quarter 69.94 58.73 0.92 First Quarter 67.00 52.51 0.92 Dividend Policy Lorillards current policy is to return approximately 70 75% of its earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends over the long term. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our Common Stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a holding company with no material liquid assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the receipt of dividends from our operating subsidiaries. In 2010, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $152 million, $171 million and $167 million on March 11, 2010, June 11, 2010, September 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, respectively. In 2009, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $155 million, $163 million and $158 million on March 12, 2009, June 12, 2009, September 11, 2009 and December 11, 2009, respectively. In 2008, we paid cash dividends to Loews of $291 million and $200 million on January 24, 2008 and April 28, 2008, respectively, prior to the Separation. Following the Separation, we paid cash dividends of $158 million and $155 million to shareholders on September 12, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. 23 Table of Contents Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our Common Stock from June 10, 2008, the date our Common Stock commenced trading on a when issued basis, to December 31, 2010 with the comparable cumulative return of (i) the SP 500 Index and (ii) the SP Tobacco Index.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes related to those financial statements and Item 6. Selected Financial Data appearing herein. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the Forward Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Business Environment and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include: (1) accruals for tobacco settlement costs, legal expenses and litigation costs, sales incentive programs, income taxes and share based compensation, (2) the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and (3) the valuation of pension assets. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Tobacco Settlement Costs In 1998, we and the other Original Participating Manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (which are referred to as the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, are referred to as the State Settlement Agreements). Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments, with respect to the MSA, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due, and, with respect to the Initial State Settlements, in the year in which payment is due. We record our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped. Please read State Settlement Agreements beginning on page 36 for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Tobacco and Other Litigation We and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages, return of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages. We believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us. We also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us. While we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. We may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements and the provision relating to the Scott case, as described in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76, our management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation. Defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling, general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred. Defense costs may increase in future periods, in part, as a result of the Engle Progeny Cases as described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period. The principal factors are as follows: the number and types of cases filed and appealed; the number of cases tried and appealed; the development of the law; the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel; and litigation strategy and tactics. Please read Note 19 Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76 for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations We are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense. In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The discount rate was determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation, discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date, and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation. 27 Table of Contents The salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook. Long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, asset allocations and managements expectation of the future economic environment. Our major assumptions are set forth in Note 13 to our Consolidated Audited Financial Statements beginning on page 56. For 2010, hypothetical changes in the assumptions we used for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense: A decrease of 25 basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; and An increase of 25 basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately $1 million. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740 prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis, or market. The inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although, due to the duration of the aging processes, a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Recently adopted accounting pronouncements in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 47. Business Environment Participants in the U.S. tobacco industry, including us, face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so, including: A substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars, as well as equitable and injunctive relief, arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes, addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights, as well as other alleged damages. Substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity, and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of certain settlement agreements, including the Master Settlement Agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions (the MSA) that we entered into in 1998 along with Philip 28 Table of Contents Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the other Original Participating Manufacturers) to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, the State Settlement Agreements). The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes. The domestic cigarette market, in which we currently conduct our only significant business, continues to contract. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising, promotions and smoking in public and private facilities, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors, domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately 3.5% from 2000 through 2010. Increases in cigarette prices since 1998 have led to an increase in the volume of discount and, specifically, deep discount cigarettes. Cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in federal, state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases. Price increases have led, and continue to lead, to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands. Deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share in 1998 of less than 2.0% to an estimated 14.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic market. We do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking, but it is likely that increased prices may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so. The tobacco industry is subject to substantial and increasing regulation. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granting the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. Pursuant to the terms of the FSPTCA, the FDA could promulgate regulations that could, among other things, result in a ban on or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes. The law imposes and will impose new restrictions on the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, require larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging, permit restriction of the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured. In August 2009, we, along with RJR Tobacco, other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the FDA challenging the constitutionality of certain restrictions on speech included in the FSPTCA. These restrictions on speech include, among others, bans on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising, limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products, a prohibition on making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products, restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising, a ban on certain promotions offering gifts in consideration for the purchase of tobacco products, a ban on brand name sponsorship of events and the sale of brand name merchandise, and a ban on the distribution of product samples. The suit also challenges the laws requirement for extensive graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising. The complaint seeks a judgment (i) declaring that such provisions of the law violate the First and or Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and (ii) enjoining the FDA from enforcing the unconstitutional provisions of the law. On January 4, 2010, the district court issued an order (a) striking down the provisions of the law that banned the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising and prohibited tobacco manufacturers from making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products and (b) upholding the remaining challenged advertising provisions. Both sides have appealed the district courts ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the appeal has been fully briefed. While we believe there is established legal precedent supporting our claims we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeal. Nor can we make any assurances that any such appeal will be successful. 29 Table of Contents The federal government and many state and local governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict or discourage smoking, including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars, on airline flights and in the workplace. Other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by federal, state and local governments in the future. Substantial federal, state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes. As of April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax was $1.0066 per pack and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, excise tax increases ranging from $0.40 to $1.60 per pack were implemented in six states and the District of Columbia. Congress enacted and the President signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes by $0.6166 per pack to $1.0066 per pack, effective April 1, 2009, to finance health insurance for children. It is likely that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the most recent increase and future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including us, and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. In addition, we and other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers. The domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is primarily based on a brands taste; quality; price, including the level of discounting and other promotional activities; positioning; consumer loyalty; and retail display. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco. We also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes, including deep discount cigarette manufacturers. We believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands. As a result, in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs, which may constrain sales.

(MSAI), an independent third party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers. MSAI divides the 30 Table of Contents cigarette market into two price segments, the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment. MSAIs information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates derived by MSAI. Management believes that volume and market share information for deep discount manufacturers may be understated and, correspondingly, market share information for the larger manufacturers, including Lorillard, may be overstated by MSAI. Lorillard has made certain adjustments to the data received from MSAI to reflect managements judgment as to which brands are included in the menthol segment. (2) Source: Lorillard shipment reports. Income Statement Captions Net sales includes revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, and is recognized at the time that ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis, and are included in both net sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Cost of sales includes federal excise taxes, leaf tobacco cost, wrapping and casing material, manufacturing labor and production salaries, wages and overhead, depreciation related to manufacturing plant and equipment, research and development costs, distribution, other manufacturing costs, State Settlement Agreement expenses, the federal assessment for tobacco growers and promotional product expenses. Promotional product expenses include the cost, including all applicable excise taxes, of the free portion of buy some get some free promotions. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes sales force expenses, legal and other costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, administrative expenses and advertising and marketing costs. Advertising and marketing costs include items such as direct mail, advertising, agency fees and point of sale materials. Investment income includes interest and dividend income, realized gains and losses on sale of investments and equity in the earnings of limited partnership investments. Interest expense includes interest expense related to debt and income taxes. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2009 2010 2009 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,879 and $1,547) $ 5,932 $ 5,233 Cost of sales 3,809 3,327 Gross profit 2,123 1,906 Selling, general and administrative 398 365 Operating income 1,725 1,541 Investment income 4 5 Interest expense (94 ) (27 ) Income before income taxes 1,635 1,519 Income taxes 606 571 Net income $ 1,029 $ 948 Net sales. Net sales increased by $699 million, or 13.4%, from $5.233 billion in 2009 to $5.932 billion in 2010. Net sales increased $287 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009, 31 Table of Contents $287 million due to higher unit sales volume and $80 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in February and March 2009 and February, May and November 2010 and $45 million of lower sales incentives in 2010. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume increased 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Total Newport unit volume increased 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 31.5% in 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding the launch of Newport Non Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010, Newports domestic wholesale unit shipments increased 1.2% during the current year. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 3.8% during 2010 compared to 2009. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.2% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2010 compared to 70.5% during 2009. Our total domestic wholesale market share, based on wholesale shipments, increased by 1.0 share point during 2010 to 12.3% from 11.3% in 2009. Total Newport domestic wholesale market share increased by 0.7 share points during 2010 to 10.5% from 9.8% in 2009. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $482 million, or 14.5%, from $3.327 billion in 2009 to $3.809 billion in 2010. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($287 million), higher unit sales volume ($67 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($7 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($84 million), higher Food and Drug Administration fees ($26 million) and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers ($11 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.212 billion and $1.128 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of $84 million. The $84 million increase is due to the impact of higher unit sales ($54), the impact of the inflation adjustment ($32 million), partially offset by other adjustments ($2 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 9.0%, from $365 million in 2009 to $398 million in 2010 as a result of higher legal and compensation costs incurred in the current year. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $67 million in 2010, compared to 2009, and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2010. Income taxes. Income taxes increased $35 million or 6.1%, from $571 million in 2009 to $606 million in 2010. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $116 million in 2010 or 7.6%, offset partially by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 37.6% to 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The decrease was driven by a statutory increase in the manufacturers deduction, offset partially by the unfavorable impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted during the first quarter of 2010. 32 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,547 and $712) $ 5,233 $ 4,204 Cost of sales 3,327 2,434 Gross profit 1,906 1,770 Selling, general and administrative 365 355 Operating income 1,541 1,415 Investment income 5 20 Interest expense (27 ) (1 ) Income before income taxes 1,519 1,434 Income taxes 571 547 Net income $ 948 $ 887 Net sales. Net sales increased by $1.029 billion, or 24.5%, from $4.204 billion in 2008 to $5.233 billion in 2009. Net sales increased $835 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009 and $533 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in May and December 2008 and February and March 2009, partially offset by $251 million due to lower unit sales volume and $88 million of higher sales incentives. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume decreased 3.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Our domestic wholesale shipments in 2009 reflect the negative impact of the federal excise tax increase implemented on April 1, 2009. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Newport unit volume decreased 6.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 8.6% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.5% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2009 compared to 72.7% during 2008. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $893 million, or 36.7%, from $2.434 billion in 2008 to $3.327 billion in 2009. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($835 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($74 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($11 million), the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees ($9 million) and higher pension expense ($15 million), partially offset by lower unit sales volume ($34 million) and the absence of free product promotions ($17 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.128 billion and $1.117 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of $11 million. The $11 million increase is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment ($30 million) and other adjustments ($24 million), partially offset by lower unit sales ($43 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10 million, or 2.8%, from $355 million in 2008 to $365 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses of $18 million due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle Progeny Cases and higher pension expense of $8 million, partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs of $6 million and the absence of an $18 million charge in 2008 related to the Separation. Investment income. Investment income decreased $15 million in 2009, compared to 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $26 million in 2009, compared to 2008, and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements. 33 Table of Contents Income taxes. Income taxes increased $24 million or 4.4% from $547 million in 2008 to $571 million in 2009. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $85 million in 2009 or 5.9% partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 38.2% in 2008 to 37.6% in 2009. This decrease in the effective tax rate impacts income tax expense by $9 million, and is primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the Separation on the availability of the manufacturers deduction for the pre Separation period and the non deductibility of certain Separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents of $2.063 billion at December 31, 2010 were invested in prime money market funds. Cash Flows Cash flow from operating activities. The principal source of liquidity for our business and operating needs is internally generated funds from our operations. We generated net cash flow from operations of $1.091 billion for 2010 compared to $1.037 million for 2009. The increased cash flow in 2010 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Net cash flow from operations was $1.037 million for 2009, compared to $980 million for 2008. The increased cash flow in 2009 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Cash flow from investing activities. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $40 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to $51 million for 2009. The decrease in cash flow used by investing activities in 2010 is due to decreased purchases of equipment. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $51 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to $201 million of cash provided in 2008. The decrease in cash flow provided by investing activities in 2009 is primarily due to no investment purchases and sales. Capital expenditures were $40 million, $51 million and $44 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expenditures were primarily for the modernization of manufacturing equipment. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecast to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash flow from financing activities. Our cash flow from operations has exceeded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. We paid cash dividends to Loews of $291 million and $200 million on January 24, 2008 and April 28, 2008, respectively. We paid cash dividends to shareholders of $158 million and $155 million on September 12, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively. In 2009, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $155 million, $163 million and $158 million on March 12, 2009, June 12, 2009, September 11, 2009 and December 11, 2009, respectively. In 2010, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $152 million, $171 million and $167 million on March 11, 2010, June 11, 2010, September 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, respectively. In April 2010, Lorillard Tobacco issued $1 billion of unsecured senior notes in two tranches pursuant to an Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated April 12, 2010 (the Second Supplemental Indenture). The first tranche was $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Notes due May 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes), and the second tranche was $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Notes due May 1, 2040 (the 2040 Notes). Lorillard Tobacco is the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company and the 2020 Notes and 2040 Notes (the Notes) are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. The net proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repurchase, redemption or retirement of securities including the Companys common stock, acquisitions, additions to working capital and capital expenditures. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, Lorillard Tobacco will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event occurs when there is both a change of control (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) and the Notes cease to be rated investment grade by both Moodys and SP within 60 days of the occurrence of a change of control or public announcement of the 34 Table of Contents intention to effect a change of control. The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity. The Notes contain covenants that restrict liens and sale and leaseback transactions, subject to a limited exception. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 9.0 million shares at a cost of $79.74 per share and totaling $716 million under the $1 billion repurchase program announced on August 20, 2010, the $250 million repurchase program announced February 25, 2010 and the $750 million repurchase program announced July 27, 2009. As of February 11, 2011, the maximum dollar value of shares that could yet be purchased under the $1 billion program was $444 million. Purchases by the Company under these programs were made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by the Companys management. The purchases were funded from existing cash balances, including proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock. The timing, frequency and amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for investment in the Companys business, current stock price, market conditions and other factors. Liquidity We believe that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable us to meet our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We cannot predict our cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, and can make no assurance that we will be able to meet all of those requirements. The rate of return on our pension assets in 2010 was a positive 11.9%. Our pension expense was approximately $17 million in 2010 and we anticipate pension expense of approximately $13 million in 2011. We contributed $19 million to our pension plans in 2010 and anticipate a contribution of $15 million in 2011. We believe that it is appropriate for a company of our size and financial characteristics to have a prudent level of debt as a component of our capital structure in order to reduce our total cost of capital and improve total shareholder returns. Accordingly, we raised $1 billion and $750 million of debt financing in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect that we will seek to raise additional debt financing in the future, although the structure, timing and amount of such indebtedness has not yet been determined and will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to the prevailing credit and interest rate environment, our cash requirements, and other business, financial and tax considerations. The proceeds of any such debt financing may be used to fund stock repurchases, acquisitions, dividends or for other general corporate purposes. We presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding any debt financing transactions and no assurance can be given that we will ultimately pursue any debt financing or, if pursued, that we will be able to obtain debt financing at the suggested levels or on attractive terms. In March 2010, Lorillard Tobacco, the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $185 million revolving credit facility (Revolver) that expires March 26, 2013 and is guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds from the Revolver may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The interest rates on borrowings under the Revolver will be based on prevailing interest rates and, in part, upon the credit rating applicable to the Companys senior unsecured long term debt. The Revolver requires that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to net income plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, any extraordinary losses, any non cash expenses or losses and any losses on sales of assets outside of the ordinary course of business (EBITDA) of not more than 2.25 to 1 and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. In addition, the Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and sale and leaseback transactions subject to a limited exception. The Revolver contains customary events of default, including upon a change in control that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding, if any, under the Revolver. 35 Table of Contents There were no borrowings under the Revolver during 2010. State Settlement Agreements The State Settlement Agreements require us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers (Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company) to make aggregate annual payments of $10.4 billion in perpetuity, subject to adjustment for several factors described below. In addition, the Original Participating Manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees, subject to an aggregate annual cap of $500 million. These payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the Original Participating Manufacturers. Our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years. Both the aggregate payment obligations of the Original Participating Manufacturers, and our payment obligations, individually, under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include: inflation; aggregate volume of Original Participating Manufacturers cigarette shipments; other Original Participating Manufacturers and our market share; and aggregate Original Participating Manufacturers operating income, allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases. The inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of 3.0% or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year. The inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for 1999. The volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the Original Participating Manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the 1997 base year shipments. If volume has increased, the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997 base number. If volume has decreased, the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by 98.0% of the percentage reduction in volume. In addition, downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may, subject to specified conditions and exceptions, be reduced in the event of an increase in the Original Participating Manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the State Settlement Agreements, adjusted for inflation. Any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those Original Participating Manufacturers who have had increases. During 2010, we paid $1.134 billion under the State Settlement Agreements, primarily based on 2009 volume. Included in the above number was $92 million we deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of a claim by us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers. Most of the states that are parties to the MSA are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings. Our $92 million reduction is based upon the Original Participating Manufacturers collective loss of market share in 2006. In April of 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had previously deposited $69 million, $72 million, $111 million and $109 million, respectively, in the same escrow account discussed above, which was based on a loss of market share in 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 to non participating manufacturers. In February 2009, we directed the transfer of $72 million from this account to the non disputed account, related to the loss of market share in 2005, pursuant to an Agreement Concerning Arbitration that we and other Participating Manufacturers entered into with certain MSA states. This amount was then paid to the MSA states. We and other Original Participating Manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of MSA payments in subsequent years under provisions of the MSA. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Payment Obligations The following table presents the contractual cash payment obligations of Lorillard as of December 31, 2010: More Less Than Than 5 Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years (In millions) Senior notes $ 1,750 $ $ $ $ 1,750 Interest payments related to notes 1,590 133 398 266 793 Contractual purchase obligations 55 55 Operating lease obligations 3 2 1 Total $ 3,398 $ 190 $ 399 $ 266 $ 2,543 In addition to the obligations presented in the table above, as of December 31, 2010, we believe that it is reasonably possible that payments of up to $0.6 million may be made to various tax authorities in the next twelve months related to gross unrecognized tax benefits. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months. As previously discussed, we have entered into the State Settlement Agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers. Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments, including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys, are based on a number of factors which are described above. Our cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2010 amounted to $1.134 billion and we estimate our cash payments in 2011 under the State Settlement Agreements will be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, primarily based on 2010 estimated industry volume. Payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table. Please see the discussion of the calculation of the Original Participating Manufacturers base payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements under State Settlement Agreements on page 36. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We invest in financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented below for each class of financial instrument we held at December 31, 2010, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. The market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate risk. Our investments, which are included in cash and cash equivalents, consist of money market funds with financial institutions. Those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our average 2010 investments, would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately $21 million. Our debt is denominated in US Dollars and has been issued at a fixed rate. In September 2009, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $750 million to hedge changes in fair value of the Notes due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings along with offsetting adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged debt. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% change in LIBOR, would cause an increase or decrease in pretax income of approximately $8 million for 2010. Liquidity risk. We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expiration date if our debt rating is downgraded below Ba2 by Moodys or BB by SP. This could have a negative impact on our cash position. Early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the debt. Our current Moodys debt rating is Baa2, and our current SP debt rating is BBB , both of which are above the ratings at which settlement of our derivative contracts would be required. See Note 10 for additional information on derivatives. 38 Table of Contents

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes related to those financial statements and Item 6. Selected Financial Data appearing herein. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the Forward Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Business Environment and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include: (1) accruals for tobacco settlement costs, legal expenses and litigation costs, sales incentive programs, income taxes and share based compensation, (2) the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and (3) the valuation of pension assets. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Tobacco Settlement Costs In 1998, we and the other Original Participating Manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (which are referred to as the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, are referred to as the State Settlement Agreements). Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments, with respect to the MSA, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due, and, with respect to the Initial State Settlements, in the year in which payment is due. We record our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped. Please read State Settlement Agreements beginning on page 36 for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Tobacco and Other Litigation We and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages, return of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages. We believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us. We also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us. While we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. We may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements and the provision relating to the Scott case, as described in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76, our management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation. Defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling, general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred. Defense costs may increase in future periods, in part, as a result of the Engle Progeny Cases as described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period. The principal factors are as follows: the number and types of cases filed and appealed; the number of cases tried and appealed; the development of the law; the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel; and litigation strategy and tactics. Please read Note 19 Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76 for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations We are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense. In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The discount rate was determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation, discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date, and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation. 27 Table of Contents The salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook. Long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, asset allocations and managements expectation of the future economic environment. Our major assumptions are set forth in Note 13 to our Consolidated Audited Financial Statements beginning on page 56. For 2010, hypothetical changes in the assumptions we used for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense: A decrease of 25 basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; and An increase of 25 basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately $1 million. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740 prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis, or market. The inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although, due to the duration of the aging processes, a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Recently adopted accounting pronouncements in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 47. Business Environment Participants in the U.S. tobacco industry, including us, face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so, including: A substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars, as well as equitable and injunctive relief, arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes, addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights, as well as other alleged damages. Substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity, and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of certain settlement agreements, including the Master Settlement Agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions (the MSA) that we entered into in 1998 along with Philip 28 Table of Contents Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the other Original Participating Manufacturers) to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, the State Settlement Agreements). The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes. The domestic cigarette market, in which we currently conduct our only significant business, continues to contract. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising, promotions and smoking in public and private facilities, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors, domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately 3.5% from 2000 through 2010. Increases in cigarette prices since 1998 have led to an increase in the volume of discount and, specifically, deep discount cigarettes. Cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in federal, state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases. Price increases have led, and continue to lead, to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands. Deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share in 1998 of less than 2.0% to an estimated 14.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic market. We do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking, but it is likely that increased prices may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so. The tobacco industry is subject to substantial and increasing regulation. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granting the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. Pursuant to the terms of the FSPTCA, the FDA could promulgate regulations that could, among other things, result in a ban on or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes. The law imposes and will impose new restrictions on the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, require larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging, permit restriction of the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured. In August 2009, we, along with RJR Tobacco, other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the FDA challenging the constitutionality of certain restrictions on speech included in the FSPTCA. These restrictions on speech include, among others, bans on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising, limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products, a prohibition on making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products, restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising, a ban on certain promotions offering gifts in consideration for the purchase of tobacco products, a ban on brand name sponsorship of events and the sale of brand name merchandise, and a ban on the distribution of product samples. The suit also challenges the laws requirement for extensive graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising. The complaint seeks a judgment (i) declaring that such provisions of the law violate the First and or Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and (ii) enjoining the FDA from enforcing the unconstitutional provisions of the law. On January 4, 2010, the district court issued an order (a) striking down the provisions of the law that banned the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising and prohibited tobacco manufacturers from making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products and (b) upholding the remaining challenged advertising provisions. Both sides have appealed the district courts ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the appeal has been fully briefed. While we believe there is established legal precedent supporting our claims we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeal. Nor can we make any assurances that any such appeal will be successful. 29 Table of Contents The federal government and many state and local governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict or discourage smoking, including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars, on airline flights and in the workplace. Other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by federal, state and local governments in the future. Substantial federal, state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes. As of April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax was $1.0066 per pack and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, excise tax increases ranging from $0.40 to $1.60 per pack were implemented in six states and the District of Columbia. Congress enacted and the President signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes by $0.6166 per pack to $1.0066 per pack, effective April 1, 2009, to finance health insurance for children. It is likely that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the most recent increase and future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including us, and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. In addition, we and other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers. The domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is primarily based on a brands taste; quality; price, including the level of discounting and other promotional activities; positioning; consumer loyalty; and retail display. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco. We also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes, including deep discount cigarette manufacturers. We believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands. As a result, in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs, which may constrain sales.

(MSAI), an independent third party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers. MSAI divides the 30 Table of Contents cigarette market into two price segments, the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment. MSAIs information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates derived by MSAI. Management believes that volume and market share information for deep discount manufacturers may be understated and, correspondingly, market share information for the larger manufacturers, including Lorillard, may be overstated by MSAI. Lorillard has made certain adjustments to the data received from MSAI to reflect managements judgment as to which brands are included in the menthol segment. (2) Source: Lorillard shipment reports. Income Statement Captions Net sales includes revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, and is recognized at the time that ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis, and are included in both net sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Cost of sales includes federal excise taxes, leaf tobacco cost, wrapping and casing material, manufacturing labor and production salaries, wages and overhead, depreciation related to manufacturing plant and equipment, research and development costs, distribution, other manufacturing costs, State Settlement Agreement expenses, the federal assessment for tobacco growers and promotional product expenses. Promotional product expenses include the cost, including all applicable excise taxes, of the free portion of buy some get some free promotions. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes sales force expenses, legal and other costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, administrative expenses and advertising and marketing costs. Advertising and marketing costs include items such as direct mail, advertising, agency fees and point of sale materials. Investment income includes interest and dividend income, realized gains and losses on sale of investments and equity in the earnings of limited partnership investments. Interest expense includes interest expense related to debt and income taxes. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2009 2010 2009 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,879 and $1,547) $ 5,932 $ 5,233 Cost of sales 3,809 3,327 Gross profit 2,123 1,906 Selling, general and administrative 398 365 Operating income 1,725 1,541 Investment income 4 5 Interest expense (94 ) (27 ) Income before income taxes 1,635 1,519 Income taxes 606 571 Net income $ 1,029 $ 948 Net sales. Net sales increased by $699 million, or 13.4%, from $5.233 billion in 2009 to $5.932 billion in 2010. Net sales increased $287 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009, 31 Table of Contents $287 million due to higher unit sales volume and $80 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in February and March 2009 and February, May and November 2010 and $45 million of lower sales incentives in 2010. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume increased 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Total Newport unit volume increased 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 31.5% in 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding the launch of Newport Non Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010, Newports domestic wholesale unit shipments increased 1.2% during the current year. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 3.8% during 2010 compared to 2009. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.2% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2010 compared to 70.5% during 2009. Our total domestic wholesale market share, based on wholesale shipments, increased by 1.0 share point during 2010 to 12.3% from 11.3% in 2009. Total Newport domestic wholesale market share increased by 0.7 share points during 2010 to 10.5% from 9.8% in 2009. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $482 million, or 14.5%, from $3.327 billion in 2009 to $3.809 billion in 2010. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($287 million), higher unit sales volume ($67 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($7 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($84 million), higher Food and Drug Administration fees ($26 million) and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers ($11 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.212 billion and $1.128 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of $84 million. The $84 million increase is due to the impact of higher unit sales ($54), the impact of the inflation adjustment ($32 million), partially offset by other adjustments ($2 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 9.0%, from $365 million in 2009 to $398 million in 2010 as a result of higher legal and compensation costs incurred in the current year. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $67 million in 2010, compared to 2009, and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2010. Income taxes. Income taxes increased $35 million or 6.1%, from $571 million in 2009 to $606 million in 2010. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $116 million in 2010 or 7.6%, offset partially by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 37.6% to 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The decrease was driven by a statutory increase in the manufacturers deduction, offset partially by the unfavorable impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted during the first quarter of 2010. 32 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,547 and $712) $ 5,233 $ 4,204 Cost of sales 3,327 2,434 Gross profit 1,906 1,770 Selling, general and administrative 365 355 Operating income 1,541 1,415 Investment income 5 20 Interest expense (27 ) (1 ) Income before income taxes 1,519 1,434 Income taxes 571 547 Net income $ 948 $ 887 Net sales. Net sales increased by $1.029 billion, or 24.5%, from $4.204 billion in 2008 to $5.233 billion in 2009. Net sales increased $835 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009 and $533 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in May and December 2008 and February and March 2009, partially offset by $251 million due to lower unit sales volume and $88 million of higher sales incentives. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume decreased 3.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Our domestic wholesale shipments in 2009 reflect the negative impact of the federal excise tax increase implemented on April 1, 2009. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Newport unit volume decreased 6.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 8.6% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.5% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2009 compared to 72.7% during 2008. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $893 million, or 36.7%, from $2.434 billion in 2008 to $3.327 billion in 2009. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($835 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($74 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($11 million), the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees ($9 million) and higher pension expense ($15 million), partially offset by lower unit sales volume ($34 million) and the absence of free product promotions ($17 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.128 billion and $1.117 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of $11 million. The $11 million increase is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment ($30 million) and other adjustments ($24 million), partially offset by lower unit sales ($43 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10 million, or 2.8%, from $355 million in 2008 to $365 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses of $18 million due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle Progeny Cases and higher pension expense of $8 million, partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs of $6 million and the absence of an $18 million charge in 2008 related to the Separation. Investment income. Investment income decreased $15 million in 2009, compared to 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $26 million in 2009, compared to 2008, and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements. 33 Table of Contents Income taxes. Income taxes increased $24 million or 4.4% from $547 million in 2008 to $571 million in 2009. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $85 million in 2009 or 5.9% partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 38.2% in 2008 to 37.6% in 2009. This decrease in the effective tax rate impacts income tax expense by $9 million, and is primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the Separation on the availability of the manufacturers deduction for the pre Separation period and the non deductibility of certain Separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents of $2.063 billion at December 31, 2010 were invested in prime money market funds. Cash Flows Cash flow from operating activities. The principal source of liquidity for our business and operating needs is internally generated funds from our operations. We generated net cash flow from operations of $1.091 billion for 2010 compared to $1.037 million for 2009. The increased cash flow in 2010 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Net cash flow from operations was $1.037 million for 2009, compared to $980 million for 2008. The increased cash flow in 2009 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Cash flow from investing activities. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $40 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to $51 million for 2009. The decrease in cash flow used by investing activities in 2010 is due to decreased purchases of equipment. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $51 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to $201 million of cash provided in 2008. The decrease in cash flow provided by investing activities in 2009 is primarily due to no investment purchases and sales. Capital expenditures were $40 million, $51 million and $44 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expenditures were primarily for the modernization of manufacturing equipment. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecast to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash flow from financing activities. Our cash flow from operations has exceeded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. We paid cash dividends to Loews of $291 million and $200 million on January 24, 2008 and April 28, 2008, respectively. We paid cash dividends to shareholders of $158 million and $155 million on September 12, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively. In 2009, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $155 million, $163 million and $158 million on March 12, 2009, June 12, 2009, September 11, 2009 and December 11, 2009, respectively. In 2010, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $152 million, $171 million and $167 million on March 11, 2010, June 11, 2010, September 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, respectively. In April 2010, Lorillard Tobacco issued $1 billion of unsecured senior notes in two tranches pursuant to an Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated April 12, 2010 (the Second Supplemental Indenture). The first tranche was $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Notes due May 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes), and the second tranche was $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Notes due May 1, 2040 (the 2040 Notes). Lorillard Tobacco is the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company and the 2020 Notes and 2040 Notes (the Notes) are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. The net proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repurchase, redemption or retirement of securities including the Companys common stock, acquisitions, additions to working capital and capital expenditures. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, Lorillard Tobacco will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event occurs when there is both a change of control (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) and the Notes cease to be rated investment grade by both Moodys and SP within 60 days of the occurrence of a change of control or public announcement of the 34 Table of Contents intention to effect a change of control. The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity. The Notes contain covenants that restrict liens and sale and leaseback transactions, subject to a limited exception. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 9.0 million shares at a cost of $79.74 per share and totaling $716 million under the $1 billion repurchase program announced on August 20, 2010, the $250 million repurchase program announced February 25, 2010 and the $750 million repurchase program announced July 27, 2009. As of February 11, 2011, the maximum dollar value of shares that could yet be purchased under the $1 billion program was $444 million. Purchases by the Company under these programs were made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by the Companys management. The purchases were funded from existing cash balances, including proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock. The timing, frequency and amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for investment in the Companys business, current stock price, market conditions and other factors. Liquidity We believe that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable us to meet our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We cannot predict our cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, and can make no assurance that we will be able to meet all of those requirements. The rate of return on our pension assets in 2010 was a positive 11.9%. Our pension expense was approximately $17 million in 2010 and we anticipate pension expense of approximately $13 million in 2011. We contributed $19 million to our pension plans in 2010 and anticipate a contribution of $15 million in 2011. We believe that it is appropriate for a company of our size and financial characteristics to have a prudent level of debt as a component of our capital structure in order to reduce our total cost of capital and improve total shareholder returns. Accordingly, we raised $1 billion and $750 million of debt financing in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect that we will seek to raise additional debt financing in the future, although the structure, timing and amount of such indebtedness has not yet been determined and will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to the prevailing credit and interest rate environment, our cash requirements, and other business, financial and tax considerations. The proceeds of any such debt financing may be used to fund stock repurchases, acquisitions, dividends or for other general corporate purposes. We presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding any debt financing transactions and no assurance can be given that we will ultimately pursue any debt financing or, if pursued, that we will be able to obtain debt financing at the suggested levels or on attractive terms. In March 2010, Lorillard Tobacco, the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $185 million revolving credit facility (Revolver) that expires March 26, 2013 and is guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds from the Revolver may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The interest rates on borrowings under the Revolver will be based on prevailing interest rates and, in part, upon the credit rating applicable to the Companys senior unsecured long term debt. The Revolver requires that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to net income plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, any extraordinary losses, any non cash expenses or losses and any losses on sales of assets outside of the ordinary course of business (EBITDA) of not more than 2.25 to 1 and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. In addition, the Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and sale and leaseback transactions subject to a limited exception. The Revolver contains customary events of default, including upon a change in control that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding, if any, under the Revolver. 35 Table of Contents There were no borrowings under the Revolver during 2010. State Settlement Agreements The State Settlement Agreements require us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers (Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company) to make aggregate annual payments of $10.4 billion in perpetuity, subject to adjustment for several factors described below. In addition, the Original Participating Manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees, subject to an aggregate annual cap of $500 million. These payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the Original Participating Manufacturers. Our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years. Both the aggregate payment obligations of the Original Participating Manufacturers, and our payment obligations, individually, under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include: inflation; aggregate volume of Original Participating Manufacturers cigarette shipments; other Original Participating Manufacturers and our market share; and aggregate Original Participating Manufacturers operating income, allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases. The inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of 3.0% or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year. The inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for 1999. The volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the Original Participating Manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the 1997 base year shipments. If volume has increased, the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997 base number. If volume has decreased, the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by 98.0% of the percentage reduction in volume. In addition, downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may, subject to specified conditions and exceptions, be reduced in the event of an increase in the Original Participating Manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the State Settlement Agreements, adjusted for inflation. Any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those Original Participating Manufacturers who have had increases. During 2010, we paid $1.134 billion under the State Settlement Agreements, primarily based on 2009 volume. Included in the above number was $92 million we deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of a claim by us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers. Most of the states that are parties to the MSA are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings. Our $92 million reduction is based upon the Original Participating Manufacturers collective loss of market share in 2006. In April of 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had previously deposited $69 million, $72 million, $111 million and $109 million, respectively, in the same escrow account discussed above, which was based on a loss of market share in 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 to non participating manufacturers. In February 2009, we directed the transfer of $72 million from this account to the non disputed account, related to the loss of market share in 2005, pursuant to an Agreement Concerning Arbitration that we and other Participating Manufacturers entered into with certain MSA states. This amount was then paid to the MSA states. We and other Original Participating Manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of MSA payments in subsequent years under provisions of the MSA. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Payment Obligations The following table presents the contractual cash payment obligations of Lorillard as of December 31, 2010: More Less Than Than 5 Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years (In millions) Senior notes $ 1,750 $ $ $ $ 1,750 Interest payments related to notes 1,590 133 398 266 793 Contractual purchase obligations 55 55 Operating lease obligations 3 2 1 Total $ 3,398 $ 190 $ 399 $ 266 $ 2,543 In addition to the obligations presented in the table above, as of December 31, 2010, we believe that it is reasonably possible that payments of up to $0.6 million may be made to various tax authorities in the next twelve months related to gross unrecognized tax benefits. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months. As previously discussed, we have entered into the State Settlement Agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers. Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments, including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys, are based on a number of factors which are described above. Our cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2010 amounted to $1.134 billion and we estimate our cash payments in 2011 under the State Settlement Agreements will be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, primarily based on 2010 estimated industry volume. Payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table. Please see the discussion of the calculation of the Original Participating Manufacturers base payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements under State Settlement Agreements on page 36. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We invest in financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented below for each class of financial instrument we held at December 31, 2010, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. The market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate risk. Our investments, which are included in cash and cash equivalents, consist of money market funds with financial institutions. Those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our average 2010 investments, would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately $21 million. Our debt is denominated in US Dollars and has been issued at a fixed rate. In September 2009, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $750 million to hedge changes in fair value of the Notes due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings along with offsetting adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged debt. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% change in LIBOR, would cause an increase or decrease in pretax income of approximately $8 million for 2010. Liquidity risk. We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expiration date if our debt rating is downgraded below Ba2 by Moodys or BB by SP. This could have a negative impact on our cash position. Early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the debt. Our current Moodys debt rating is Baa2, and our current SP debt rating is BBB , both of which are above the ratings at which settlement of our derivative contracts would be required. See Note 10 for additional information on derivatives. 38 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes related to those financial statements and Item 6. Selected Financial Data appearing herein. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the Forward Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Business Environment and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include: (1) accruals for tobacco settlement costs, legal expenses and litigation costs, sales incentive programs, income taxes and share based compensation, (2) the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and (3) the valuation of pension assets. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on managements judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Tobacco Settlement Costs In 1998, we and the other Original Participating Manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (which are referred to as the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, are referred to as the State Settlement Agreements). Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments, with respect to the MSA, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due, and, with respect to the Initial State Settlements, in the year in which payment is due. We record our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped. Please read State Settlement Agreements beginning on page 36 for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Tobacco and Other Litigation We and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages, return of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages. We believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us. We also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us. While we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. We may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Except for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements and the provision relating to the Scott case, as described in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76, our management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation. Defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling, general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred. Defense costs may increase in future periods, in part, as a result of the Engle Progeny Cases as described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period. The principal factors are as follows: the number and types of cases filed and appealed; the number of cases tried and appealed; the development of the law; the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel; and litigation strategy and tactics. Please read Note 19 Legal Proceedings, to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page 76 for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations We are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense. In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The discount rate was determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation, discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date, and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation. 27 Table of Contents The salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook. Long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, asset allocations and managements expectation of the future economic environment. Our major assumptions are set forth in Note 13 to our Consolidated Audited Financial Statements beginning on page 56. For 2010, hypothetical changes in the assumptions we used for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense: A decrease of 25 basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately $2 million; and An increase of 25 basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately $1 million. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740 prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis, or market. The inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although, due to the duration of the aging processes, a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Recently adopted accounting pronouncements in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 47. Business Environment Participants in the U.S. tobacco industry, including us, face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so, including: A substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars, as well as equitable and injunctive relief, arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes, addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights, as well as other alleged damages. Substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity, and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of certain settlement agreements, including the Master Settlement Agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions (the MSA) that we entered into in 1998 along with Philip 28 Table of Contents Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the other Original Participating Manufacturers) to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. We and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (the Initial State Settlements, and together with the MSA, the State Settlement Agreements). The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes. The domestic cigarette market, in which we currently conduct our only significant business, continues to contract. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising, promotions and smoking in public and private facilities, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors, domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately 3.5% from 2000 through 2010. Increases in cigarette prices since 1998 have led to an increase in the volume of discount and, specifically, deep discount cigarettes. Cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in federal, state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases. Price increases have led, and continue to lead, to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands. Deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share in 1998 of less than 2.0% to an estimated 14.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic market. We do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking, but it is likely that increased prices may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so. The tobacco industry is subject to substantial and increasing regulation. In June 2009, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granting the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. Pursuant to the terms of the FSPTCA, the FDA could promulgate regulations that could, among other things, result in a ban on or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes. The law imposes and will impose new restrictions on the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, require larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging, permit restriction of the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured. In August 2009, we, along with RJR Tobacco, other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the FDA challenging the constitutionality of certain restrictions on speech included in the FSPTCA. These restrictions on speech include, among others, bans on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising, limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products, a prohibition on making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products, restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising, a ban on certain promotions offering gifts in consideration for the purchase of tobacco products, a ban on brand name sponsorship of events and the sale of brand name merchandise, and a ban on the distribution of product samples. The suit also challenges the laws requirement for extensive graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising. The complaint seeks a judgment (i) declaring that such provisions of the law violate the First and or Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and (ii) enjoining the FDA from enforcing the unconstitutional provisions of the law. On January 4, 2010, the district court issued an order (a) striking down the provisions of the law that banned the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising and prohibited tobacco manufacturers from making certain statements about the FDAs regulation of tobacco products and (b) upholding the remaining challenged advertising provisions. Both sides have appealed the district courts ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the appeal has been fully briefed. While we believe there is established legal precedent supporting our claims we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeal. Nor can we make any assurances that any such appeal will be successful. 29 Table of Contents The federal government and many state and local governments and agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict or discourage smoking, including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars, on airline flights and in the workplace. Other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by federal, state and local governments in the future. Substantial federal, state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes. As of April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax was $1.0066 per pack and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.17 to $5.85 per pack. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, excise tax increases ranging from $0.40 to $1.60 per pack were implemented in six states and the District of Columbia. Congress enacted and the President signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes by $0.6166 per pack to $1.0066 per pack, effective April 1, 2009, to finance health insurance for children. It is likely that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the most recent increase and future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including us, and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands. In addition, we and other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers. The domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is primarily based on a brands taste; quality; price, including the level of discounting and other promotional activities; positioning; consumer loyalty; and retail display. Our principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco. We also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes, including deep discount cigarette manufacturers. We believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by Philip Morris and RJR Tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands. As a result, in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs, which may constrain sales.

(MSAI), an independent third party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers. MSAI divides the 30 Table of Contents cigarette market into two price segments, the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment. MSAIs information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates derived by MSAI. Management believes that volume and market share information for deep discount manufacturers may be understated and, correspondingly, market share information for the larger manufacturers, including Lorillard, may be overstated by MSAI. Lorillard has made certain adjustments to the data received from MSAI to reflect managements judgment as to which brands are included in the menthol segment. (2) Source: Lorillard shipment reports. Income Statement Captions Net sales includes revenue from product sales, net of sales incentives, and is recognized at the time that ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis, and are included in both net sales and cost of sales. Sales incentives include retail price discounts, coupons and retail display allowances, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates. Cost of sales includes federal excise taxes, leaf tobacco cost, wrapping and casing material, manufacturing labor and production salaries, wages and overhead, depreciation related to manufacturing plant and equipment, research and development costs, distribution, other manufacturing costs, State Settlement Agreement expenses, the federal assessment for tobacco growers and promotional product expenses. Promotional product expenses include the cost, including all applicable excise taxes, of the free portion of buy some get some free promotions. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes sales force expenses, legal and other costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, administrative expenses and advertising and marketing costs.

Interest expense includes interest expense related to debt and income taxes. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2009 2010 2009 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,879 and $1,547) $ 5,932 $ 5,233 Cost of sales 3,809 3,327 Gross profit 2,123 1,906 Selling, general and administrative 398 365 Operating income 1,725 1,541 Investment income 4 5 Interest expense (94 ) (27 ) Income before income taxes 1,635 1,519 Income taxes 606 571 Net income $ 1,029 $ 948 Net sales. Net sales increased by $699 million, or 13.4%, from $5.233 billion in 2009 to $5.932 billion in 2010. Net sales increased $287 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009, 31 Table of Contents $287 million due to higher unit sales volume and $80 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in February and March 2009 and February, May and November 2010 and $45 million of lower sales incentives in 2010. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume increased 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Total Newport unit volume increased 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009. Mavericks domestic wholesale shipments increased 31.5% in 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding the launch of Newport Non Menthol in the fourth quarter of 2010, Newports domestic wholesale unit shipments increased 1.2% during the current year. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 3.8% during 2010 compared to 2009. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.2% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2010 compared to 70.5% during 2009. Our total domestic wholesale market share, based on wholesale shipments, increased by 1.0 share point during 2010 to 12.3% from 11.3% in 2009. Total Newport domestic wholesale market share increased by 0.7 share points during 2010 to 10.5% from 9.8% in 2009. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $482 million, or 14.5%, from $3.327 billion in 2009 to $3.809 billion in 2010. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($287 million), higher unit sales volume ($67 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($7 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($84 million), higher Food and Drug Administration fees ($26 million) and the Federal Assessment for Tobacco Growers ($11 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.212 billion and $1.128 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of $84 million. The $84 million increase is due to the impact of higher unit sales ($54), the impact of the inflation adjustment ($32 million), partially offset by other adjustments ($2 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 9.0%, from $365 million in 2009 to $398 million in 2010 as a result of higher legal and compensation costs incurred in the current year. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $67 million in 2010, compared to 2009, and reflects interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements, and interest on the senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2010. Income taxes. Income taxes increased $35 million or 6.1%, from $571 million in 2009 to $606 million in 2010. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $116 million in 2010 or 7.6%, offset partially by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 37.6% to 37.1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The decrease was driven by a statutory increase in the manufacturers deduction, offset partially by the unfavorable impact of the repeal of future tax deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies for retiree drug benefits pursuant to the health care reform legislation enacted during the first quarter of 2010. 32 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2008 2009 2008 (In millions) Net sales (including excise taxes of $1,547 and $712) $ 5,233 $ 4,204 Cost of sales 3,327 2,434 Gross profit 1,906 1,770 Selling, general and administrative 365 355 Operating income 1,541 1,415 Investment income 5 20 Interest expense (27 ) (1 ) Income before income taxes 1,519 1,434 Income taxes 571 547 Net income $ 948 $ 887 Net sales. Net sales increased by $1.029 billion, or 24.5%, from $4.204 billion in 2008 to $5.233 billion in 2009. Net sales increased $835 million due to the increase in federal excise taxes effective April 1, 2009 and $533 million due to higher average unit prices reflecting price increases in May and December 2008 and February and March 2009, partially offset by $251 million due to lower unit sales volume and $88 million of higher sales incentives. Federal excise taxes are included in net sales and increased $30.83 per thousand units, or $0.62 per pack of 20 units, to $50.33 per thousand cigarettes, or $1.01 per pack of 20 cigarettes, effective April 1, 2009. Our total unit volume and domestic unit volume decreased 3.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Unit volume figures in this section are provided on a gross basis. Our domestic wholesale shipments in 2009 reflect the negative impact of the federal excise tax increase implemented on April 1, 2009. Total Newport unit volume and domestic Newport unit volume decreased 6.9% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry wide domestic unit volume decreased an estimated 8.6% during 2009 compared to 2008. Industry shipments of premium brands comprised 70.5% of industry wide domestic unit volume during 2009 compared to 72.7% during 2008. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by $893 million, or 36.7%, from $2.434 billion in 2008 to $3.327 billion in 2009. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the increase in federal excise taxes ($835 million), higher raw material costs, primarily tobacco and wrapping materials ($74 million), higher expenses related to the State Settlement Agreements ($11 million), the assessment of Food and Drug Administration fees ($9 million) and higher pension expense ($15 million), partially offset by lower unit sales volume ($34 million) and the absence of free product promotions ($17 million). We recorded pre tax charges for our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements of $1.128 billion and $1.117 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of $11 million. The $11 million increase is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment ($30 million) and other adjustments ($24 million), partially offset by lower unit sales ($43 million). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10 million, or 2.8%, from $355 million in 2008 to $365 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses of $18 million due to the continuing defense costs associated with the Engle Progeny Cases and higher pension expense of $8 million, partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs of $6 million and the absence of an $18 million charge in 2008 related to the Separation. Investment income. Investment income decreased $15 million in 2009, compared to 2008 and the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates on investments. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $26 million in 2009, compared to 2008, and the increase reflects interest on the Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of 2009, net of the effect of interest rate swap agreements. 33 Table of Contents Income taxes. Income taxes increased $24 million or 4.4% from $547 million in 2008 to $571 million in 2009. The change reflects the increase in income before income taxes of $85 million in 2009 or 5.9% partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 38.2% in 2008 to 37.6% in 2009. This decrease in the effective tax rate impacts income tax expense by $9 million, and is primarily due to the impact, in 2008, of the Separation on the availability of the manufacturers deduction for the pre Separation period and the non deductibility of certain Separation expenses, and, in 2009, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, partially offset by an increase in state tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents of $2.063 billion at December 31, 2010 were invested in prime money market funds. Cash Flows Cash flow from operating activities. The principal source of liquidity for our business and operating needs is internally generated funds from our operations. We generated net cash flow from operations of $1.091 billion for 2010 compared to $1.037 million for 2009. The increased cash flow in 2010 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Net cash flow from operations was $1.037 million for 2009, compared to $980 million for 2008. The increased cash flow in 2009 primarily reflects the increase in net income. Cash flow from investing activities. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $40 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to $51 million for 2009. The decrease in cash flow used by investing activities in 2010 is due to decreased purchases of equipment. Our cash flow from investing activities used cash of $51 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 compared to $201 million of cash provided in 2008. The decrease in cash flow provided by investing activities in 2009 is primarily due to no investment purchases and sales. Capital expenditures were $40 million, $51 million and $44 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expenditures were primarily for the modernization of manufacturing equipment. Our capital expenditures for 2011 are forecast to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash flow from financing activities. Our cash flow from operations has exceeded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. We paid cash dividends to Loews of $291 million and $200 million on January 24, 2008 and April 28, 2008, respectively. We paid cash dividends to shareholders of $158 million and $155 million on September 12, 2008 and December 12, 2008, respectively. In 2009, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $155 million, $163 million and $158 million on March 12, 2009, June 12, 2009, September 11, 2009 and December 11, 2009, respectively. In 2010, we paid cash dividends of $155 million, $152 million, $171 million and $167 million on March 11, 2010, June 11, 2010, September 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, respectively. In April 2010, Lorillard Tobacco issued $1 billion of unsecured senior notes in two tranches pursuant to an Indenture, dated June 23, 2009, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated April 12, 2010 (the Second Supplemental Indenture). The first tranche was $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Notes due May 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes), and the second tranche was $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Notes due May 1, 2040 (the 2040 Notes). Lorillard Tobacco is the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company and the 2020 Notes and 2040 Notes (the Notes) are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. The net proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repurchase, redemption or retirement of securities including the Companys common stock, acquisitions, additions to working capital and capital expenditures. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, Lorillard Tobacco will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event occurs when there is both a change of control (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) and the Notes cease to be rated investment grade by both Moodys and SP within 60 days of the occurrence of a change of control or public announcement of the 34 Table of Contents intention to effect a change of control. The Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity. The Notes contain covenants that restrict liens and sale and leaseback transactions, subject to a limited exception. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 9.0 million shares at a cost of $79.74 per share and totaling $716 million under the $1 billion repurchase program announced on August 20, 2010, the $250 million repurchase program announced February 25, 2010 and the $750 million repurchase program announced July 27, 2009. As of February 11, 2011, the maximum dollar value of shares that could yet be purchased under the $1 billion program was $444 million. Purchases by the Company under these programs were made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques or otherwise, as determined by the Companys management. The purchases were funded from existing cash balances, including proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock. The timing, frequency and amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for investment in the Companys business, current stock price, market conditions and other factors. Liquidity We believe that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable us to meet our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We cannot predict our cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, and can make no assurance that we will be able to meet all of those requirements. The rate of return on our pension assets in 2010 was a positive 11.9%. Our pension expense was approximately $17 million in 2010 and we anticipate pension expense of approximately $13 million in 2011. We contributed $19 million to our pension plans in 2010 and anticipate a contribution of $15 million in 2011. We believe that it is appropriate for a company of our size and financial characteristics to have a prudent level of debt as a component of our capital structure in order to reduce our total cost of capital and improve total shareholder returns. Accordingly, we raised $1 billion and $750 million of debt financing in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect that we will seek to raise additional debt financing in the future, although the structure, timing and amount of such indebtedness has not yet been determined and will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to the prevailing credit and interest rate environment, our cash requirements, and other business, financial and tax considerations. The proceeds of any such debt financing may be used to fund stock repurchases, acquisitions, dividends or for other general corporate purposes. We presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding any debt financing transactions and no assurance can be given that we will ultimately pursue any debt financing or, if pursued, that we will be able to obtain debt financing at the suggested levels or on attractive terms. In March 2010, Lorillard Tobacco, the principal, wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $185 million revolving credit facility (Revolver) that expires March 26, 2013 and is guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds from the Revolver may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The interest rates on borrowings under the Revolver will be based on prevailing interest rates and, in part, upon the credit rating applicable to the Companys senior unsecured long term debt. The Revolver requires that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to net income plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, any extraordinary losses, any non cash expenses or losses and any losses on sales of assets outside of the ordinary course of business (EBITDA) of not more than 2.25 to 1 and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. In addition, the Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and sale and leaseback transactions subject to a limited exception. The Revolver contains customary events of default, including upon a change in control that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding, if any, under the Revolver. 35 Table of Contents There were no borrowings under the Revolver during 2010. State Settlement Agreements The State Settlement Agreements require us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers (Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company) to make aggregate annual payments of $10.4 billion in perpetuity, subject to adjustment for several factors described below. In addition, the Original Participating Manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees, subject to an aggregate annual cap of $500 million. These payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the Original Participating Manufacturers. Our obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years. Both the aggregate payment obligations of the Original Participating Manufacturers, and our payment obligations, individually, under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include: inflation; aggregate volume of Original Participating Manufacturers cigarette shipments; other Original Participating Manufacturers and our market share; and aggregate Original Participating Manufacturers operating income, allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases. The inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of 3.0% or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year. The inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for 1999. The volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the Original Participating Manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the 1997 base year shipments. If volume has increased, the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997 base number. If volume has decreased, the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by 98.0% of the percentage reduction in volume. In addition, downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may, subject to specified conditions and exceptions, be reduced in the event of an increase in the Original Participating Manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the State Settlement Agreements, adjusted for inflation. Any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those Original Participating Manufacturers who have had increases. During 2010, we paid $1.134 billion under the State Settlement Agreements, primarily based on 2009 volume. Included in the above number was $92 million we deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of a claim by us and the other Original Participating Manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers. Most of the states that are parties to the MSA are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings. Our $92 million reduction is based upon the Original Participating Manufacturers collective loss of market share in 2006. In April of 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had previously deposited $69 million, $72 million, $111 million and $109 million, respectively, in the same escrow account discussed above, which was based on a loss of market share in 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 to non participating manufacturers. In February 2009, we directed the transfer of $72 million from this account to the non disputed account, related to the loss of market share in 2005, pursuant to an Agreement Concerning Arbitration that we and other Participating Manufacturers entered into with certain MSA states. This amount was then paid to the MSA states. We and other Original Participating Manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of MSA payments in subsequent years under provisions of the MSA. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Payment Obligations The following table presents the contractual cash payment obligations of Lorillard as of December 31, 2010: More Less Than Than 5 Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years (In millions) Senior notes $ 1,750 $ $ $ $ 1,750 Interest payments related to notes 1,590 133 398 266 793 Contractual purchase obligations 55 55 Operating lease obligations 3 2 1 Total $ 3,398 $ 190 $ 399 $ 266 $ 2,543 In addition to the obligations presented in the table above, as of December 31, 2010, we believe that it is reasonably possible that payments of up to $0.6 million may be made to various tax authorities in the next twelve months related to gross unrecognized tax benefits. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months. As previously discussed, we have entered into the State Settlement Agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers. Our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments, including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys, are based on a number of factors which are described above. Our cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2010 amounted to $1.134 billion and we estimate our cash payments in 2011 under the State Settlement Agreements will be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, primarily based on 2010 estimated industry volume. Payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table. Please see the discussion of the calculation of the Original Participating Manufacturers base payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements under State Settlement Agreements on page 36. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We invest in financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Market risk exposure is presented below for each class of financial instrument we held at December 31, 2010, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. The market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. Interest rate risk. Our investments, which are included in cash and cash equivalents, consist of money market funds with financial institutions. Those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our average 2010 investments, would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately $21 million. Our debt is denominated in US Dollars and has been issued at a fixed rate. In September 2009, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $750 million to hedge changes in fair value of the Notes due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings along with offsetting adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged debt. A sensitivity analysis, based on a hypothetical 1% change in LIBOR, would cause an increase or decrease in pretax income of approximately $8 million for 2010. Liquidity risk. We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expiration date if our debt rating is downgraded below Ba2 by Moodys or BB by SP. This could have a negative impact on our cash position. Early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the debt. Our current Moodys debt rating is Baa2, and our current SP debt rating is BBB , both of which are above the ratings at which settlement of our derivative contracts would be required. See Note 10 for additional information on derivatives. 38 Table of Contents
