Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three year period ended February 3, 2006 (our fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003). Fiscal year 2005 contains 53 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal years 2004 and 2003 which contain 52 weeks. Unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 represent the fiscal years ended February 3, 2006, January 28, 2005 and January 30, 2004, respectively. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reviewed our method of accounting for early payment discounts on merchandise purchases and determined we should recognize these discounts initially as a reduction of inventory cost and then as a reduction to cost of sales in the period when the related inventory is sold. We previously recognized early payment discounts as a financing component of merchandise purchases by reducing cost of sales when the related product was purchased. Prior period financial statements have been restated for the timing of recognition of early payment discounts. Information presented for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 in the accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis reflects such restatement. The Board of Directors approved a 2 for 1 stock split of our common shares on May 25, 2006. The stock split was effective June 30, 2006 to shareholders of record on June 16, 2006. All prior period common share and per common share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 2 for 1 stock split. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we sold 26 commodity focused locations operating under The Contractor Yard name (the Contractor Yards). This sale was effected to allow us to continue to focus on our retail and commercial business. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we have reported the results of operations of the Contractor Yards in discontinued operations for fiscal year 2003. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our vision is to be our customers first choice for home improvement in each and every market we serve. This focus on the customer drives our operational, merchandising, marketing and distribution initiatives and helps fuel growth in our existing stores. We are also focused on expanding our share of the home improvement market through geographic expansion and the expansion of our customer base, and we believe that providing excellent customer service is imperative to our future growth. Following is a summary of certain key initiatives that we believe will allow us to achieve our vision and expand our share of the home improvement market. Focusing on our customers Customer service Having the right foundation of talented and tenured employees is integral to providing excellent customer service and fueling our growth strategy. To ensure our success, we continue to implement training and development programs for our store employees to help better serve our customers. We also continue to enhance our staffing model to optimize store labor, while positioning more sales people in the aisles to take care of customers. Meeting customers specific needs We are focusing on our customers by providing the products and services they want. Over the last five years, we have moved beyond merely sourcing, stocking and selling products to consumers for their home repair and improvement needs. We have become an integrated provider of home repair and improvement solutions. We help customers plan home repair and improvement projects using automated systems to identify the products needed for the project, sell those products to the customer, and arrange for installation at the customers home. We evaluate the demographics of our markets and obtain customer feedback to identify areas where we can provide products or services to specifically meet customers needs. Our Big 3 sales initiatives are designed to meet specific needs of customers and have helped bring more customers into our stores, delivering comparable store sales results that are well above our overall company average. 9 Installed Sales As baby boomers shift to do it for me (DIFM) from do it yourself (DIY), the opportunity for continued growth in Installed Sales increases. To capitalize on the growing DIFM segment, we will continue to expand installation services such as roofing, window replacements, fencing and siding to meet customer demand. To meet the needs of the DIFM customer, we are testing and evaluating an in home sales model that is staffed with in market sales teams who have expertise in evaluating and pricing installed projects at a customers home. Our initial results are favorable and we will continue to evaluate this program during 2006. Sales of installed products and services were $2.6 billion in 2005, a 31% increase over the previous year. Special Order Sales (SOS) Customers want to express their individuality through their homes, and as a result, we continue to enhance our special order product offering. We are making the SOS process easier for customers by enhancing ordering systems storewide, providing easy to use customer interfaces, integrated design tools, and electronic product catalogs. Employees utilized our electronic catalog program to process over 70% of our Special Order Sales last year. This allows us to add more product choices and reduces paper work for our stores, which increases the accuracy of the ordering process. Special Order Sales, which have some degree of overlap with Installed Sales, were $3.9 billion in 2005, a 25% increase over the prior year. Commercial Business Customer (CBC) Over 25% of our total sales in 2005 were to Commercial Business Customers, a category including repair and remodelers, property management professionals, and a variety of professional trades people. Our concerted effort to build strong relationships with these customers and to staff our stores with well trained commercial sales specialists is leading to increasing sales of products throughout the store. In 2005, we completed the rollout of the Regional Commercial Sales Manager (RCSM) program. The RCSM teaches, trains and shares best practices throughout our stores. The RCSM also ensures consistent execution of our lead management process and delivery programs. Our commercial sales desk is staffed with trained commercial sales specialists who provide the service and knowledge that commercial customers require and continue to build strong relationships with these customers. Everyday Low Prices (EDLP) We know that providing Everyday Low Prices is important to customers. Our promise to customers is if they find a lower everyday or advertised price on an identical stock product at a local competitor, we will not only match that price, but we will beat it by 10 percent. To maintain our EDLP strategy and offer the high quality products that customers demand, our merchants are constantly working with our vendors to develop new and innovative products for our customers. We also use our Global Sourcing offices to assist us in sourcing products that offer design exclusivity and allow us to develop our own proprietary brands. This gives us an opportunity to reduce inventory costs and at the same time gives us more control over product quality. In 2005, imports grew at almost twice the rate of our total sales increase. We expect imports to continue to grow. Investing in our infrastructure In order to provide customers with a more inviting shopping experience, during 2005 we continued our history of investing in our existing stores. This includes relamping our stores at regular intervals to ensure they remain bright, adding new displays, improving point of sale and directional signage, adding more product selection, repainting building exteriors, and re striping parking lots. Additionally, our investment in bilingual signage and point of purchase materials continues to attract and retain the growing population of multicultural customers. We invested approximately $650 million in existing stores in 2005. In addition to our commitment to invest and improve our stores, we are committed to improving our supply chain infrastructure to ensure we have the right products, in the right stores, at the right time. Our Rapid Response Replenishment (R3) initiative allows us to both maintain and improve our in stock position while driving greater efficiencies and flexibility in the total supply chain infrastructure. When we began this initiative in 2004, approximately 50% of our stock product was moving through our distribution network. We now have appliances in eight regional distribution centers (RDC), along with riding mowers, lawn and garden chemicals and fashion plumbing items moving through all RDCs. Today about 70% of stock product flows through our distribution network, and we are well positioned to achieve our goal of 75% by the end of 2006. 10 Indicators of our success We monitor several metrics to measure the success of our initiatives. These metrics include comparable store sales, average ticket and customer transactions. We experienced a comparable store sales increase of 6.1% in 2005, which was on top of comparable store sales increases of 6.6% in 2004 and 6.7% in 2003. This reflects a three year average comparable store sales increase of 6.5%. The comparable store sales increase in 2005 was driven by increases in both average ticket and transactions. Average ticket for comparable stores increased approximately 6.1% in 2005, and comparable store customer transactions increased slightly. We believe our strong financial results in 2005, as evidenced by these metrics, indicate the success of our key initiatives and the progress we are making to achieve our vision. Expanding our geographic and customer base Geographic expansion We continue to pursue opportunities to expand our business into additional geographic markets, customer groups and product categories. We opened 150 stores in 2005 and ended the year with 1,234 stores in 49 states. We plan to open 155 stores in 2006, increasing total square footage by approximately 12%. Approximately 50% of these stores will be in our under penetrated Northeast and West divisions. We will balance our metro expansion with the opportunities presented in smaller markets, many of which are ideal locations for our 94,000 square foot (94K) prototype. In addition, in June of 2005, we announced future expansion into Canada, with plans to open six to 10 stores in the Greater Toronto Area in 2007. The percentage of our stores located in the nations top 25 and top 100 markets is increasing (28% and 55%, respectively, at the end of 2005). These markets are more competitive, but offer the opportunity to capture significant market share from direct competitors and other sales channels for our products and expanding service offerings. More than 35% of the 400 approved projects for our future expansion are located in the nations top 25 markets and more than 65% are located in the nations top 100 markets. We also continue to invest in our distribution network to support our growth, including opening one additional regional distribution center during 2005 in Plainfield, Connecticut. At February 3, 2006, we owned and operated 11 RDCs. We expect to open additional RDCs in Rockford, Illinois and Lebanon, Oregon in 2007. In addition, we plan to expand three existing distribution centers in Valdosta, Georgia, Statesville, North Carolina and North Vernon, Indiana by spring 2006. At February 3, 2006, we also owned and operated 10 flatbed distribution centers and leased and operated two flatbed distribution centers for the handling of lumber, building materials and other long length items. We expect to open four additional flatbed distribution centers in 2006. Customer base expansion We are pursuing additional opportunities for expansion of our customer base through multicultural marketing. While total homeownership rose to approximately 69% in 2004, Hispanic homeownership grew at three times the average rate. In addition, over the next 10 years, Harvards Joint Center for Housing estimates immigration will represent at least 40% of household formation. Therefore, during 2005, we continued to produce marketing and communications designed to reach specific cultural segments of the population, including the growing Hispanic and African American home improvement consumer segments. Our significant investment in bilingual signage and point of purchase materials continues to attract and retain the growing population of diverse customers. We also provide a translation service via telephone at the customer service desk in each of our stores, making communication easier for non English speaking customers. We are also expanding our business by growing market share in product categories previously sold exclusively or largely through other sales channels, including major appliances. According to independent measures, we increased our unit share in major appliances by 130 basis points for calendar year 2005 versus calendar year 2004. Our success in appliances is a function of our brand selection and knowledgeable sales specialists. Independent research confirms we are experiencing similar results in outdoor power equipment. In both of these categories in 2005 we expanded our line of brands to include Samsung digital kitchen appliances and John Deere mowers. 11 External factors that impact our business The home improvement market is large and fragmented. While we are the worlds second largest home improvement retailer, we have captured a relatively small portion of the overall home improvement market. We estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market to be approximately $700 billion, comprised of $550 billion of product demand and $150 billion for the installed labor opportunity. This estimate includes import and export data and key end use markets, such as residential repair and remodeling, and nonresidential construction and maintenance. This data also captures a wide range of categories relevant to our business, including major appliances and garden supplies. We believe the current home improvement market provides ample opportunity to support our growth plans. As we continue to monitor economic data and the home improvement marketplace, we believe there will be continued strength in consumer demand for the products and services we offer. The key economic indicators that we monitor include personal income, employment growth, housing turnover and homeownership levels. Demographic and societal trends also remain supportive of home improvement industry growth. Personal income continues to grow, which is supported by data from the February 2006 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which forecasts real disposable income growth of 3.4% for calendar 2006, compared with 1.4% in calendar 2005. Employment growth is also a strong indicator of home improvement sales. The relatively low unemployment rate suggests Americans will likely be more confident in calendar 2006 about employment prospects than in the past several years. Housing turnover is expected to continue at a historically high pace according to The National Association of Realtors, which forecasts calendar 2006 housing turnover to be the third strongest year on record. Near record U.S. homeownership levels provide an established customer base for home maintenance and repair projects. The vast majority of our customers are homeowners, and they are not willing to let what is often their most valuable financial asset deteriorate. Such factors contribute to our belief that the home improvement industry will continue to support the growth of our business. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Merchandise Inventory Description We record an inventory reserve for the loss associated with selling discontinued inventories below cost. This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience relating to the liquidation of discontinued inventory. During 2005, we increased our discontinued inventory reserve by $27 million to $104 million as of February 3, 2006. We also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. This reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories. During 2005, we increased our inventory shrinkage reserve by $19 million to $113 million as of February 3, 2006. 12 Judgments and Uncertainties Involved in the Estimate We do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Likewise, changes in actual shrinkage results from completed physical inventories could result in revisions to previously estimated shrinkage expense. Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Although we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% difference in our discontinued inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $6 million for 2005. A 10% difference in our estimated shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million for 2005. Vendor Funds Description We receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business for a variety of reasons, including purchase volume related discounts and rebates, advertising allowances, reimbursements for third party in store service related costs, defective merchandise allowances, reimbursements for selling expenses and display costs, and early payment discounts on merchandise purchases. When necessary, we use projected purchase volumes to estimate accrual rates, validate those projections based on actual purchase trends and apply those rates to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 16 (EITF 02 16), Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, vendor funds are treated as a reduction of inventory cost, unless they represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendors product. Substantially all of the vendor funds that we receive do not meet the specific, incremental and identifiable criteria in EITF 02 16. Therefore, for vendor fund agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, which was the effective date of the related provision of EITF 02 16, we treat funds that do not meet the specific, incremental and identifiable criteria as a reduction in the cost of inventory and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold. Prior to the adoption of EITF 02 16, cooperative advertising allowances and third party in store service funds were recorded as an offset to the related expense in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expense. Judgments and Uncertainties Involved in the Estimate Amounts accrued could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes. Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory. Changes in these estimates would have a greater effect on interim periods than our annual results, as purchase volume estimates are updated for actual purchase volumes at each year end. Self Insurance Description We are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation, automobile, property, general and product liability, and certain medical and dental claims. Self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. The self insurance liability was $571 million and $467 million at February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005, respectively. Judgments and Uncertainties Involved in the Estimate These estimates are subject to changes in the utilized discount rate, forecasted payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency and severity of claims. 13 Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Although we believe that we have the ability to adequately record estimated losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self insurance liabilities. A 10% difference in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $35 million for 2005. A 1% change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $8 million for 2005. Long Lived Assets Description Losses related to impairment of long lived assets are recognized when circumstances indicate the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. We periodically review the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment. When we commit to close or relocate a store location, or when there are indicators that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset in relation to its expected undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value, a provision is made for the impairment of the asset based on the excess of carrying value over fair value. We recorded long lived asset impairment charges of $16 million during 2005. The net carrying value for relocated stores, closed stores and other excess property totaled $63 million and $56 million at February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005, respectively. Judgments and Uncertainties Involved in the Estimate Our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating asset fair values and future cash flows, including estimated sales and earnings growth rates and assumptions about market performance. Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from estimated impairment losses. OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year. This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 14 Basis Point Increase / (Decrease) in Percentage of Net Sales from Prior Year 1 Percentage Increase / (Decrease) in Dollar Amounts from Prior Year 1 2005 2004 2005 vs. 2004 2005 vs. 2004 Net Sales 100.00 % 100.00 % N/A 19 % Gross Margin 34.20 33.56 64 21 Expenses: Selling, General and Administrative 20.84 20.74 10 19 Store Opening Costs 0.33 0.34 (1 ) 15 Depreciation 2.27 2.35 (8 ) 14 Interest 0.37 0.48 (11 ) (10 ) Total Expenses 23.81 23.91 (10 ) 18 Pre Tax Earnings 10.39 9.65 74 28 Income Tax Provision 4.00 3.71 29 28 Net Earnings 6.39 % 5.94 % 45 28 % Basis Point Increase / (Decrease) in Percentage of Net Sales from Prior Year Percentage Increase / (Decrease) in Dollar Amounts from Prior Year 2004 2003 2004 vs. 2003 2004 vs. 2003 Net Sales 100.00 % 100.00 % N/A 18 % Gross Margin 33.56 30.92 264 28 Expenses: Selling, General and Administrative 20.74 18.09 265 36 Store Opening Costs 0.34 0.42 (8 ) (4 ) Depreciation 2.35 2.40 (5 ) 16 Interest 0.48 0.58 (10 ) (2 ) Total Expenses 23.91 21.49 242 32 Pre Tax Earnings 9.65 9.43 22 21 Income Tax Provision 3.71 3.57 14 23 Earnings from Continuing Operations 5.94 5.86 8 20 Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 0.05 (5 ) (100 ) Net Earnings 5.94 % 5.91 % 3 19 % Other Metrics 2005 2004 2003 Comparable Store Sales Increases 2 6.1 % 6.6 % 6.7 % Customer Transactions (in millions) 639 575 521 Average Ticket 3 $ 67.67 $ 63.43 $ 59.21 At End of Year: Number of Stores 1,234 1,087 952 Sales Floor Square Feet (in millions) 140 124 109 Average Store Size Square Feet (in thousands) 113 114 114 Return on Beginning Assets 4 13.1 % 11.6 % 11.5 % Return on Beginning Shareholders Equity 5 24.0 % 21.3 % 22.2 % 1 The fiscal year ended February 3, 2006 had 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2005 and January 30, 2004 had 52 weeks. 2 We define a comparable store as a store that has been open longer than 13 months. A store that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation. The relocated store must then remain open greater than 13 months to be considered comparable. The comparable store sales increase for 2005 included in the preceding table was calculated using sales for a comparable 53 week period. 3 We define average ticket as net sales divided by number of customer transactions. 4 Return on beginning assets is defined as net earnings divided by beginning total assets. 5 Return on beginning shareholders equity is defined as net earnings divided by beginning shareholders equity. 15 Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 For the purpose of the following discussion, comparable store sales, comparable store average ticket and comparable store customer transactions are based on comparable 53 week periods. Net sales Comparable store sales, our ongoing store expansion and relocation program and continued growth in our three specialty sales initiatives were key drivers of our sales increase in 2005. We opened 150 stores in 2005, including three relocations, and ended the year with stores in 49 states, including our first stores in New Hampshire. The additional week in 2005 resulted in approximately $750 million in sales and impacted 2005 sales growth by about 2.1%. The comparable store sales increase of 6.1% in 2005 was on top of comparable store sales increases of 6.6% in 2004 and 6.7% in 2003. This reflects a three year average comparable store sales increase of 6.5%. The comparable store sales increase in 2005 was driven by increases in both average ticket and transactions. Average ticket for comparable stores increased 6.1% and comparable store customer transactions increased slightly. We experienced comparable store sales increases in every product category for 2005. The categories that performed above our average comparable store sales increase for 2005 included millwork, rough plumbing, building materials, rough electrical, outdoor power equipment, appliances, home environment, paint, flooring and cabinets & countertops. In addition, hardware and fashion plumbing performed at approximately the average comparable store sales increase. Inflation in lumber and building materials favorably impacted comparable store sales for 2005 by approximately 50 basis points, driven by gypsum, roofing and cement products. We also continue to gain market share in key product categories previously dominated by other channels including appliances, outdoor power equipment and cabinets & countertops. The appliance category delivered a double digit comparable store sales increase for 2005. According to independent measures, we increased our unit share in major appliances by 130 basis points for calendar year 2005 versus calendar year 2004. Our success in appliances is a function of our brand selection and knowledgeable sales specialists. The recent introduction of Samsung digital appliances is evidence of our commitment to enhance our brand selection and competitive offering. We experienced a double digit comparable store sales increase for 2005 in cabinets & countertops, which was driven by emphasis on our product offering, as well as our focus on our Installed Sales initiative, which plays a key role in driving cabinets & countertop sales. Outdoor power equipment delivered a high single digit comparable store sales increase for the year. We continue to enhance our portfolio of outdoor power equipment. The addition of John Deere is expected to increase sales in this category and provide further selection of quality products for our customers. According to independent measures, we increased our outdoor power equipment unit share by 190 basis points for calendar year 2005 versus calendar year 2004. We also experienced comparable store sales increases in 18 of the 21 geographic regions. We continue to experience strong sales in Florida and the Gulf Coast regions as customers repair the damage caused by the hurricanes in 2005 and 2004. We experienced comparable store sales decreases in two Northeastern regions that had a slow, weather affected start in the first quarter and never fully recovered. In addition, certain areas of our North Central division suffered from headline making layoffs and plant closings, which contributed to these decreases in comparable store sales. We believe that our stores in these regions will experience improved performance in 2006. 16 The growth in our specialty sales initiatives, which include Installed Sales, Special Order Sales and Commercial Business Customer sales, also drove our sales increase in 2005. Our focus on execution under our Installed Sales model led to a 31% increase in Installed Sales over 2004. Our Installed Sales consist of both stock and special order product for which we arrange installation for our customers. Our growth in 2005 was driven by sales in cabinets & countertops, flooring and millwork. Special Order Sales increased 25% over 2004. We believe SOS will provide further growth opportunity, as we continue to enhance our offering to meet customers desires to express their individuality. Finally, we experienced double digit comparable store sales increases from Commercial Business Customers. Strengthening customer relationships, supported by targeted marketing and market specific merchandising assortments, continue to drive this part of our business. Gross margin For 2005, gross margin of 34.20% represented a 64 basis point increase over 2004. Approximately 40 basis points of the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2005 was due to the impact of the implementation of EITF 02 16 as it related to cooperative advertising and in store services, which reduced gross margin in 2004 as these funds were capitalized into inventory and recognized in income when the product was sold. The increase in 2005 gross margin was also driven by growth in imported goods, improvements in inventory shrink and positive sales mix impact. SG&A The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to increased 401(k) performance match contributions as a percentage of sales resulting from our increased profitability in 2005. In addition, there were increases as a percentage of sales in store remerchandising expense, which resulted from our continued investment in existing stores, and rent expense, as we continue to expand into metropolitan markets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in vendor provided store service costs as a percentage of sales. Our ongoing evaluation of in store vendor service expense has allowed us to appropriately adjust the level of vendor service in our stores, which led to the decrease as a percentage of sales. In addition, although there was an increase in advertising expense compared to 2004, we were able to enhance messaging and refine our marketing mix to make our advertising programs more productive, thereby resulting in the leverage of advertising expense as a percentage of sales in 2005. Store opening costs Store opening costs, which include payroll and supply costs incurred prior to store opening as well as grand opening advertising costs, are expensed as incurred and totaled $142 million in 2005 compared to $123 million in 2004. These costs are associated with the opening of 150 stores in 2005 (147 new and three relocated), as compared with the opening of 140 stores in 2004 (136 new and four relocated). Store opening costs for stores opened during the year averaged approximately $0.9 million per store in 2005 and 2004. Because store opening costs are expensed as incurred, the timing of expenses recognized may fluctuate based on the timing of store openings. Depreciation Depreciation leveraged eight basis points as a percentage of sales in 2005. At February 3, 2006, we owned 84% of our stores, compared to 81% at January 28, 2005, which includes stores on leased land. Property, less accumulated depreciation, increased to $16.4 billion at February 3, 2006, compared to $13.9 billion at January 28, 2005. The increase in property resulted primarily from our store expansion program and an additional investment in information technology. Interest Net interest expense is comprised of the following: (In Millions) 2005 2004 Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized $ 186 $ 172 Amortization of Original Issue Discount and Loan Costs 17 20 Interest Income (45 ) (16 ) Net Interest Expense $ 158 $ 176 Interest expense has increased primarily due to the October 2005 $1 billion debt issuance, partially offset by lower interest expense on convertible debt due to conversions during 2005. Interest expense relating to capital leases was $39 million for 2005 and $38 million for 2004. Interest income has increased primarily due to the investment of a portion of the proceeds from the October 2005 $1 billion debt issuance. For further discussion, see Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources. Income tax provision Our effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2005 and 2004. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net sales The increase in sales in 2004 was attributable to our ongoing store expansion and relocation program and comparable store sales increases. We opened 140 stores in 2004, including four relocations, adding our first stores in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Maine. The comparable store sales increase of 6.6% in 2004 reflected improved sales in every merchandising category. The categories that performed above our average comparable store sales increase for the year included millwork, rough plumbing, lumber, building materials, rough electrical, hardware, outdoor power equipment, seasonal living and cabinets & countertops. Inflation in lumber and building material prices during the year favorably impacted comparable store sales by approximately 150 basis points. 17 We experienced comparable store sales increases in every product category and all geographic regions due in part to the implementation of our merchandising and operations strategies. Our specialty sales initiatives, which include Installed Sales, SOS and Commercial Business Customer sales, also contributed to the comparable store sales increase in 2004. We completed the rollout of the new Installed Sales model to all of our stores during 2004. With the opportunity to expand into new categories of installation, we believe Installed Sales will continue to provide an area of future sales growth. We also experienced positive results from our SOS initiatives, with total SOS sales increasing approximately 27% in 2004. Our Commercial Business Customer initiative also performed well in 2004, with comparable store sales increases of over twice the company average and double digit comparable store sales increases in 15 of 18 merchandising categories. Our relationship with the Commercial Business Customer grew across the store, not just in lumber and building materials. Average ticket increased $4.22 or 7.1% from $59.21 in 2003 to $63.43 in 2004, due in part to the success of the Up the Continuum initiative as well as Lowes credit programs. Average ticket for comparable stores increased 6.3%. Gross margin The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was attributable primarily to the implementation of EITF 02 16. The implementation of EITF 02 16, which resulted in the reclassification of vendor reimbursements for cooperative advertising and third party in store service costs from SG&A expense to a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold, favorably impacted gross margin as a percentage of sales by 258 basis points for 2004. Excluding the impact of the implementation of EITF 02 16 as it related to cooperative advertising and in store services, gross margin as a percentage of sales was relatively flat compared to 2003. This was due in part to unfavorable product mix shifts and increased distribution costs. The increased distribution costs were associated with the R3 initiative, which includes adding safety stock to our distribution centers, reconfiguring racking and implementing new productivity standards. This strategy caused a temporary increase in our distribution costs, but with longer term positive implications for our in stock position, inventory productivity and SG&A leverage. Increased fuel prices also contributed to the increase in distribution costs. SG&A The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to the implementation of EITF 02 16, as previously discussed. This unfavorably impacted SG&A as a percentage of sales by 316 basis points for 2004. This was partially offset by leverage in gross advertising and salaries as a percentage of sales, as well as improvements in the performance of the credit portfolio held by General Electric. Store opening costs Store opening costs totaled $123 million in 2004 compared to $128 million in 2003. These costs were associated with the opening of 140 stores in 2004 (136 new and four relocated), as compared with the opening of 130 stores in 2003 (125 new and five relocated). Because store opening costs are expensed as incurred, the timing of expenses recognized may fluctuate based on the timing of store openings. Store opening costs for stores opened during the year averaged approximately $0.9 million per store in 2004 versus approximately $1 million per store in 2003. Depreciation Depreciation leveraged five basis points as a percentage of sales in 2004. Approximately 97% of new stores opened in the last three years have been owned, which included stores on leased land. Property, less accumulated depreciation, increased to $13.9 billion at January 28, 2005, compared to $11.8 billion at January 30, 2004. The increase in property resulted primarily from our store expansion program and an additional $300 million investment in information technology. Interest Interest expense decreased from 2003 due to lower debt levels resulting from scheduled debt repayments. Interest expense relating to capital leases was $38 million for 2004 and $39 million for 2003. For further discussion, see Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources. Income tax provision Our effective income tax rates were 38.5% and 37.9% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The higher rate in 2004 was primarily the result of expansion into states with higher state income tax rates. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The R3 initiative enables us to move safety stock out of our stores and into our RDC network. During 2004, safety stock was added to the distribution network prior to reducing the safety stock in the stores in order to maintain service levels. This resulted in inventory growth in 2004 that outpaced sales growth. However, in 2005, we started reducing safety stock in our stores and began to realize the benefits of the R3 initiative in the form of inventory leverage and inventory turn improvements. As a result, sales in 2005 increased 19% including the effect of the fifty third week, while inventory growth was 13%. We expect additional inventory improvements as a result of the R3 initiative in 2006. 18 Cash Flows The following table summarizes the components of the consolidated statements of cash flows, as well as the percentage change in cash from the prior year. This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements: Percentage Increase / (Decrease) in Cash from Prior Year (In Millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,842 $ 3,073 $ 3,034 25 % 1 % Net cash used in investing activities (3,674 ) (2,362 ) (2,487 ) (56 ) 5 Net cash used in financing activities (275 ) (1,047 ) (17 ) 74 NM Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (107 ) (336 ) 530 68 (163 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 530 866 336 (39 ) 158 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 423 $ 530 $ 866 (20 %) (39 %) NM: Not meaningful Cash flows from operating activities provide a significant source of our liquidity. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2005 resulted primarily from increased net earnings as well as a lower investment in inventory compared to 2004. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2004 resulted primarily from increased net earnings, offset by our investment in inventory as a part of the R3 initiative. Working capital at February 3, 2006, was $2.0 billion compared to $1.2 billion at January 28, 2005. The increase in working capital was due primarily to our October 2005 $1 billion debt issuance and increased net earnings, offset by the $600 million repayment of notes that matured in December 2005. The primary component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be new store and distribution facilities and the infrastructure and technology needed to support this growth. Cash acquisitions of fixed assets were $3.4 billion for 2005, $2.9 billion in 2004 and $2.3 billion in 2003. The February 3, 2006, retail selling space of 140 million square feet represented a 13% increase over January 28, 2005. The January 28, 2005, retail selling space of 124 million square feet represented a 14% increase over January 30, 2004. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of proceeds from the October 2005 issuance of $1 billion in senior notes and fewer repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program, offset by greater scheduled debt repayments. Financing uses of cash in 2004 were primarily the result of our share repurchase program. Financing uses of cash in 2003 primarily consisted of cash dividend payments, repayment of short term borrowings and scheduled debt repayments. These uses were partially offset by proceeds generated from stock option exercises and cash proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan. The ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 19.8%, 24.3%, and 26.9% as of the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sources of Liquidity In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have a $1 billion senior credit facility that expires in July 2009 that also provides a source of liquidity. The facility is available to support our $1 billion commercial paper program and for direct borrowings. Borrowings made are priced based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facility. The senior credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of a specific financial ratio. We were in compliance with those covenants at February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005. Fifteen banking institutions are participating in the $1 billion senior credit facility. As of February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility or under our commercial paper program. Four banks have extended lines of credit aggregating $420 million for the purpose of issuing documentary letters of credit and standby letters of credit. These lines do not have termination dates and are reviewed periodically. Commitment fees ranging from .25% to .50% per annum are paid on the letters of credit amounts outstanding. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $316 million as of February 3, 2006, and $304 million as of January 28, 2005. 19 Cash Requirements In January 2005, the Board of Directors authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases through 2006. This program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions. Shares purchased under the share repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. During 2005, we repurchased 25.0 million shares at a total cost of $774 million. In January 2006, the Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $1 billion in share repurchases through 2007. As of February 3, 2006, the total remaining authorization was $1.2 billion. Our quarterly cash dividend per share was increased in 2004 to $0.02 and again in 2005 to $0.03. This increased cash paid for dividends in 2005 as compared to 2004. Our 2006 capital budget is $4.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $387 million of leases. Approximately 79% of this planned commitment is for store expansion and new distribution centers. Expansion plans for 2006 consist of 155 stores, including five relocations of older stores. This planned expansion is expected to increase sales floor square footage by approximately 12%. Approximately 63% of the 2006 projects will be owned and 37% will be ground leased properties. At February 3, 2006, we owned and operated 11 regional distribution centers. We expect to open additional RDCs in Rockford, Illinois and Lebanon, Oregon in 2007. In addition, we plan to expand three existing distribution centers in Valdosta, Georgia, Statesville, North Carolina and North Vernon, Indiana by spring 2006. We also owned and operated 10 flatbed distribution centers and leased and operated two flatbed distribution centers for the handling of lumber, building materials and other long length items. We expect to open four additional flatbed distribution centers in 2006. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities will be adequate for our expansion plans and other operating requirements over the next 12 months. However, the availability of funds through the issuance of commercial paper and new debt could be adversely affected due to a debt rating downgrade or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. There are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price. Holders of the Senior Convertible Notes may convert their notes into 34.424 shares of the companys common stock only if: the sale price of the companys common stock reaches specified thresholds, or the credit rating of the notes is below a specified level, or the notes are called for redemption, or specified corporate transactions representing a change in control have occurred. There is no indication that we will not be able to maintain the minimum investment grade rating. During the fourth quarter of 2005, our closing share prices reached the specified threshold such that the Senior Convertible Notes would become convertible at the option of each holder into shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2006. Therefore, through May 5, 2006, holders may elect to convert each such note into 34.424 shares of common stock. In addition, if a change in control of the company occurs on or before October 2006, each holder of the Senior Convertible Notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holders notes. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time beginning October 2006, at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, on the redemption date. Our debt ratings at February 3, 2006, were as follows: Current Debt Ratings S&P Moodys Fitch Commercial Paper A1 P1 F1+ Senior Debt A+ A2 A+ Outlook Stable Positive Stable OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 20 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Less than 1 3 4 5 After 5 (In Millions) Total 1 year years years years Long Term Debt (principal and interest amounts, excluding discount) $ 6,038 $ 176 $ 390 $ 793 $ 4,679 Capital Lease Obligations 1 628 59 118 116 335 Operating Leases 1 4,918 279 561 556 3,522 Purchase Obligations 2 1,554 650 486 414 4 Subtotal Contractual Obligations $ 13,138 $ 1,164 $ 1,555 $ 1,879 $ 8,540 Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Less than 1 3 4 5 After 5 (In Millions) Total 1 year years years years Letters of Credit 3 $ 316 $ 315 $ 1 $ $ Total Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments $ 13,454 $ 1,479 $ 1,556 $ 1,879 $ 8,540 1 Amounts do not include taxes, common area maintenance or insurance. 2 Represents contracts for purchases of merchandise inventory, property and construction of buildings, as well as commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs. 3 Letters of credit are issued for the purchase of import merchandise inventories, real estate and construction contracts, and insurance programs. COMPANY OUTLOOK Our 2005 fiscal year contained 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 annual and fourth quarter comparisons will be negatively impacted by 52 versus 53 week and 13 versus 14 week comparisons, respectively. In addition, our 2006 quarterly comparisons will be impacted by a shift in comparable weeks to 2005. This week shift positively impacts first quarter and is offset by negative impacts in the second and fourth quarters. Our 2006 guidance contemplates these factors. As of February 27, 2006, the date of our fourth quarter 2005 earnings release, we expected to open 155 stores during 2006, resulting in total square footage growth of approximately 12%. We expected total sales to increase 13 14% and comparable store sales to increase 5 6%. Operating margin, defined as gross margin less SG&A and depreciation, was expected to increase approximately 20 basis points. In addition, store opening costs were expected to be approximately $130 million. Diluted earnings per share of $2.02 to $2.07 were expected for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2007. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We speak throughout this Annual Report about our future, particularly in the Letter to Shareholders and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. While we believe our estimates and expectations are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance. Our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations because, for example: Our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. We monitor key economic indicators including personal income, employment growth, housing turnover, and home ownership levels. In addition, changes in the level of repairs, remodeling and additions to existing homes, changes in commercial building activity, and the availability and cost of financing can impact our business. Major weather related events and unseasonable weather, particularly wet and cold weather during the spring and early summer months, may impact sales of seasonal merchandise and products designed for outdoor use on a short term basis. 21 Our expansion strategy may be impacted by environmental regulations, local zoning issues, availability and development of land, and more stringent land use regulations. Furthermore, our ability to secure a highly qualified workforce is an important element to the success of our expansion strategy. Our business is highly competitive, and as we build an increasing percentage of our new stores in larger markets and utilize new sales channels such as the Internet, we may face new and additional forms of competition. The ability to continue our everyday low pricing strategy and provide the products that customers want depends on our vendors providing a reliable supply of products at competitive prices and our ability to effectively manage our inventory. As an increasing number of the products we sell are imported, any restrictions or limitations on importation of such products, political or financial instability in some of the countries from which we import them, or a failure to comply with laws and regulation of those countries from which we import them, could interrupt our supply of imported inventory. Our goal of increasing our market share and our commitment to keeping our prices low require us to make substantial investments in new technology and processes whose benefits could take longer than expected to be realized and which can be difficult to implement and integrate. For more information about these and other risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to, you should read the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. All subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K. We do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. 22
