Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation is a leading supplier of technically complex thin film selective removal equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, CMP and post CMP wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over the past three business cycles, the severity of the semiconductor business cycle has increased. Demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, economic conditions, supply and demand for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive new products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Total Revenue Our total revenues were $943.1 million, $1,519.8 million and $1,230.8 million for fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Total revenue of $1,519.8 million in fiscal 2001 reflected the adoption of SAB 101 as of the beginning of that year. The decrease in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market. During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we began to see signs of a downturn. Excess inventory of telecommunication products, diminished personal computer sales and a slowing economy caused semiconductor companies to sharply reduce capital expenditures and delay or cancel equipment orders. These order reductions had a negative impact on the level of our systems shipments starting in the June 2001 quarter. Revenues decreased across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002. While the overall industry slowed, our customers continued to make selective purchases to support development of processes needed for smaller device feature sizes and for copper and new materials integration, as well as the transition to 300 mm size wafers. Revenue in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 reflected a period of expansion in our served markets driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for increased capacity. In addition, our customers were transitioning to smaller geometries and new materials such as copper. Proportionally, more of our revenue growth can be attributed to our etch family of products. We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." Refer to our discussion of "Critical Accounting Policies" for additional information about our revenue recognition policy. Based on the guidance provided by SAB 101, we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation. Systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment. Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 30, June 24, June 25, 2002 2001 2000 North America...................... 29% 30% 29% Europe............................. 21% 28% 28% Asia Pacific....................... 35% 33% 31% Japan.............................. 15% 9% 12% A modest recovery in demand for wafer fabrication equipment during the last half of fiscal 2002 supports our current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter, 2003, compared to the prior quarter, as current manufacturing activity by our customers has improved. Gross Margin Gross margin was $266.1 million, $653.5 million and $541.9 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, gross margins were 28.2%, 43.0% and 44.0% in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 stems from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes. Additionally inventory write downs of approximately $24.1 million and a patent litigation settlement charge of $38.8 million, in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and inventory related net restructuring charges, after recoveries, of $5.9 million unfavorably impacted gross margins in fiscal 2002. The decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs in the second half of fiscal 2001, due to the industry slowdown. During the last quarter of fiscal 2002, we experienced a favorable gross margin progression due to better capacity utilization of both our factory and field service resources and from the impact of cost reduction programs. Excluding restructuring reserve recovery, gross margin for the June 2002 quarter was 35.9% of total revenue, compared to 33.5% of total revenue in the March 2002 quarter. Our current outlook is for gross margin as a percent of revenue to rise sequentially in the first fiscal quarter, 2003, due to higher revenues and increased production efficiencies. Research and Development R&D expenses were $179.2 million, $227.2 million and $176.9 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expenses were 19.0%, 15.0% and 14.4% for fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily the result of lower sales volume. The decrease in R&D expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 results from controlled spending on general R&D programs, consistent with the downturn in the business cycle. The increase in R&D expenses in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by expanded levels of investment in advanced etch and CMP/Clean applications, including developing the technology necessary to support smaller geometries, new insulating materials, copper based devices and 300 mm size wafers. We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in R&D. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs. We expect to continue making sizeable investments in advanced etch and CMP/Clean applications and in enhancing our existing products during fiscal 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses (excluding restructuring charges/recoveries) were $161.9 million, $218.9 million and $161.3 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenses (excluding restructuring charges/recoveries) were 17.2%, 14.4% and 13.1% in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is largely due to manpower reductions, lower incentive payments to employees, shutdown days and other cost reduction programs. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002, is primarily the result of lower sales volume. The increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by infrastructure expansion needed to sustain higher sales, marketing, and administrative support for our expanding business in the first half of fiscal 2001. SG&A increased as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2001, largely due to the decline in sequential quarterly revenue starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Restructuring Charges We have developed restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels. Expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities including downsizing and reorganizations and business exit activities related to discontinued product lines. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans. Although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan, the nature of our extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective. The recognition of a restructuring event does not necessarily exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods. In April 2001, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce up to 15% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 ("the June 2001 Plan"). The reduction in force was driven by the then anticipated level of decline in our revenues due to the forecasted contraction of our served market from calendar year 2000 levels. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the June 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately 11% prior to June 24, 2001. We recorded a restructuring charge of $16.8 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and charges for inventories of an etch product line that has been discontinued. In addition, we consolidated our Fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote off the carrying cost of abandoned facility assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered $1.4 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. We also recovered $0.9 million from certain of our etch product line inventory, previously segregated and written off. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2001 Plan: LEASE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ABANDONED OTHER AND ON VACATED FIXED DISCONTINUED EXIT BENEFITS FACILITIES ASSETS INVENTORY COSTS TOTAL (in thousands) Fiscal year 2001 provision......$ 8,282 $ 1,312 $ 3,036 $ 3,732 $ 407 $ 16,769 Cash payments...................

Prior to the date of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees being terminated would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.5 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002. Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given the prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub lease our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. When applicable, anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments. We wrote off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $1.5 million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. In addition, certain demonstration equipment and etch product line inventory were abandoned and written off. Other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated with capital improvements to the vacated facilities. Our business outlook in mid to late summer of 2001, indicated further deterioration in semiconductor sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, resulting in a lower outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in our revenues. Consequently, in August 2001, we announced a new plan ("the September 2001 Plan") to further reduce our fixed cost infrastructure, including an approximate 10% reduction in force. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the September 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduced our workforce by approximately 550 employees, worldwide prior to September 23, 2001. We recorded a restructuring charge of $21.0 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, write offs for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and charges for inventories of selected, older etch product lines that were discontinued. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered $0.7 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We also recovered $0.8 million from certain of our older etch inventories, previously segregated and written off and $0.3 million from facilities leases. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2001 Plan: LEASE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ABANDONED AND ON VACATED FIXED DISCONTINUED BENEFITS FACILITIES ASSETS INVENTORY TOTAL (in thousands) Fiscal year 2002 provision......$ 10,767 $ 1,746 $ 935 $ 7,600 $ 21,048 Recovery of assets............... 785 785 Cash payments....................

Prior to September 23, 2001, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.9 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002. Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in Fremont, California. We wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $0.9 million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, we exited selected, older etch product lines and wrote off the related discontinued manufacturing inventory. The continued and severe degradation in the wafer fabrication equipment market in late calendar year 2001 and its impact on our near term financial forecast necessitated another restructuring plan ("the December 2001 Plan"). In December 2001, we publicly announced our intention to reduce global employment by approximately 12% and further consolidate our facilities. During the second fiscal quarter, the December 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduction of our workforce by approximately 470 employees, worldwide prior to December 30, 2001. We recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2001 Plan: LEASE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ABANDONED AND ON VACATED FIXED BENEFITS FACILITIES ASSETS TOTAL (in thousands) Fiscal year 2002 provision......$ 14,208 $ 9,637 $ 9,928 $ 33,773 Cash payments...................

Prior to December 30, 2001, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $3.6 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002. Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in Fremont, California. We wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $8.8 million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, certain fixed assets of approximately $1.1 million associated with these facilities had no future economic benefit and have been abandoned and written off. As summarized above, restructuring activities have had a significant impact on our operating results. As discussed under "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" below, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (FAS 146). Had FAS 146 been applicable when we undertook our restructuring activities, the timing and amount of the charges recognized may have been different than those reported. FAS 146 is applicable to restructuring activities initiated on or after December 31, 2002 with early adoption encouraged. FAS 146 does not apply to our previous restructuring activities. Asset Impairment Charges During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that the carrying value of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment to be disposed of exceeded its fair value less cost to sell. Fair value was assessed using the market values of similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment. Impairment occurred due to rapid technological changes brought about by the semiconductor industrys move to copper and 300 mm applications. In accordance with FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of", we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $9.5 million. A $5.3 million write down to fair value of certain laboratory tools is included in R&D expenses and $4.2 million of write downs to fair value of demonstration equipment are included in SG&A expenses. Remaining equipment with carrying values totaling $1.1 million is reviewed quarterly for incremental impairment and is anticipated to be disposed of within the next 12 months. Patent Litigation Settlement On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years) and issued a warrant with a fair value of $21.5 million that entitled Varian to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $21.30 per share. As part of the full and final settlement, Varian and Lam agreed to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims relating to the litigation. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8 million in the quarter ended December 30, 2001, which represents approximately 93% of the total value of the settlement. The remaining portion of the total value of the settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents, $2.7 million, is being amortized ratably over 10 quarters. The imputed value of the warrant was determined using the Black Scholes valuation model. The key assumptions used in the valuation model were an expected life of 4 years, anticipated stock price volatility of 61% and a risk free interest rate of 4.5%. Purchased Technology for Research & Development During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we made an equity investment in, and purchased a portfolio of CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh. We recognized a one time charge to income of $8.0 million for the purchase of in process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million investment in preferred stock and intangible assets. Our equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of Strasbaughs total capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five years. Based on our analysis of Strasbaughs current and expected financial performance, we determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an other than temporary impairment and recorded a $2.0 million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Our equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was ($0.8) million and $0.7 million, respectively. The income (loss) has not been material, and, therefore, has not been itemized in other income, net, on the accompanying statements of operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, we purchased intellectual property rights related to the semiconductor equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc ("Oliver"). We recognized an expense for the purchase of research and development technology of approximately $7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents, which are being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years. The technology is being used in a next generation product development project and has no future alternative use. Other Income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, was ($8.2) million, $15.1 million and $7.0 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates in fiscal 2002, the non taxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to Lam stock, and the decrease in foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances. The increase in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by higher interest income on a substantially larger average investment portfolio. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we applied Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00 19, in accounting for our equity derivatives indexed to our own stock. In accordance with EITF 00 19, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset. The cumulative change was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement, if any, will be non taxable. We adjust the carrying value of these derivative instruments to their fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or lose in our statement of operations. For additional information about our accounting for these equity derivatives, refer to our discussion of Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock, included in Critical Accounting Polices in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Based on a June 28, 2002 stock price of $17.98, the fair value of the equity derivatives was $24.8 million, which resulted in a non taxable loss of $8.2 million for fiscal 2002. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our effective annual income tax rate was 31.7%, excluding the loss on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal year 2002, and 30.0% and 13.5% in fiscal years 2001 and 2000, respectively. The cumulative loss from the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock is non taxable. The fiscal year 2000 rate reflected the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over from prior periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, income tax benefit was recorded using a 10.0% tax rate estimate; income tax benefit in subsequent fiscal 2002 quarters was recorded using a 30.0% tax benefit rate estimate. The increase in the tax benefit rate results from the tax benefit of the R&D credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and our continued and substantial investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for R&D tax benefits. Deferred Tax Assets We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards of $290.4 million, $244.1 million and $202.5 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $52.2 million, $31.2 million and $94.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of $26.7 million, $35.6 million and $19.0 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income and we believe that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted profitability. However, there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Outsourcing We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these capabilities. We have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products, to market and sell what we develop and to service and support directly with our customers, what we sell. Most other activities in the company are in support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service. Consequently, over the last 15 months, we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties. Accordingly, during fiscal 2002, we entered into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, facilities management and information technology functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing programs may provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down, in a more timely and cost effective manner to respond to requirements generated by the cyclical nature of our business. Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business. Related Party Transactions During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with Lam entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars at 6.75% simple interest. At June 30, 2002, the entire principal amount, $1.0 million, and accrued interest was outstanding. The loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable, in full, together with accrued interest, at any time, but no later than May 8, 2005. Subsequent Events The 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, ("5% Notes"), matured on September 2, 2002 and were repaid in full. This resulted in a cash outlay of approximately $309.8 million. At the end of August 2002, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock with a market value of $47.6 million ($13.60 per share) by physically settling certain put and call option contracts (equity derivative contracts), which gave us the right to repurchase the shares for $39.1 million ($11.19 per share) from independent third parties. By settling the equity derivative contracts, we were able to repurchase the shares at a discount of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) from their fair market value. As a result of this transaction, we recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million. From June 30, 2002 through the settlement date, the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million as a result of changes in the fair value of our common stock over the same period. This reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value will be included in our earnings for the quarter ending September 29, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we will recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications. Revenue related to spare parts sales, system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." Prior to fiscal year 2001, the Companys revenue recognition policy was generally to recognize revenue for sales of equipment at the time of shipment. As a result of our change in revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, and the cumulative effect of the change on our financial statements, the deferred revenue balance upon adopton of SAB 101, as of June 26, 2000, was $433.0 million, consisting of equipment that was shipped but had not yet been accepted as of June 25, 2000. Of this amount, we recognized revenue of $29.1 million and $401.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. At June 30, 2002, the deferred revenue balance, including $2.9 million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment, was approximately $121.2 million. Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock: In November 2000, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 19, "Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer", for the purposes of applying EITF Issue No. 96 13, "Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock" ("EITF 00 19"). EITF 96 13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a companys own stock ("equity derivatives") by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity, temporary equity and assets and liabilities. Under EITF 00 19, equity derivatives that were issued prior to September 20, 2000, and classified as permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be re classified as assets or liabilities. To qualify as permanent equity, all the following criteria must be met: the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares, the company must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract, the contract must contain an explicit limit on the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement, there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral, there can be no "make whole" provisions in the contract that require cash settlement and there can be no provisions in the contract that indicate the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder. Equity derivative contracts accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value, and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the contract classification occurs. Equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations. Lam equity derivatives include certain put and call options indexed to our own stock. Application of EITF 00 19 requires these instruments be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period, the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or loss on our statement of operations. Our equity derivatives are collateralized by restricted cash of $9.1 million and may not be settled in unregistered shares. In accordance with EITF 00 19, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of these put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset. The June 24, 2001 cumulative effect adjustment, a gain of $33.1 million ($0.25 per diluted share), was based on a June 24, 2001 stock price of $28.50. The cumulative change in fair value was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement will be non taxable. Based on a June 28, 2002, stock price of $17.98, the $24.8 million fair value of the equity derivatives resulted in a non taxable loss of $8.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2002. The loss is recorded in Other Income (Expense)in the June 2002 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of the options is recorded in Other Current Assets. See "Subsequent Events" included herein Item 7 "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"for information concerning the settlement of our equity derivatives. Refer to Item 7A, "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for additional information about our investments in equity derivative financial instruments. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market using standard costs, which approximate actual cost. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers, we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products. Standard costs are generally re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead for manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to fully absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. The assembly outsourcing initiative has and will continue to alter the composition of reported cost of sales. Over time, proportionately more costs will comprise purchased materials and less will represent manufacturing labor and overhead, reflecting the substitution of our assembly activities with the purchase of completed modules and integrated units from new outsource assembly vendors. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months based on estimated customer product orders is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Installation and Warranty: Typically, part of marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes installing and providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We generally record actual labor and material expenses for installation activities to cost of sales upon equipment acceptance and revenue recognition. We also provide a contractual performance warranty on our systems, the period of which runs concurrent with the system installation process, generally 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as a new, simpler installation process or the impact of system reliability improvements. Where customer and system specific installation and warranty reserves are established, all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses incurred on a system by system basis, and overall, may differ from our original estimates. While we consistently monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified provisions or reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. Historically, including the most recent 12 months ended June 30 2002, all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the company provides customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services, with a term of more than one month, are recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. At June 30, 2002, warranty reserves were $15.5 million, compared to $28.3 million at June 24, 2001. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans: We account for our stock purchase plan and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and make pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting For Stock Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), were followed. Our employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Because our stock based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock based awards to employees. Deferred Income Taxes: We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future estimated taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options. When these tax benefits are realized, the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Impairment or Disposals of Long Lived Assets: In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("FAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". FAS 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", and applies to all long lived assets (including discontinued operations). We are required to adopt FAS 144 at the beginning of fiscal 2003. FAS 144 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results. Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities: In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146"). FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). The principal difference between FAS 146 and EITF 94 3 relates to FAS 146s requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94 3 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. FAS 146 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations. Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities: In June 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements "Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities"(the proposed Interpretation or Exposure Draft) that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of special purpose entities ("SPE"). The proposed Interpretation will apply to any business enterprise, both public and private, that has a controlling interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with an SPE. The Exposure Draft provides guidance for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a SPE, that functions to support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. The proposed Interpretation may result in our having to consolidate the operating results of a SPE or similar entity, which is a lessor under one of our operating lease agreements. The FASB expects to issue the Interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2002. The effective date of these proposed new rules on our current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal quarter ending June 2003, and sooner on any new leases entered into after the new rules effective date which utilize SPEs or equivalent lease structures. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule, could require us to consolidate the activities of the SPE and recognize the asset and related liability. Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others: In May 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed Interpretation that would require a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The proposed Interpretation would also require a company ("the guarantor") to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The proposed Interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent measurement of the guarantors recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee. The proposed Interpretaton would also incorporate, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34, "Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others " which is being superseded. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 25, 2002 and would be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The proposed Interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2002, we had $945.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash compared with $925.4 million at June 24, 2001. Subsequent event: The 5% Notes, principal amount of $309.8 million, matured on September 2, 2002, and were redeemed in cash. The proceeds we used to redeem the 5% Notes came primarily from short term investments that had matured subsequent to June 30, 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities was $21.8 million in fiscal 2002. Net loss for the year of $90.1 million adjusted for non cash charges of $138.5 million, resulted in positive cash flow of $48.4 million, which was partially offset by uses of working capital totaling $26.6 million. Non cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization, patent litigation settlement, restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, impairment charges and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in company stock. Significant changes in current assets and liabilities resulted from improved accounts receivable turnover and the continued use of programs to selectively sell accounts receivables, which resulted in a $118.2 million improvement. Additionally, highly controlled purchasing processes combined with lower shipments and inventory write downs for excess, obsolete, and older generation products reduced inventory by approximately $96.5 million. Accrued liabilities declined by $65.4 million due to reduced compensation and warranty liabilities. Deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell $187.4 million, in line with equipment delivery trends. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 was $88.1 million, down from $427.5 million in 2001. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2002 included net purchases of short term investments of $65.4 million and limited capital expenditure projects of $10.6 million. Additionally, restricted cash increased $10.5 million, mostly due to collateral requirements of our interest rate swap agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2002 was $16.3 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock generated $19.4 million. We repurchased $10.7 million of common stock and reissued $16.3 million of treasury stock through the employee stock purchase program. Principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations were $8.7 million. Property and equipment was $67.5 million at June 30, 2002, compared to $126.5 million at June 24, 2001. The decrease in property and equipment in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily due to minimum expenditures for capital projects during fiscal 2002, write offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities, and impairments of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment. At June 30, 2002, our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt retirements, lease payments, other long term liabilities, and outsourced functions are as follow: Debt and other Outsourcing long term Operating and Consignment liabilities Leases Contracts (in thousands) Through June 29, 2003 (1)........ $ 315,291 $ 63,553 $ 34,321 2004 through 2006................ 359,691 86,909 9,586 2007 and thereafter.............. 7,687 Total ......................... $ 674,982 $ 158,149 $ 43,907 (1) The 5% Notes, principal amount of $309.8 million, mature on September 2, 2002 and are included in the Current Liabilities section of the Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2002. Debt financing includes two Convertible Subordinated Notes and a Yen denominated term loan. Details of the Convertible notes are: Description 4% Convertible Subordinated Notes, "4% Notes" 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, "5% Notes" Offering Date May 2001 August 1997 Offering Amount $300.0 million $310.0 million Maturity Date June 1, 2006 September 2, 2002 Offering Expenses $8.5 million incurred at the time of offering, ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the 4% Notes. Remaining unamortized balance of $6.7 million and $8.4 million at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, respectively. $9.0 million incurred at the time of offering ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the 5% Notes. Remaining unamortized balance of $0.3 million and $2.1 million at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, respectively. Interest Rate terms 4% payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1 2001 5% payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1 1998 Conversion Rights Convertible into Lam Common Stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $44.93 per share subject to anti dilution adjustments Convertible into Lam Common Stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $29.26 per share subject to anti dilution adjustments Redemption terms Redeemable at Lam option, beginning June 5, 2004 with at least 20 days and no more than 60 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest. Redeemable at Lam option, beginning September 6, 2000 with at least 20 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 102.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest, if the closing price of Lam Common Stock is at least 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days ending within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within 5 trading days prior to the notice of redemption Security 4% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company 5% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we entered into a three year Yen denominated term loan for approximately &yen;6.0 billion ($48.5 million at June 30, 2002) with a syndicate of financial institutions, in order to fund our Japanese subsidiary operations. The entire principal amount under the new term loan is due at maturity, June 11, 2004, and has a floating interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ("TIBOR"), which at June 30, 2002, was 2.6% per annum. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Companys 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The transaction swapped 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") based interest rate, resulting in interest expense savings of approximately $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. Should 6 month LIBOR interest rates rise above approximately 5% per annum in future periods, incremental interest expense to the Company may be incurred. Under the terms of the transaction, we must provide collateral to match any mark to market exposure on the swap. The amount of collateral required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus an amount equal to the mark to market exposure on the swap. Therefore, the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark to market exposure on the swap instrument. Generally the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise. At the end of fiscal 2002 we have $10.5 million in restricted cash on our balance sheet (classified as a long term asset) related to this transaction. The swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Note E of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10K. On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years). The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above includes our cash obligations at June 30, 2002, related to the Varian settlement. We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Generally, all of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain operating leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods. Certain of our other facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Lease agreements relating to certain buildings at our Fremont, California campus, require us to provide guaranteed residual values totaling $97.1 million at the end of the respective lease terms which are reflected in the preceding table ($44.4 million in 2003, $25.2 million in 2005 and $27.5 million in 2006). The lessor associated with one of these lease agreements is a SPE or equivalent structure. Presently, we account for this lease as an operating lease while the SPE owns and accounts for the leased assets and related liabilities. The FASB has issued an Exposure Draft "Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entites", a proposed Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of SPEs. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule, could require us to consolidate the activities of the SPE and recognize the asset and related liability. Additionally, one of our lease agreements includes collateral restrictions that require us to maintain a certain amount of cash, $51.4 million at June 30, 2002, in restricted specified interest bearing accounts. These restricted cash accounts must be maintained through March 2003 (unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of required cash collateral is reduced), as the underlying obligation is paid down by the lessor. During the second half of fiscal 2002, we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance and information technology functions. These outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum outsourcing obligations at June 30, 2002 under these arrangements. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the assumption of leases, assets and employees. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as inventory until title is transferred or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 30, 2002, vendor owned inventories held at Lam and not reported as inventory were approximately $15 million. In fiscal 1999, we entered into certain option transactions with independent third parties (the "third parties") for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties options to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of our Common Stock. These call options were to be acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes previously issued by us, and which became due September 2, 2002. As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized us to enter into the sale of put options with the same third parties covering up to 15.75 million shares of our Common Stock. We anticipated that the premiums we would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in full the premium cost of our purchase of the call options from those same third parties. Pursuant to the authorization described above, as of June 30, 2002, we have acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our Common Stock; the weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the 5% Notes issued in August 1997, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share. On June 1, 2002, all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired. As of June 30, 2002, we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 3.04 million shares of our Common Stock, giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.32 per share. The call and put options are European style options exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no later than September 3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the 5% Notes must either be converted or retired. Upon option exercise, we have the ability, at our discretion, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e., shares would be delivered to us against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party to the other of the value of the option being exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option being exercised). Certain scenarios may require that we deliver cash to the counter party to achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments. We can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate Third Party. While the options are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the options upon the occurrence of certain events (in a form determined by us which includes net settlement of shares), including without limitation our material breach of the agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to our financial condition, reduction in our S&P credit rating below B or a drop in the price of our Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share. We account for these derivative financial instruments, indexed and potentially settled in our stock, under the provisions of EITF 00 19. At June 30, 2002, the instruments had a net fair value of $24.8 million and are included in "Other Current Assets". If the average stock price is below $9.32 during any period, the required number of shares to net settle the Companys obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive earnings per share ("EPS") calculation. See "Subsequent Events" included herein Item 7 "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning the repayment of our 5% Notes that matured September 2, 2002 and the settlement of our equity derivatives. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 30, 2002, combined with cash conservation activities, are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, capital expenditures, settlement in cash of our 5% Notes which matured on September 2 2002, and settlement of equity derivative contracts through at least the end of calendar year 2003. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues, and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products. Risk Factors Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: economic conditions in the semiconductor industry generally, and the equipment industry specifically; the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; customer acceptances of equipment; the size and timing of orders from customers; customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations and or acceptances; our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; our competitors introduction of new products; legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; new or modified accounting regulations; changes in average selling prices and product mix; changes in import/export regulations; exchange rate fluctuations; and exposure on interest rate swap agreements. We manage our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. We derive our revenue primarily from the shipment and acceptance of a relatively small number of high priced systems. Our systems can range in price from approximately $400,000 to $4 million per unit. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated future revenues, and a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Our operating results for a quarter may suffer substantially if: we ship fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter; our customers delay final acceptance of our shipments; we do not receive anticipated purchase orders in time to enable shipment or acceptance of equipment during a given quarter; one or more customers delays or cancels anticipated shipments and or installations; shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or manufacturing or transportation difficulties; or our suppliers or outsource vendors fail to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations. Further, because most of our manufacturing and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California facility, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and product installation commitments. Prior to SAB 101, we generally recognized new systems revenue on the date the equipment was shipped to customers. Under SAB 101, we now generally recognize revenue for new equipment on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. In late fiscal 1999, increased demand for our products drove revenue growth throughout fiscal 2000 and early fiscal 2001. In the later part of the December 2000 quarter, we began to see signs that this upturn was slowing and that customers were considering reductions in equipment purchases during the first half of calendar year 2001. These signs were confirmed in calendar year 2001, as semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity. The resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal 2002. Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers and pricing volatility are expected to continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will continue to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at alignment of our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in product research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. For this Reason, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture, and successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. Due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products, we strive to accurately forecast demand for new products while managing the transition from older products. If new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace, which would materially and adversely affect our results from operations. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We may be unable in a timely manner to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. In addition, in connection with the development of new products, we will invest in pilot production inventory. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. We are Subject to Risks Associated with the Introduction of New Products We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, our own introduction of new products represents significant investments of our resources and their success, or lack thereof, could have a material effect on our financial results. We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: a decline in demand for our products; a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products; an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Generally, each of our key suppliers has a one year blanket purchase contract under which we may issue purchase orders. We may renew these contracts periodically. Each of these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers. Several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to Lam; where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect We are expanding the role that outsource providers play in our business. We anticipate that these outsource providers will play keys roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers will fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expanded role of outsource providers will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitors Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitors Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to that Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular suppliers processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors equipment. We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. In addition, there are smaller, emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. We anticipate our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics. If our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, it could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. In addition, competitors with higher levels of financial resources than we have may deeply discount or give away products similar to those we sell. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and or cash flows. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales Non U.S. sales accounted for approximately 71% of our total revenue in fiscal 2002, 70% in fiscal 2001 and 71% in fiscal 2000. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. International sales are subject to risks, including, but not limited to: foreign exchange risks; changing import/export requirements; foreign trade disputes; and economic, political, banking and currency problems in the relevant region. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Yen denominated sales and assets, and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future. A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. Our Ability to Manage Potential Growth or Decline; Integration of Potential Acquisitions and Potential Disposition of Product Lines and Technologies Creates Risks for Us Current conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry challenges our management to control spending on operating activities. If we experience rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform such actions successfully. In the future, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of managements attention to other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such growth, decline, integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. Any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and or the price of our Common Stock. The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, which May Affect our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; global economic fluctuations; variations in our quarterly operating results; variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast; announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations or introduction of new products; government regulations; developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or political, economic or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Recent volatility in the price of our Common Stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies become the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert managements attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. Risk Associated With Our Interest Rate Swap Agreement We aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations. To minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300 million. We entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate. If 6 month LIBOR based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings. However, a rise in 6 month LIBOR based interest rates above approximately 5 % per annum in future periods could result in incremental levels of interest expense. The Potential Anti Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the "Rights Plan") in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals. Our Rights Plan may have certain anti takeover effects. Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with "interested stockholders", as defined by that statute. Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. Additionally, from time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In September 1999, Tegal Corporation sued us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents Tegal holds. Specifically, Tegal identified our 4520XLe and Exelan products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and we may fail to prevail in this litigation. However, we believe that the Tegal lawsuit will not materially adversely affect our operating results or financial position. See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the Tegal lawsuit. We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations at June 30, 2002, and June 24, 2001: June 30, June 24, 2002 2001 THERE FAIR 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 AFTER TOTAL VALUE TOTAL ($ in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate............. $145,700 $145,700 $145,700 $175,000 Average rate............. 1.87% 1.87% 4.03% Short term investments Fixed rate............. $368,469 $130,756 $499,225 $499,225 $505,050 Average rate............. 4.32% 3.27% 4.04% 4.94% Auction rate preferreds Variable rate.......... $202,549 $202,549 $202,549 $137,850 Average rate............. 2.13% 2.13% 4.36% Restricted cash Fixed rate ............ $60,433 $10,550 $70,983 $70,983 $60,800 Average rate............. 2.36% 3.41% 2.52% 4.79% Total investment Securities............. $777,151 $141,306 $918,457 $918,457 $878,700 Average rate............. 3.14% 3.28% 3.15% 4.66% Long term debt Fixed rate............. $310,260 300,000 $610,260 $566,010 $618,936 Average rate............. 5.00% 4.00% 4.51% 4.45% Variable rate.......... $48,535 $48,535 $48,535 $49,263 Average rate............. 2.60% 2.61% 1.81% Total long term Debt $310,260 $48,535 $300,000 $658,795 $614,545 $668,199 Average rate............. 5.00% 2.60% 4.00% 4.37% 4.26% We mitigate default risk by targeting investments in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We have no cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate $309.8 million and $300.0 million Convertible Subordinated Notes. However, we do have cash flow exposures on the interest expense related to our &yen;6.0 billion ($48.5 million at June 30, 2002) Yen denominated bank term loan because the lending rates under that term loan vary with TIBOR. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Yen denominated assets. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are adjusted to fair value and recorded in other income and expense. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. On June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $48.3 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 30, 2002, was $0.8 million. A 15% appreciation of the yen would result in an unrealized loss of $8.5 million, while depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $6.4 million. On June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as balance sheet hedges was $13.7 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 30, 2002, was $8.6 thousand. A 15% appreciation of the yen would result in an unrealized gain of $2.4 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized loss of $1.8 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300.0 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Companys 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate. At June 30, 2002, the fair value of the swap, $3.2 million, is recorded in Other Long Term Assets. An increase in rates by 1% would result in an incremental loss of $9.9 million. A decrease in rates by 1% would result in an incremental gain of $10.3 million. During fiscal 1999, we entered into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock, in order to offset the dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the $309.8 million 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due September 2, 2002. As of June 30, 2002, we acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our Common Stock. The weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the Notes, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share. On June 1, 2002, all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired. As of June 30, 2002, we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 3.04 million shares of our Common Stock, giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.32 per share. See "Subsequent Events" included herein Item 7 "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information concerning the repayment of our 5% Notes that matured September 2, 2002 and the settlement of our equity derivatives. Below is a table showing, at assumed exercise prices for the put and call options and market prices for our Common Stock, our anticipated gain or (loss) under the put and call options upon exercise or upon maturity of the options transaction. AT June 30, 2002 AT MATURITY (in thousands) Stock Value $5.00 ($13,264) ($13,122) $15.00 $14,368 $13,814 $25.00 $46,704 $51,029 $29.26 $54,617 $66,877 $35.00 $62,256 $66,877 $45.00 $65,934 $66,877 $55.00 $66,538 $66,877 Based on a June 28, 2002 stock price of $17.98, the fair value of the equity derivatives was $24.8 million, which resulted in a non taxable loss of $8.2 million for the year, ended June 30, 2002. The fair value of the options is recorded in Other Current Assets, as the instruments mature during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
