Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of semiconductor capital equipment. Our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, CMP and CMP wafer cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over the past 3 business cycles, their severity has increased, and todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns are no more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and price for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. 16 Table of Contents Total Revenue Year Ended Percent Change 2003 2002 June 29, June 30, June 24, versus versus 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 (in thousands) Revenue $ 755,234 $ 943,114 $ 1,519,789 (19.9 %) (37.9 %) The sequential decrease in revenue for fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 reflects our customers response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry, which was significantly influenced by the continued retrenchment of the global economy and levels of end user demand for products servicing telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics markets. Semiconductor manufacturers have selectively invested in leading edge technology equipment through fiscal 2003 and are in the early stages of ramping these new capabilities at production volumes. Overall, demand has remained relatively flat during fiscal 2003 as reflected in the pattern of our quarterly revenues. Our current estimate for the September 2003 quarter is for revenues to be approximately at the same levels as the June 2003 quarter revenues. The downturn that began in the second half of fiscal 2001 resulted in decreased revenues across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002. The reduction in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and severe contraction in capital investments. We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Refer to our discussion of Critical Accounting Policies for additional information about our revenue recognition policy. Based on the guidance provided by SAB 101, we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications, after system installation. Systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment. Spares revenues generally are recognized on the date of shipment, and service revenues are recognized generally upon performance of the activities requested by the customer, including training, upgrades, and extended warranty support. Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year ended June 29, June 30, June 24, 2003 2002 2001 North America 28 % 29 % 30 % Europe 20 % 21 % 28 % Asia Pacific 44 % 35 % 33 % Japan 8 % 15 % 9 % The growth of Asia Pacific revenues reflects expanded foundry operations and investments by memory chip manufacturers to lower their operating costs by introducing latest generation manufacturing equipment. 17 Table of Contents Gross Margin Percent Change Year Ended 2003 2002 June 29, June 30, June 24, versus versus 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 (in thousands) Gross Margin $ 303,829 $ 266,089 $ 653,479 14.2 % (59.3 %) Percent of total revenue 40.2 % 28.2 % 43.0 % The increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of 12 percentage points in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was accomplished with an approximate 20 percent reduction in revenues over the same periods. We have focused on implementing strategies to outsource manufacturing activities in order to lower our breakeven point to approximately $180 million in quarterly revenues at the end of fiscal 2003. Further outsourcing of manufacturing assembly activities was accomplished throughout fiscal 2003, continuing the trend toward achieving a more variable cost structure, by establishing transaction based pricing agreements with vendors, and, additionally enabling the elimination of infrastructure costs such as facilities. The same strategy has provided opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base. The manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes. One objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles. Specifically related to this point, in fiscal 2002, we incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of $24.1 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and in addition we incurred $5.9 million of inventory restructuring expenses, contributing to approximately a 450 basis points improvement in the gross margin percentage compared to fiscal 2003. The charges in fiscal 2002 reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time. The reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal 2003 reflects more stability in quarter on quarter business levels during the year and other inventory management efforts. Our current outlook for the September 2003 quarter is for essentially flat gross margin as a percentage of revenues compared to the June 2003 quarter. Approximately 500 basis points of the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2003 compared to the corresponding period a year ago is a result of $38.8 million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2002. In the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian). We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash and issued Varian a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $21.5 million. In connection with this settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8 million, and the remaining amount of the settlement, $2.7 million, represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received. The $2.7 million relating to the license will continue to be amortized ratably over the subsequent 10 quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold. Accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2003 was $1.6 million. Additionally, our restructuring plans, combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing operations, contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002. The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 stems from 18 Table of Contents patent litigation settlement charges and obsolete inventory charges within cost of goods sold as well as unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes. In the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge for excess and obsolete inventory of $24.1 million. We recorded the charge based on the results of our customary quarterly analysis of inventories and their net realizable value based on current market conditions and forecasted customer demand for related products. This analysis highlighted limited anticipated consumption of our older generation equipment due to accelerated technological and product design changes. Research and Development Percent Change Year Ended 2003 2002 June 29, June 30, June 24, versus versus 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 (in thousands) Research Development $ 160,493 $ 179,217 $ 227,248 (10.4 %) (21.1 %) Percent of total revenue 21.3 % 19.0 % 15.0 % The reduction in absolute dollars in fiscal 2003, compared to fiscal 2002, illustrates ongoing efforts to focus expenditures primarily on the development of critical next generation products. Spending in fiscal 2003 decreased compared to fiscal 2002 and included a reduction in employee related expenses and supplies expenses of approximately $6 million, and lower infrastructure costs, principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another $6 million. Additionally, RD expenses in fiscal 2002 of approximately $5 million related to impairment charges and write downs in the value of selected laboratory equipment, which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes. The increase in RD expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal 2003. The decrease in RD expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 results from alignment of spending on general RD programs with the downturn in the business cycle. Approximately, 60% of fiscal 2003 systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years. We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in engineering and technology development. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs, which will result in sizeable levels of investment in next generation products and enhancement of existing products. Selling, General and Administrative Percent Change Year Ended 2003 2002 June 29, June 30, June 24, versus versus 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 (in thousands) Selling General Administrative $ 132,820 $ 161,860 $ 218,919 (17.9 %) (26.1 %) Percent of total revenue 17.6 % 17.2 % 14.4 % The reduction in Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) expenses in fiscal 2003, compared to the prior year, reflects the structural change in the targeted administrative functions that have been outsourced. Reduced salaries and benefits and supply costs have been significantly substituted with variable, largely transaction based pricing from selected providers. 19 Table of Contents Infrastructure rationalization, including reduced facilities, has contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. In addition, SGA expenses in fiscal 2002 included a $4.2 million impairment charge related to the write down in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities, which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes. In the quarter ended December 29, 2002, we modified the contractual life of and added additional vesting requirements to one of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officers stock option awards. As a result of the modification, we recorded deferred stock based compensation of $3.4 million, which is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the modified options, or 16 quarters. As of June 29, 2003, approximately $2.8 million remained in deferred compensation within stockholders equity. As modified, the option award provided for accelerated vesting triggered when the Nasdaq National Market closing price of our common stock reaches or exceeds $20.00 per share. At such time when vesting is accelerated, all unvested shares will immediately vest and become exercisable, and all remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within SGA. In the quarter ended September 2003 we modified the vesting requirements to this same option award by adding a second condition to the accelerated vesting provision. Refer to the subsequent event discussion included in this Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The decrease in absolute dollars of SGA expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was largely due to manpower reductions, lower incentive payments to employees, shutdown days, and other cost reduction programs in response to the contraction in our levels of revenue. The increase in SGA expenses as a percentage of revenue for the same periods comparison was primarily the result of lower sales volume in fiscal 2002. Restructuring Charges We have developed and implemented restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels. The frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular. These dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses, including those activities within our restructuring plans, based on the best information and industry expert forecasts available at that point in time. Although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan, the extreme nature of our industrys business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective. The implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods. We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. 20 Table of Contents During fiscal 2003, we incurred $14.9 million of restructuring charges, net, associated with our fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 restructuring plans. As of June 29, 2003, the remaining restructuring reserve consisted of approximately $11.0 million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal 2003 and approximately $8.3 million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Activities We have developed programs and incurred restructuring charges in response to the depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry. This situation has caused us to evaluate our revenue outlook and forecasts, employment levels, facilities utilization and outsourcing activities and the impact on manufacturing and administrative facilities. Based on these evaluations, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan), and December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan). Prior to the end of the June 29, 2003, March 30, 2003, and December 29, 2002 quarters, management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective Plans and communicated the severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefits. None of the severance payments were contingent on employees future service to the Company. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges are based on managements estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. We applied the accounting provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (FAS 146) to the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities as we early adopted FAS 146 during the December 2002 quarter. Under the provisions of FAS 146, the restructuring charges for the remaining contractual lease payments, computed as the present value of remaining contractual payments less estimated sublease income, on vacated facilities were recognized in the quarter in which the Company ceased to use the facility. As a result of the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities, we expect quarterly savings in total expenses of approximately $1.0 million from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March 2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December 2002 Plan. These estimated savings from the Plans discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from anticipated savings, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 29, 2003, we believe actual savings are largely consistent with estimated savings. However, other activities and factors may significantly 21 Table of Contents influence our future cost structure and may offset savings from the Plans. June 2003 Plan During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced our workforce in North America, and Europe by approximately 30 people and vacated selected sales and office facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia determined to be no longer critical to our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with approximately 80% from North America and approximately 20% from our European locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $7.6 million, consisting of $0.8 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $5.7 million of charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, a $1.0 million loss on the fair value of a vacated facility, and $0.2 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements. In June 2003, two lease agreements covering four properties were amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure. One of the transferred leases covered one of our vacated facilities at our Fremont, California campus. At the time of the amendment, the leased facilitys fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1.0 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $6.7 million facility related restructuring charge. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2003 Plan: Severance Abandoned And Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) June 2003 provision $ 783 $ 6,656 $ 210 $ 7,649 Cash payments (366 ) (388 ) (754 ) Non cash charges (210 ) (210 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 $ 417 $ 6,268 $ $ 6,685 The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.4 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of $6.3 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2008. March 2003 Plan During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced our workforce in North America and Europe by approximately 50 people and vacated selected sales and office facilities located in North America determined to be no longer critical to our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $4.7 million, consisting of $1.6 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $2.9 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and $0.2 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements. 22 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the March 2003 Plan: Lease Severance Payments Abandoned And On Vacated Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) March 2003 provision $ 1,658 $ 2,913 $ 171 $ 4,742 Cash payments (855 ) (757 ) (1,612 ) Non cash charges (228 ) (171 ) (399 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 $ 575 $ 2,156 $ $ 2,731 The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.6 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of $2.2 million as of June 29, 2003 is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2007. December 2002 Plan During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 120 employees and vacated selected sales and office facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia determined to be no longer critical to our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company with approximately 65% from North America and approximately 35% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $5.7 million, consisting of $3.3 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $1.9 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and $0.5 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2002 Plan: Lease Severance Payments Abandoned And On Vacated Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) December 2002 provision $ 3,257 $ 1,945 $ 474 $ 5,676 Cash payments (3,112 ) (487 ) (3,599 ) Non cash charges (49 ) (474 ) (523 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 $ 145 $ 1,409 $ $ 1,554 The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.1 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of $1.4 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of calendar year 2004. Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Activities In response to the deterioration in semiconductor sales in the first half of fiscal 2002, which resulted in a contraction in outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and, therefore, in our revenues, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of the December 30, 2001 and September 23, 2001 23 Table of Contents quarters, management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific actions of the respective Plans and communicated the severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefits. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plans of restructuring were announced. Lease payments on vacated facilities are based on managements estimates using prevailing real estate market conditions. We initially estimated under the plans that, given prevailing real estate market conditions at that time, it would take approximately 24 months to sublease our vacated facilities. We revised the original estimates for lease payments on vacated facilities if prevailing real estate market conditions were different than the initial estimate. Leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets relating to the vacated buildings were written off as these items have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. December 2001 Plan During the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we began implementing restructuring activities that included reducing our workforce by approximately 470 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia, vacating selected office and warehouse facilities at our Fremont, California campus determined to be no longer critical to our operations, and the closure of certain offices in Asia. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company with approximately 80% from North America and approximately 20% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $33.8 million, consisting of $14.2 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $9.6 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and $9.9 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets. During fiscal 2003, we recovered approximately $3.8 million of restructuring charges originally accrued under the December 2001 Plan, $2.1 million for benefits and services that were not utilized by the terminated employees, and $1.7 million related to a revision to the net amount of lease payments remaining to be paid on the vacated facilities. In addition, during fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of additional restructuring charges of which $2.5 million was due to revisions we made for the length of time required to sublease two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California that were included in the December 2001 Plan and approximately $0.1 million due to additional facility restoration costs incurred to fulfill our contractual obligations under the terms of a lease agreement. Additionally, we revised our estimates related to employee termination costs and recorded $0.4 million of additional employee termination costs. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2001 Plan: Lease Severance Payments Abandoned And On Vacated Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) December 2001 provision $ 14,208 $ 9,637 $ 9,928 $ 33,773 Cash payments (9,122 ) (386 ) (9,508 ) Non cash charges (1,529 ) (127 ) (9,928 ) (11,584 ) Balance at June 30, 2002 3,557 9,124 12,681 Recovery of assets 18 18 Cash payments (1,773 ) (2,482 ) (4,255 ) Reversal of restructuring charges (2,118 ) (1,704 ) (18 ) (3,840 ) Additional restructuring charges 390 2,604 2,994 Balance at June 29, 2003 $ 56 $ 7,542 $ $ 7,598 24 Table of Contents The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of $7.5 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2008. September 2001 Plan During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we began implementing restructuring activities which included a reduction of approximately 550 employees in North America, Europe and Asia, vacating selected facilities at our headquarters in Fremont, California determined to be no longer critical to our operations and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with approximately 85% from North America and 15% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $21.0 million consisting of $10.8 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $1.7 million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, $7.6 million for discontinued inventory charges related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines and $0.9 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, we recovered approximately $1.7 million from unanticipated subsequent sales to our installed base of customers of certain portions of the inventory. In addition, in fiscal 2003 and 2002, we physically disposed of approximately $2.7 million of this inventory. We plan to disposition the remaining quantities of this discontinued, obsolete inventory by the end of the 2003 calendar year. During fiscal 2002, we also recovered approximately $1.0 million of the September 2001 Plan charge due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than estimated expenses relating to a vacated facility lease of $0.3 million. During fiscal 2003, approximately $0.9 million was recovered due to $0.6 million of lower than previously estimated employee severance and termination costs and $0.3 million was recovered due to actual expenses being lower than estimated for vacated facility leases. In addition, during fiscal 2003, we recorded additional charges for the September 2001 Plan based on a revision of our estimate of the length of time required to sublease one of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. Based on prevailing market conditions, we extended the accrual for lease payments to the end of the lease in June 2004 and recorded an additional $0.6 million relating to these remaining lease payments. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2001 Plan: 25 Table of Contents Lease Severance Payments Abandoned And On Vacated Fixed Discontinued Benefits Facilities Assets Inventory Total (in thousands) September 2001 provision $ 10,767 $ 1,746 $ 935 $ 7,600 $ 21,048 Recovery of assets 785 785 Cash payments (8,135 ) (762 ) (8,897 ) Non cash charges (1,035 ) (935 ) (7,600 ) (9,570 ) Reversal of restructuring charges (695 ) (317 ) (785 ) (1,797 ) Balance at June 30, 2002 902 667 1,569 Recovery of assets 933 933 Cash payments (159 ) (524 ) (683 ) Reversal of restructuring charges (572 ) (286 ) (933 ) (1,791 ) Additional restructuring charges 636 636 Balance at June 29, 2003 $ 171 $ 493 $ $ $ 664 The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.2 million, as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of $0.5 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Activities During the quarter ended December 29, 2002, we completed the restructuring activities associated with the June 2001 Plan. An additional $1.1 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. Purchased Technology for Research Development During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we made an equity investment in and purchased a portfolio of CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh. We recognized a one time charge to income of $8.0 million for the purchase of in process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million investment in preferred stock and intangible assets. Our equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of Strasbaughs total capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method, and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five years. Based on our analysis of Strasbaughs current and expected financial performance, we determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an other than temporary impairment and recorded a $2.0 million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Our equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 was ($0.8) million, ($0.8) million and $0.7 million, respectively. The income (loss) has not been material, and, therefore, has been included in other income, net, but not presented as a separate caption on the accompanying statements of operations. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, was ($10.3) million, ($8.2) million and $15.1 million in fiscal year 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The change in net other expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to Lam stock and lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower interest expense due to the redemption of our 5% $300 million subordinated 26 Table of Contents debentures in September 2002. The increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by the non taxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to Lam stock, and smaller foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances. On August 23, 2002, we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts by purchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of Lam common stock at an average price of $11.19 per share for a total cash payment of $39.1 million. By settling the equity derivative contracts, we were able to repurchase the shares recording a life to date gain of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) from their then market value. Resulting from this transaction, we recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million. Based on the $13.60 market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million, from their June 30, 2002 fair value of $24.8 million. This $16.4 million reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value was recorded as a non taxable loss in other expense in fiscal 2003. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our annual income tax expense (benefit) was ($7.9) million, ($37.9) million, and $60.5 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The gains and losses in fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001 resulting from the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock were non taxable. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to RD tax credits resulting in our recording a $24.9 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the longer term, limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide, was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world, with our expectations of the level, timing, and sources of future revenues and profits. In fiscal 2002, we recorded an income tax benefit of $37.9 million related to net losses incurred. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we increased our tax benefit rate to 30%. The increase resulted from the tax benefit of the RD credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for RD tax benefits. For fiscal year 2001, we recorded an income tax expense of $60.5 million, which was 30% of income before taxes. Deferred Tax Assets We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $287.5 million and $290.4 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $36.7 million and $52.2 million and deferred tax liabilities of $30.7 million and $26.7 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Outsourcing We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities. We have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products, to market and sell what we develop, and to service and 27 Table of Contents support directly what we sell. Most other activities in the Company are in support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties. Accordingly, during fiscal 2002, we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities management and information technology functions. During fiscal 2003, we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business. Related Party Transactions During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with Lam entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars at 6.75% simple interest. At June 29, 2003, the entire principal amount, $1.0 million, and accrued interest was outstanding. The loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable, in full, together with accrued interest, at any time, but no later than May 8, 2005. Subsequent Events During the quarter ending September 2003, we added a second condition to the accelerated vesting provision contained in one of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officers stock option awards that was previously modified in the December 2002 quarter. When and if the vesting of the award is accelerated, all unvested shares shall immediately become fully vested and exercisable, and any remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within SGA. The award now provides for accelerated vesting when each of the following conditions is met: (1) the Nasdaq national market closing price of Lam common stock reaches or exceeds $20.00 per share, and (2) applying U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, Lams fiscal quarter net income exceeds $2.5 million after deducting any incremental amortization expense that results from acceleration of these same options. The two conditions need not be met simultaneously nor in a specific order. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant 28 Table of Contents judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications. Revenue related to sales of spare parts, system upgrade kits, and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of performance of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SAB 101. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual cost on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers, we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products unless other customer practices prevail. Standard costs are generally re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from 29 Table of Contents system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known differences such as tool reliability improvements. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. Historically, including the most recent 12 months ended June 29, 2003, all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans: We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 (FIN 44) and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (FAS 148), which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123). Our ESPP is a non compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Because our stock based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock based awards to employees. Deferred Income Taxes: We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $36.7 million covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits. When the stock option tax benefits are realized, a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. When the foreign tax credits are realized, the remaining portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed through the tax provision (benefit) in the statement of operations as a reduction of income tax expense. 30 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities: In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 146. FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) (EITF 94 3). The principal difference between FAS 146 and EITF 94 3 relates to FAS 146s requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94 3 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. We early adopted FAS 146 in the quarter ended December 29, 2002 and applied its accounting provisions to the restructuring activities initiated during the quarters ended December 29, 2002, March 30, 2003 and June 29, 2003 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Form 10 K). No restructuring activities were initiated during the quarter ended September 29, 2002. Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables: In November 2002, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21). EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables (products, services and or rights to use assets). The provisions of EITF 00 21 will be applicable for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 is not currently anticipated to have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations. Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others: In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also requires the guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 also incorporates, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34, Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others which is superseded by FIN 45. FIN 45s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The provisions of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. (See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Form 10 K). Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure: In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (FAS 148), which amends FAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 and requires prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on a companys financial position and results of operations. The transition guidance and annual 31 Table of Contents disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the interim disclosure requirements of FAS 148 for financial statements in our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2003. We intend to continue to account for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan under the provisions of APB 25 and FIN 44. Accordingly, the adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities: In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. FIN 46 establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE), sometimes formerly referred to as a special purpose entity. In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46 applies to any business enterprise, both public and private, that has a controlling interest, contractual relationship, or other business relationship with a VIE. FIN 46 provides guidance for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a VIE, that functions to support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. FIN 46 will require the consolidation of a VIE by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIEs activities or entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns or both. The effective date of the new rules under FIN 46 on our existing operating leases was immediate on any new leases entered into after January 31, 2003, which utilize VIEs or equivalent lease structures and otherwise effective the first quarter of fiscal 2004. FIN 46 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations because we have transferred certain of our operating lease agreements to a new lessor that does not qualify as a VIE (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Form 10 K). Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (FAS 149). FAS 149 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133) for decisions made as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) and changes financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. Specifically, FAS 149 (1) clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in FAS 133, (2) clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that requires reporting as cash flows from financing activities in the statement of cash flows, and (3) amends the definition of an underlying"(to include a variable such as the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event) to correspond to the language in FIN 45. These changes will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that require separate accounting. FAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. However, the provisions of FAS 149 that codify the previous decisions made by the DIG are already effective and should continue to be applied in accordance with their prior respective effective dates. The adoption of FAS 149 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity: In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and 32 Table of Contents Equity, (FAS 150). FAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. FAS 150 represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs. FAS 150 generally requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial instruments: (1) Instruments that represent, or indexed to, an obligation to buy back the issuers shares, regardless of whether the instrument is settled on a net cash or gross physical basis, (2) Obligations that can be settled in shares but meet one of the following conditions: (a) derive their value predominately from some other underlying, or (b) have a fixed value, or have a value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite direction as the issuers shares. Many of the instruments within the scope of FAS 150 were previously classified by the issuer as equity or temporary equity. FAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The adoption of FAS 150 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, consignment materials and outsourcing agreements. In addition, our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships for which we have an obligation under certain guarantee contracts. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: Debt and Other Long term Operating Purchase Liabilities Leases Obligations (in thousands) Fiscal years ended: Through June 27, 2004 $ 5,011 $ 15,349 $ 35,760 2005 through 2007 332,144 28,626 40,771 2008 through 2010 65 101,856 10,419 Thereafter 309 Total $ 337,220 $ 146,140 $ 86,950 Debt and Other Long Term Liabilities Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included in this Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information concerning our debt and other long term liabilities. Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, RD and operating facilities, regional sales/services offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10 K, for further information concerning our operating leases. In March 2003, a lease agreement (the Agreement) relating to two properties (land and buildings) at our Fremont, California campus was transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated. The Agreement replaces the former lease that was due to expire in March 2003. As 33 Table of Contents part of the Agreement, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for approximately $54.4 million. In addition, we are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $48.4 million at the end of the lease term in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the lease is not renewed, we do not exercise our purchase option, and the lessor sells the property and the sale price is less than the lessors cost). We maintain cash collateral of $54.4 million as of June 29, 2003 in separate specified interest bearing accounts. The lessor is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a VIE as defined by FIN 46, and, therefore, we do not consolidate its operations. In June 2003, two lease agreements relating to four properties (land and buildings) at our Fremont, California campus were transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated (the Lease Agreement). In connection with this transaction, the leases were combined and transferred from the existing lessors to a new lessor, under a single lease structure. As part of the Lease Agreement, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for approximately $58.0 million. In addition, the Lease Agreement requires that we guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $50.3 million at the end of the lease term in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the lease is not renewed, we do not exercise our purchase option, and the lessor sells the property and the sale price is less than the lessors cost). Additionally, as part of the Lease Agreement, we maintain cash collateral of approximately $58.0 million in separate specified interest bearing accounts. The lessor is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a VIE as defined by FIN 46, and, therefore, we do not consolidate its operations. Purchase Obligations During the second half of fiscal 2002, we began to enter into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, and information technology functions. During fiscal 2003, we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional, general and administrative functions. We believe that these outsourced services will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the potential assumption of leases, assets and employees. Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form for additional information. We have certain guaranteed purchase agreements in place that contractually obligate us to purchase a minimum amount of materials related to the manufacturing of our products. At June 29, 2003, our outstanding purchase obligation for these agreements was approximately $10.5 million. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as inventory until title is transferred to us, or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 29, 2003, vendor owned inventories held at Lam and not reported as inventory were approximately $6.4 million. Guarantees The transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our Fremont, California campus and discussed above under Operating Leases require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to $98.7 million. The terms of these guarantees, five years, are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements. Under the accounting provisions of FIN 45, we recognized a liability of approximately $1.0 million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases. This liability, determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over 34 Table of Contents the term of the guarantees, was recorded as prepaid rent, with the offset recorded as a liability, and the amount is being amortized to rent expense (for the prepaid rent) and to income (for the liability) on a ratable basis over the five year period of the leases. Refer to Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10 K, for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under certain of our operating lease agreements, such as, indemnification for certain environmental matters. We have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2003, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We have agreements with two financial institutions where our U.S. operating company guarantees payment of our Japanese subsidiarys overdraft protection obligation. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at June 29, 2003, is approximately $5.2 million, the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement. As of June 29, 2003, our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement. We have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. Dollar denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems, subject to recourse provisions. We insure these sold receivables for approximately 90% of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied. Based on historical payment patterns, we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore, believe the risk of loss from default is minimal. The terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past the due date of the receivable, until collected. At June 29, 2003, the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is approximately $2.8 million. As of June 29, 2003, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify our customers, under pre determined conditions and limitations, for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. See Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10K, for discussion relating to our product warranty reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 29, 2003, we had $625.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash compared with $945.2 million at June 30, 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.2 million in fiscal 2003, which consists of a net loss for the year of $7.7 million, adjusted for non cash charges of $70.3 million and sources of working capital of $6.6 million. Non cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in our stock. 35 Table of Contents Significant changes in current assets and liabilities include a $23.7 million improvement in accounts receivable resulting from continued improvement in accounts receivable turnover. Additionally, our outsourcing strategy and asset management efforts contributed to reduction of inventory levels of approximately $63.5 million. Trade payables declined by $24.3 million due to reduced spending resulting from our cost containment activities and lower inventory purchases. Accrued liabilities declined by $34.9 million due in part to tax payments and lower interest payable resulting from the redemption of our 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell $18.4 million, due to lower rates of shipments and the reduced cycle time in customer acceptances. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2003 was $296.4 million. We sold $355.5 million, net, of short term investments that were primarily used to repay our 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes (5% Notes) in September 2002. Net capital expenditures were $12.3 million, and our restricted cash increased $47.5 million primarily due to increased cash collateralization requirements under certain of our operating lease agreements. Net property and equipment was $48.8 million at June 29, 2003, compared to $67.5 million at June 30, 2002. The decrease in property and equipment in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to minimized expenditures for capital projects during fiscal 2003 and write offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities. Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was $373.3 million and consisted primarily of the repayment of our 5% Notes in the amount of $309.8 million and repayment of our Japanese subsidiarys long term loan for approximately $51.1 million. In connection with the settlement of our equity derivative contract, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock for $39.1 million. We also reissued $12.5 million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program. Net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled $14.7 million. During fiscal 2003, we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts that were recorded in other short term assets. Based on the market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair value of the equity derivative contracts decreased by $16.4 million to $8.4 million from their June 30, 2002 fair value of $24.8 million. Currently outstanding debt obligations primarily consist of our 4% Notes. Details of the 4% Notes are: Offering Date May 2001 Offering Amount $300.0 million Maturity Date June 1, 2006 Offering Expenses $8.5 million incurred at the time of offering, ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the 4% Notes. Remaining unamortized balance of $5.0 million and $6.7 million at June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, respectively. Interest Rate terms 4% payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2001 Conversion Rights Convertible into Lam Common Stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a 36 Table of Contents conversion price of $44.93 per share subject to anti dilution adjustments Redemption Terms Redeemable at Lams option, beginning June 5, 2004 with at least 20 days and no more than 60 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest Security 4% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of Lam. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the swap) with a notional amount of $300 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The transaction swapped 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), resulting in interest expense savings of approximately $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2003. Should 6 month LIBOR interest rates rise above approximately 5% per annum in future periods, we would incur incremental interest expense. Under the terms of the transaction, we must provide collateral to match any unfavorable mark to market exposure (fair value) on the swap. The amount of collateral required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus an amount equal to the unfavorable mark to market exposure (fair value) on the swap. Therefore, the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark to market exposure (fair value) on the swap instrument. Generally, the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise. At the end of fiscal 2003, we have posted $6.0 million of collateral under this swap agreement which is included in restricted cash on our balance sheet (classified as a long term asset). We have designated this swap as a fair value hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million over a three year period). These payments began in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. As of June 29, 2003, a total amount of $12.5 million had been paid to Varian, which included the initial $5.0 million in December 2001 and six additional quarterly installment payments of $1.25 million each, totaling $7.5 million as of June 29, 2003. The total obligation remaining as of June 29, 2003 is $7.5 million, which will be paid through December 2004. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in RD and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 29, 2003, combined with cash conservation activities, are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products. 37 Table of Contents Risk Factors Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically; the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; timing of customer acceptances of equipment; the size and timing of orders from customers; customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations, and or acceptances; changes in average selling prices and product mix; our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; our competitors introduction of new products; legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; changes in import/export regulations; transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as Acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural disasters; legislative, tax, or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation; procurement shortages; manufacturing difficulties; the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations; new or modified accounting regulations; exchange rate fluctuations; and exposure on interest rate swap agreements. 38 Table of Contents Further, because a significant amount of our RD and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California, facility, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High Priced Systems System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can range in price from approximately $400,000 to $4 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter. Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. During calendar year 2001 and the first half of calendar year 2002, semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity. The resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. The semiconductor industry is experiencing a continued and prolonged downturn, and as of the end of fiscal 2003, our customers continue to remain cautious about their levels of capital expenditures. Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and have new products manufactured successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our 39 Table of Contents failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in RD and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict or prepare for. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers. We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers. However, several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect 40 Table of Contents We are expanding the roles that outsource providers play in our business. We anticipate that these outsource providers will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expanded role of outsource providers has and will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and or have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitors Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitors Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular suppliers processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors equipment. We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process RD. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Our Future Success Depends on International Sales Non U.S. sales accounted for approximately 72% of our total revenue in fiscal 2003, 71% in fiscal 2002, and 70% in fiscal 2001. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. International sales are subject to risks, including, but not limited to: foreign exchange risks; changing import/export requirements; foreign trade disputes; and economic, political, banking and currency problems in the relevant region. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen denominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future. A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May Be Impaired The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training, managing, and appropriately sizing our work force. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth. If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of 42 Table of Contents complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and or the price of our Common Stock. The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; global economic fluctuations; variations in our quarterly operating results; variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast; announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations, or introduction of new products; government regulations; developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or political, economic, or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert a managements attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the 43 Table of Contents price for our Common Stock. We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and email. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. We have security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, that are believed to be adequate to cover the outlined risks; however, our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. Risk Associated with Our Interest Rate Swap Agreement We aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations. To minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4% convertible subordinated notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300 million. We entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate. If 6 month LIBOR based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings. However, a rise in 6 month LIBOR based interest rates above approximately 5% per annum in future periods would result in incremental levels of interest expense. The Potential Anti Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We Have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the Rights Plan) in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals. Our Rights Plan may have certain anti takeover effects. Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders, as defined by that statute. Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other 44 Table of Contents parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio, long term assets and long term debt obligations at June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002: 45 Table of Contents June 29, June 30, 2003 2002 There Fair 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After Total Value Total ($ in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate $ 119,805 $ $ $ $ $ $ 119,805 $ 119,805 $ 145,700 Average rate 1.14 % $ 1.14 % 1.87 % Short term investments Fixed rate $ 90,304 $ 104,852 21,773 $ 11,562 $ 4,227 $ $ 232,718 $ 233,884 $ 499,225 Average rate 2.76 % 1.81 % 1.75 % 2.15 % 2.16 % $ 2.20 % 4.04 % Auction rate preferreds Variable rate $ 98,919 $ 7,267 $ $ $ $ $ 106,186 $ 106,186 $ 202,549 Average rate 1.49 % 1.32 % 1.48 % 2.13 % Restricted cash Fixed rate $ 118,468 $ $ $ $ $ $ 118,468 $ 118,468 $ 70,983 Average rate 1.06 % 1.06 % 2.52 % Total investment Securities $ 427,496 $ 112,119 $ 21,773 $ 11,562 $ 4,227 $ $ 577,177 $ 578,343 $ 918,457 Average rate 1.54 % 1.78 % 1.75 % 2.15 % 2.16 % 1.61 % 3.15 % Long term debt Fixed rate $ $ $ 300,000 $ $ $ $ 300,000 $ 292,841 $ 610,260 Average rate 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.51 % Variable rate $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 48,535 Average rate 2.61 % Total long term debt $ $ $ 300,000 $ $ $ $ 300,000 $ 292,841 $ 658,795 Average rate 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.37 % We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We have no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate $300.0 million convertible subordinated notes. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Japanese Yen denominated assets. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. On June 29, 2003, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $2.2 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 29, 2003, was $0.1 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $0.4 million, while depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $0.3 million. On June 29, 2003, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $16.4 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 29, 2003, was $0.3 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $2.9 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of 46 Table of Contents approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $2.1 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300.0 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Companys 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on LIBOR. At June 29, 2003, the fair value of the swap, $19.2 million, was recorded in other long term assets. An increase in rates by 1% would result in a decline in the fair value of the swap of $7.7 million. A decrease in rates by 1% would result in an increase in the fair value of the swap of $9.0 million.
