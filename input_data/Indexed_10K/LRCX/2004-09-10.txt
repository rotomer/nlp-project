Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the worlds semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product offerings that include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, wafer cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over the past three business cycles, the severity of these fluctuations has increased, and todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Strengthening demand that we had noted early in fiscal 2004 and our belief that we are gaining market share manifested themselves in the progression of our quarterly revenues. We have continued to focus on our systems and service competitiveness and the implementation of strategies aimed at achieving a more variable cost structure. These efforts, combined with higher volumes, are illustrated by gross margin improvements year over year, including both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we decided to cease further investment in CMP systems development. This decision was based on the conclusion that the product did not demonstrate sufficient advantages to garner the market share necessary for adequate returns on further investment. Also during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we repaid in full our convertible subordinated 4% notes (4% Notes), two years prior to maturity, and we settled our interest rate swap agreement (the swap) which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our fixed rate 4% Notes. 15 Table of Contents We continue to invest significantly in research and development to strengthen our product and service offerings and competitive position. Increases in operating expenses during fiscal 2004 were primarily due to a growth in salary and benefits costs, a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive based benefits triggered by higher profits. In addition, spending increased during fiscal 2004 for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. These costs have been partially offset by a decrease in facilities related expenses as a result of infrastructure rationalization and consolidation. Total Revenue Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands) Revenue $ 935,946 $ 755,234 $ 943,114 23.9 % (19.9 %) The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2004 compared to the prior year is reflective of a market environment that has improved, evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. Signs of improvement in demand for wafer processing equipment, noted early in 2004, continued through the year. These improvements in demand as well as our belief of market share gains are evidenced by the progression of our quarterly revenues. The overall increase in our revenues is influenced by increased demand, system installation cycles and customer acceptances. Our current estimate for revenues for the September 2004 quarter is approximately $400 to $415 million. The decrease in revenue for fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 reflected our customers response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry, which was significantly influenced by the retrenchment of the global economy and levels of end user demand for products servicing telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics markets. Semiconductor manufacturers selectively invested in leading edge technology equipment through fiscal 2003. Overall, demand remained relatively flat during fiscal 2003. Based on the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition, we generally recognize new systems revenue when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Refer to our discussion of Critical Accounting Policies within this document for additional information about our revenue recognition policy. Where customer acceptance provisions exist, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is typically determined based on the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications. In accordance with SAB 104, in situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. On average, revenue recognition for systems normally occurs from two to five months after the date of shipment. Spares and system upgrade revenues are generally recognized on the date of shipment, and service revenues are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customer, including training and extended warranty support. 16 Table of Contents Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 27, June 29, June 30, 2004 2003 2002 North America 18 % 28 % 29 % Europe 19 % 20 % 21 % Asia Pacific 52 % 44 % 35 % Japan 11 % 8 % 15 % The Asia Pacific region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is located within this region; this trend has continued. The growth in Asia Pacific revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in Taiwan and Singapore. The fiscal 2003 increase in Asia Pacific revenues reflected expanded foundry capabilities and investments by certain of our customers to support the introduction of latest generation integrated circuit manufacturing. Gross Margin Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 431,049 $ 303,829 $ 266,089 41.9 % 14.2 % Percent of total revenue 46.1 % 40.2 % 28.2 % We have continued to focus on systems design to achieve more efficient purchasing and installation processes. Our performance is evidenced by six successive quarters progression of gross margin as a percent of total revenues. The increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of approximately six percentage points in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources, expense management programs, and improved sales volumes throughout the year. Fiscal 2004 gross margin includes $2.4 million of asset impairment charges related to our discontinuance of work on CMP systems development as discussed earlier in the introductory paragraph within Results of Operations in this section. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we recovered and recorded, in cost of goods sold, $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, from unanticipated sales of certain inventories previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring. We expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 50% during the September 2004 quarter. The primary objectives of our strategy to outsource manufacturing activities included a plan to avoid future fixed cost infrastructure and to achieve a more variable cost structure, by establishing transaction based pricing agreements with vendors. In addition, we have realized opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base. Our restructuring plans, combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing and customer support operations, also contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the two most recent fiscal years. The manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes. One objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles. In this context, we had incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of $24.1 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and $5.9 million of inventory restructuring expenses. The charges in fiscal 2002 reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time. The reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal 2003 reflects more stability in 17 Table of Contents quarter on quarter business levels during the year and our continued emphasis on the minimization of costs discussed above. Approximately 5 percentage points of year over year improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2003 reflects the $38.8 million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2002. In the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian). We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash and issued them a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $21.5 million. In connection with this settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8 million in fiscal 2002, and the remaining amount of the settlement, $2.7 million, represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received. The $2.7 million relating to the license was amortized ratably over the subsequent 10 quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold. The $2.7 million license was fully amortized at June 27, 2004. Research and Development Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands, except percentages) Research Development $ 170,479 $ 160,493 $ 179,217 6.2 % (10.4 %) Percent of total revenue 18.2 % 21.3 % 19.0 % To better position ourselves competitively, we continue to invest significantly in research and development aiming at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of next generation products as well as enhancement of our existing offerings. Approximately 65% of fiscal 2004 systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The decrease in expenses as a percent of total revenues is due to increased sales volumes as our fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was nearly four times our RD expense growth rate. The growth in spending between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $10 million, a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive based benefits triggered by higher profits. Approximately $2 million of the overall increase occurred throughout several categories and was due primarily to the increase in business activity. These costs were partially offset by reductions in facilities related expenses, largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly $2 million, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation. We do not expect that our decision to cease further investment in CMP systems development will have a significant impact on future RD expense levels. Spending in fiscal 2003 decreased compared to fiscal 2002 and included a reduction in employee related expenses and supplies expenses of approximately $6 million, and lower infrastructure costs, principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another $6 million. Fiscal 2002 expenses included approximately $5 million related to impairment charges and write downs in the value of selected laboratory equipment, which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes. The increase in RD expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal 2003. 18 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended Percent Change 2004 2003 June 27, June 29, June 30, versus versus 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General Administrative (SGA) $ 146,063 $ 132,820 $ 161,860 10.0 % (17.9 %) Percent of total revenue 15.6 % 17.6 % 17.2 % Significant increases in profits during fiscal 2004 supported the Company increasing employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 by nearly $12 million; a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive based benefits triggered by higher profits. Also contributing to the fiscal 2004 SGA expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately $5 million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. A decrease of approximately $4 million, primarily in depreciation expense, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above. Infrastructure rationalization and consolidation, including reduced facilities, contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. In addition, SGA expenses in fiscal 2002 included a $4.2 million impairment charge related to the write down in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities, which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes. We expect total operating expenses will be approximately $95 million during the September 2004 quarter. Restructuring Charges We have developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and, at times, depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry. The frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular. These dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses, including those activities within our restructuring plans, based on the best information and industry expert forecasts available at that point in time. Although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan, the extreme nature of our industrys business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective. The implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods. We systematically review our revenue outlook and forecasts and assess their impact on required employment levels, facilities utilization, and outsourcing activities. Based on these evaluations, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended March 28, 2004 (the March 2004 Plan), December 28, 2003 (the December 2003 Plan), September 28, 2003 (the September 2003 Plan), June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan), December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan), December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective Plan. Severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on managements estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities 19 Table of Contents have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. As of June 27, 2004, the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Fiscal 2004 restructurings $ 30 $ 2,077 $ 2,107 Fiscal 2003 restructurings 183 6,451 6,634 Fiscal 2002 restructurings 389 3,496 3,885 Pre fiscal 2002 restructurings 1,228 1,228 Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 602 $ 13,252 $ 13,854 The severance and benefits related costs are anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2005. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2010. Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Activities We recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately $6.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $1.2 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $2.8 million, and the write off of related leasehold improvements of $1.6 million. We also recorded a charge of approximately $1.0 million for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Japan and $2.1 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements. Furthermore, we recognized $1.9 million of additional facilities related expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal 2004. Charges during the year were partially offset by recovery of $1.5 million, net, of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in Japan. Additional offsetting items include recovery of $0.7 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and $1.7 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring. The inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold. As a result of the fiscal 2004 restructuring activities, we expect quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of approximately $0.3 million from the March 2004 Plan, $0.7 million from the December 2003 Plan and $0.5 million from the September 2003 Plan. The majority of the savings are expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings from the Plans discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 27, 2004, we believe actual savings from these Plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings. March 2004 Plan We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended March 28, 2004 of approximately $3.0 million, consisting of charges for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Japan, deemed to be no longer useful to our operations, of $1.0 million, and the write off of related leasehold improvements of $2.0 million. 20 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the March 2004 Plan: Abandoned Fixed Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) March 2004 provision $ 950 $ 2,088 $ 3,038 Cash payments (950 ) (950 ) Non cash charges (2,088 ) (2,088 ) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ $ $ December 2003 Plan Our December 2003 Plan activities included reducing our workforce by less than 20 employees, primarily in North America and by vacating a facility located in North America deemed to be no longer useful to our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a range of functions and at different levels of the organization. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended December 28, 2003 of approximately $4.2 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write off of related leasehold improvements.

The employees included in the Plan were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended September 28, 2003 of approximately $1.2 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write off of associated leasehold improvements. 21 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2003 Plan: Severance Abandoned and Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) September 2003 provision $ 713 $ 394 $ 123 $ 1,230 Additional restructuring charges 48 48 Reversal of restructuring charges (69 ) (7 ) (76 ) Cash payments (662 ) (353 ) (1,015 ) Non cash charges (123 ) (123 ) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 30 $ 34 $ $ 64 Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Activities As a result of the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities, we expect quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, of approximately $1.0 million from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March 2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December 2002 Plan. The majority of the savings are expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings are primarily from lower payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual results may vary from those anticipated, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 27, 2004, we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts. However, other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and, consequently, partially or totally offset savings from these Plans. June 2003 Plan Our June 2003 Plan activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 30 people and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended June 29, 2003, of approximately $7.6 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write off of related leasehold improvements. In June 2003, a lease covering one of the vacated facilities at our Fremont, California campus was amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure. At the time of the amendment, the leased facilitys fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1.0 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $6.7 million facility related restructuring charge. 22 Table of Contents Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2003 Plan: Severance Abandoned and Fixed Benefits Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) June 2003 provision $ 783 $ 6,656 $ 210 $ 7,649 Cash payments (366 ) (388 ) (754 ) Non cash charges (210 ) (210 ) Balance at June 29, 2003 417 6,268 6,685 Cash payments (374 ) (847 ) (1,221 ) Reversal of restructuring charges (37 ) (2 ) (39 ) Additional restructuring charges 84 84 Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 6 $ 5,503 $ $ 5,509 March 2003 Plan Our March 2003 Plan activities included reducing our workforce in North America and Europe by approximately 50 people and by vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended March 30, 2003, of approximately $4.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write off of related leasehold improvements. We recovered $0.3 million during fiscal 2004 due to a change in estimates related to our facilities. Additionally, during fiscal 2004 $0.3 million were recovered due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs.

The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 65% from North America and approximately 35% from Europe and Asia locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of $5.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write off of related leasehold improvements. During fiscal 2004 23 Table of Contents we recovered $0.1 million due to the difference between the costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement related to a facility in Japan.

The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels throughout the organization with approximately 80% from North America and approximately 20% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets. During fiscal 2004, we recorded approximately $0.4 million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately $1.4 million, net, due to the difference between the costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during the quarter ended March 28, 2004. During fiscal 2003, we recovered approximately $3.8 million of restructuring charges originally accrued under the December 2001 Plan, $2.1 million for benefits offered that were not utilized by terminated employees and approximately $1.7 million related to a revision to the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities. In addition, during fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of additional restructuring charges of which $2.5 million were due to revisions we made in sublease assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California and approximately $0.1 million due to additional facility restoration costs. The remaining $0.4 million of expenses were due to revisions we made in our estimates for employee termination costs September 2001 Plan During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, our restructuring activities included a reduction of approximately 550 employees in North America, Europe and Asia, vacating selected facilities at our Fremont, California campus deemed to be no longer required for our operations and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 85% from North America and 15% from Europe and Asia locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of $21.0 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments and write offs of leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and inventory write downs. The inventory charge of approximately $7.6 million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems within our etch product lines. We recovered approximately $1.7 million during fiscal year 2004, $1.0 million during fiscal year 2003, and $0.7 million during fiscal year 2002, from 24 Table of Contents unanticipated subsequent sales to our installed base of these items. We physically disposed of approximately $1.0 million of this inventory during fiscal 2004 and $2.7 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002. During fiscal 2003, approximately $0.9 million was recovered due to lower employee severance and termination costs of $0.6 million and lower than planned expenses for vacated facility leases of $0.3 million. In addition, we recorded additional charges of $0.6 million for the September 2001 Plan based on a revised estimate of the length of time required to sublease one of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. During fiscal 2002, we recovered approximately $1.0 million of the September 2001 Plan charge due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than planned expenses relating to a vacated facility lease of $0.3 million. Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Plans During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan. A final $1.1 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, was $4.5 million, ($10.3) million and ($8.2) million in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and consisted of the following: Year Ended June 27, June 29, June 30, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Interest income $ 9,915 $ 15,804 $ 31,703 Loss on equity derivative contracts (16,407 ) (8,236 ) Interest expense (4,634 ) (6,096 ) (26,185 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss) (1,334 ) (272 ) 1,982 Debt issue cost amortization (1,593 ) (2,536 ) (3,763 ) Net gain on settlement of swap and retirement of 4% Notes 4,505 Equity method investment losses (426 ) (777 ) (835 ) Equity method investment impairment (2,000 ) Other, net (1,963 ) 24 (823 ) $ 4,470 $ (10,260 ) $ (8,157 ) During fiscal 2004, our total cash balances, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash, increased each quarter through March 28, 2004. These increases in cash balances allowed us to repay, in the June 2004 quarter, our 4% Notes prior to maturity as discussed below. Although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year, interest income decreased during fiscal 2004 as a result of lower market rates. The decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal 2004 is largely due to the redemption of our 5% $300.0 million subordinated debentures (5% Notes) in September 2002. During the quarter ended June 27, 2004, we repaid in full our 4% Notes, two years prior to maturity. The repayment of the 4% Notes resulted in a cash outlay of $303.0 million, which included a redemption premium of $3.0 million. Additionally, during the same quarter, we settled the related interest rate swap agreement (the swap) which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes. This settlement resulted in an increase in cash of $10.9 million and, in addition, a transfer of $6 million from restricted cash to cash balances. As a result of the repayment of the 4% Notes and swap settlement, we recorded a net gain of $4.5 million included in other income (expense), net. The $4.5 million consisted of a $10.9 million gain related to the swap less the $3.0 million redemption premium and write off of $3.4 million of unamortized offering expenses associated with the 4% Notes. 25 Table of Contents The change in net other expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to Lam stock and lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower interest expense due to the redemption of our 5% Notes in September 2002. On August 23, 2002, we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts by purchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of Lam common stock at an average price of $11.19 per share for a total cash payment of $39.1 million. The settlement generated a life to date gain of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) and we recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million as a result of this transaction. Based on the $13.60 market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million, from their June 30, 2002 fair value of $24.8 million. This $16.4 million reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value was recorded as a non taxable loss in other expense in fiscal 2003. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our annual income tax expense (benefit) was $27.7 million, ($7.9) million, and ($37.9) million, in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The losses on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 of $16.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, were non deductible for income tax purposes. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to RD tax credits resulting in our recording a $24.9 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the longer term, limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world, with our expectations of the level, timing, and sources of future revenues and profits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we increased our tax benefit rate to 30%. The increase resulted from the tax benefit of the RD credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pre tax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for RD tax benefits. Deferred Tax Assets We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $303.3 million and $287.5 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $67.8 million and $36.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of $26.3 million and $30.7 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Outsourcing We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities. We have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products, to market and sell what we develop, and to service and support directly what we sell. Most other activities in the Company are in support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties. Accordingly, during fiscal 2002, we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities management and information technology functions. During fiscal 2003 and 2004, we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that historically occurred due to the cyclical nature of our business. 26 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with Lam entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars at 6.75% simple interest. He was advanced the $1.0 million and subsequently repaid the entire amount of $1.0 million, plus accrued interest, during the quarter ended December 28, 2003. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts, system upgrade kits, and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. 27 Table of Contents Standard costs are re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor activities, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability improvements. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. Historically, including the most recent fiscal year ended June 27, 2004, all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans: We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 (FIN 44) and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS 148), which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Our ESPP is a non compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Because our stock based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded 28 Table of Contents options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion the existing option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock based awards to employees. Deferred Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $67.8 million relates to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits. When the stock option tax benefits are realized, the related deferred tax asset will reverse and a portion of the valuation allowance will also be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include long term liabilities and restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: Other Long term Restructuring Operating Purchase Liabilities Liabilities Leases Obligations Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 2,500 $ 5,093 $ 13,894 $ 108,142 $ 129,629 1 3 years 730 6,986 13,718 54,750 76,184 4 5 years 62 1,748 102,034 41,498 145,342 Over 5 years 27 388 1,825 2,240 Total $ 3,292 $ 13,854 $ 130,034 $ 206,215 $ 353,395 Other Long Term Liabilities During the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a non exclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash, $5.0 million in December 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million over a three year period. As of June 27, 2004, a total amount of $17.5 million has been paid to Varian and the total obligation remaining is $2.5 million through December 2004. 29 Table of Contents Restructuring Liabilities Our total restructuring reserves as of June 27, 2004 were $13.9 million, including $0.6 million of severance and benefits related costs and $13.3 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect $5.1 million to be paid over the next twelve months and $8.8 million to be paid between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2010. Please see the related discussion in Restructuring Charges within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, RD and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. All of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In March and June of 2003, lease agreements relating to properties at our Fremont, California campus were transferred to a new lessor, amended, combined and restated. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all properties related to these leases of approximately $112.5 million. In addition, we are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to $98.7 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, and the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). At the time of the June amendment, one of the leased propertys current fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1.0 million. The leased property was a building that had been part of our past restructuring activities, and the non cash loss was recorded as a restructuring charge during fiscal 2003. As a result, we recorded a $1.0 million liability for the loss on the leased property. We maintain cash collateral of $112.5 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 27, 2004 in separate, specified interest bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and is therefore not consolidated by us. The $98.7 million is included in the table above. The remaining $31.3 million primarily relates to non cancelable facility related operating leases expiring at various dates through 2021. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of material contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain elements, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. These outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 27, 2004 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as Lam inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 27, 2004, vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as Lam inventory were approximately $14.6 million. 30 Table of Contents Guarantees The transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our Fremont, California campus and discussed above under Operating Leases require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to $98.7 million (in the case that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). The remaining terms of these guarantees, four years, are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements. Under the accounting provisions of FIN 45, we recognized a liability of approximately $1.0 million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases. This liability, determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over the term of the guarantees, was recorded as prepaid rent, with the offset recorded as a liability, and the amount is being amortized to rent expense (for the prepaid rent) and to income (for the liability) on a ratable basis over the five year period of the leases. Refer to Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10 K, for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements, such as, indemnification for various environmental matters. We have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June 27, 2004, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We have agreements with two financial institutions where our U.S. operating company guarantees payment of our Japanese subsidiarys overdraft protection obligation. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at June 27, 2004, is approximately $5.6 million, the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement. As of June 27, 2004, our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid. We have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. Dollar denominated accounts receivable generated from the sale of our systems, subject to recourse provisions. We insure these sold receivables for approximately 90% of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied. Based on historical payment patterns, we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore, believe the risk of loss from default is minimal. The terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past the due date of the receivable, until collected. At June 27, 2004, the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is approximately $6.0 million. As of June 27, 2004, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid. Generally, we indemnify our customers, under pre determined conditions and limitations, for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We provide standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known factors such as the impact of system reliability improvements. See Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10K, for changes in our product warranty reserves during fiscal 2004. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 27, 2004, we had $541.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash compared with $625.9 million at June 29, 2003. Cash provided by operating activities of $157.1 million, issuance of common stock of $64.2 million and reissuance of treasury stock of $13.2 million resulted in net cash increases of $234.5 million which enabled us to repay early our 4% Notes, which resulted in a principal payment of $300.0 million. Additional significant uses of cash included capital expenditures of $24.0 million. On April 1, 2004, we settled our swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes. This settlement resulted in an increase in cash of $10.9 million and, in addition, a transfer of $6.0 million from restricted cash to cash balances. On June 7, 2004, we repaid our 4% Notes, two years prior to maturity. This repayment resulted in a cash outlay of $303.0 million, including a redemption premium of $3.0 million. Additionally, we wrote off $3.4 million of unamortized offering expenses. We had a deferred gain of $10.9 million recorded on the balance sheet, in long term debt and other long term liabilities, related to the swap. As a result of the settlement of the swap and the redemption of the 4% Notes, we recorded a net gain of $4.5 million included in other income, net in our statement of operations. The net gain is comprised of the deferred gain noted above, less the redemption premium, write off of unamortized offering expenses, and transaction related costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a non exclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash, $5.0 million in December 2001 and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million over a three year period. As of June 27, 2004, a total amount of $17.5 million has been paid to Varian and the total obligation remaining is $2.5 million through December 2004. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $157.1 million in fiscal 2004, which consisted of net income for the year of $83.0 million, adjusted for non cash charges of $48.9 million and sources of working capital of $25.2 million. Non cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, and the net non cash gain recognized in fiscal 2004 as a result of the early retirement of our 4% Notes. Significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2004 include an increase of $138.4 million in accounts receivable due to increased sales volumes. We have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. dollar denominated accounts receivable. These sales of accounts receivable are intended to accelerate the collection of cash. We sold $158.7 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2004. Deferred income taxes decreased by $10.9 million. Trade payables increased by $57.8 million due to increased expense levels as a result of improved business volumes and timing of payments. Accrued liabilities increased by $29.6 million primarily due to an increase in variable incentive based compensation as well as a rise in income taxes payable as a result of the significant increase in profits. Deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue rose by $63.1 million, reflecting significantly increased rates of shipments and the timing of customer acceptances. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2004 was $48.5 million. We sold $66.9 million, net, of short term investments that contributed to the repayment of our 4% Notes in June, 2004. Net capital expenditures were $24.0 million and focused on computer equipment and machinery. Net property and equipment was $42.4 million at June 27, 2004, compared to $48.8 million at June 29, 2003. This decrease is primarily due to $23.4 million of depreciation expense, $3.8 million in write offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities, $2.4 32 Table of Contents million in write offs related to our decision to cease investment in CMP systems development which, together, exceed the $24.0 million in capital expenditures discussed above. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2004 was $211.7 million and consisted primarily of the principal repayment of our 4% Notes in the amount of $300.0 million. In connection with the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement, we received proceeds of $10.9 million. We also reissued $13.2 million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program and net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled $64.2 million. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in RD and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 27, 2004 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. 33 Table of Contents Risk Factors Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically; the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; timing of customer acceptances of equipment; the size and timing of orders from customers; customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations, and or acceptances; changes in average selling prices and product mix; our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; our competitors introduction of new products; legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; changes in import/export regulations; transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural disasters; legislative, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation; procurement shortages; manufacturing difficulties; the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations; new or modified accounting regulations; and exchange rate fluctuations. Further, because a significant amount of our RD and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High Priced Systems System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically range in price from approximately $0.4 million to $4.8 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter. Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues may be subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. 34 Table of Contents The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in RD and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. 35 Table of Contents We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and or have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitors Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitors Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular suppliers processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors equipment. We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors Strategic Relationships and Their Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process RD. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we 36 Table of Contents may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and or cash flows. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations Non U.S. sales, as a percentage of total revenue, accounted for approximately 82% in fiscal 2004, 72% in fiscal 2003 and 71% in fiscal 2002. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to: trade balance issues; regional economic and political conditions; changes in currency controls; differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; ability to develop relationships with local suppliers; compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions; fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates; and the need for technical support resources in different locations. Many of these challenges are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen denominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future. A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May Be Impaired The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training, managing, and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to 37 Table of Contents meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth. If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and or the price of our Common Stock. The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; global economic fluctuations; variations in our quarterly operating results; variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast; announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations, or introduction of new products; government regulations; developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; success or failure of our new and existing products; disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or political, economic, or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert managements attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. 38 Table of Contents We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e mail. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however, security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. The Potential Anti Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We Have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the Rights Plan) in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals. Our Rights Plan may have certain anti takeover effects. Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders, as defined by that statute. Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. 39 Table of Contents We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. Compliance with Internal Control Attestation and Outside Audit Firm Independence Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we will be required, beginning with our fiscal year ending June 26, 2005, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2005. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm (Firm) will be required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005. We have not yet completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control. If we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations. Our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the Firm and the Company that, in the Firms professional judgment, might have a bearing on the Firms independence with respect to the Company. If , for whatever reason, our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of the Company based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations. 40 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio, long term assets and long term debt obligations at June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003: June 29, June 27, 2004 2003 There Fair 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After Total Value Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate $ 57,739 $ $ $ $ $ $ 57,739 $ 57,739 $ 119,805 Average rate 1.20 % 1.20 % 1.14 % Short term investments Fixed rate $ 59,756 $ 123,851 $ 63,330 $ 15,471 $ 601 $ $ 263,009 $ 261,069 $ 232,718 Average rate 1.78 % 2.24 % 3.27 % 3.63 % 4.60 % 2.47 % 2.20 % Auction rate preferreds Variable rate $ 4,998 $ $ $ $ $ $ 4,998 $ 5,000 $ 106,186 Average rate 1.29 % 1.29 % 1.48 % Restricted cash Fixed rate $ 112,468 $ $ $ $ $ $ 112,468 $ 112,468 $ 118,468 Average rate 1.00 % 1.00 % 1.06 % Total investment securities $ 234,961 $ 123,851 $ 63,330 $ 15,471 $ 601 $ $ 438,214 $ 436,276 $ 577,177 Average rate 1.25 % 2.24 % 3.27 % 3.63 % 4.60 % 1.91 % 1.61 % Long term debt Fixed rate $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 300,000 Average Rate 4.00 % We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We had no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate 4% Notes. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Japanese Yen denominated assets. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. On June 27, 2004, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $48.1 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 27, 2004, was $0.1 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $8.5 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $6.2 million. 41 Table of Contents
