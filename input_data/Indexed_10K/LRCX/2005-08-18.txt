Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Results of Operations Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the worlds semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product offerings that include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, wafer cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over recent business cycles, the severity of these fluctuations has increased, and todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Executive Summary We believe our business model continues to set a standard for the industry. Our business model is focused on new product development, sales and marketing, and customer support which are the core competencies of the Company. Indicators of customer demand began to improve in our quarter ended September 28, 2003. This trend continued through the quarter ended September 26, 2004, then declined and stabilized over the course of the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters. Fiscal year 2005 revenues increased 61% compared to fiscal year 2004 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with particularly strong performance in Asia. The progression in our gross margin of five percentage points from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was achieved on increased sales volume, improvements in product mix, and effective asset management. Total operating expenses increased by $48.2 million, or 15% during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. Increases in operating expenses were primarily driven by increases in salary and benefits costs for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as increases for incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. Fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included restructuring charges of $14.2 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value guarantee obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans. 14 Table of Contents New Orders and Backlog New orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2005 were approximately: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 26, March 27, December 26, September 26, June 26, 2005 2005 2004 2004 2005 (in millions) $315 $ 315 $ 387 $ 429 $ 1,446 Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 26, 2005 were approximately $351 million. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect, among other things, customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations. Please refer to Backlog in Part I Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information on our backlog policy. Regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 26, March 27, December 26, September 26, June 26, 2005 2005 2004 2004 2005 North America 9 % 16 % 14 % 20 % 15 % Europe 12 % 19 % 9 % 19 % 15 % Asia Pacific 35 % 29 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Korea 16 % 14 % 40 % 15 % 22 % Japan 28 % 22 % 12 % 20 % 20 % Indicators of customer demand for wafer processing equipment improved in the quarter ended September 28, 2003 and continued through the quarter ended September 26, 2004. Since that time, new orders have declined and stabilized in the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters, which reflects the investment decisions of our customers. We expect new orders for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 to range from flat to down 5% compared with the quarter ended June 26, 2005. This expectation is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenue $ 1,502,453 $ 935,946 $ 755,234 Revenue increased significantly during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. This increase reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. We believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with particularly strong performance in Asia. Our deferred revenue 15 Table of Contents balance was $150.5 million as of June 26, 2005. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $53 million as of June 26, 2005. These shipments are classified as inventory and carried at cost. The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2005 continued the trends noted for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003, which were reflective of a market environment that had improved, evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 North America 16 % 18 % 28 % Europe 12 % 19 % 20 % Asia Pacific 38 % 42 % 29 % Korea 19 % 10 % 15 % Japan 15 % 11 % 8 % The overall Asia region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is shifting toward this region; this trend continued through fiscal year 2005. The growth in Asia Pacific revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in Taiwan and Singapore. Our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 ranges from $310 million to $330 million. This is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Gross Margin Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 764,092 $ 431,049 $ 303,829 Percent of total revenue 50.9 % 46.1 % 40.2 % The increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume. The increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2004 compared with fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources, expense management programs, and improved sales volumes throughout the year. We expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 47% for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 which includes approximately $3 million, or one percentage point, in stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). This expectation is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 16 Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except percentages) Research Development (RD) $ 194,115 $ 170,479 $ 160,493 Percent of total revenue 12.9 % 18.2 % 21.3 % We continue to invest significantly in research and development in business cycle upturns and downturns. Our investments have been aimed at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of next generation products as well as enhancing our existing offerings. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $9 million for incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in RD supplies expense of approximately $6 million. Approximately 51% of fiscal year 2005 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The growth in spending between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $10 million, a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. These costs were partially offset by reductions in facilities related expenses, largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly $2 million, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General Administrative (SGA) $ 164,774 $ 146,063 $ 132,820 Percent of total revenue 11.0 % 15.6 % 17.6 % The increase in SG&A expenses during the year ended June 26, 2005 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $14 million due to incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also included in the increase was approximately $10 million in professional services which included, among other items, expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. These increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a net $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately $3 million in stock based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award. Expenses in fiscal year 2004 were $13 million higher than fiscal year 2003 because employee compensation costs increased by nearly $12 million, a result of planned increases of employee compensation and incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also contributing to the fiscal year 2004 SGA expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately $5 million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects. Additionally, the $3 million stock based compensation charge noted above contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2004. A decrease of approximately $4 million, primarily in depreciation expense, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above. 17 Table of Contents We expect total operating expenses (RD and SGA) in the quarter ending September 25, 2005 will be approximately $100 million which includes an estimated $6 million of stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). These estimates are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Restructuring Charges We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. We have historically developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and, at times, depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry. We systematically reviewed our revenue outlook and forecasts and assessed their impact on required employment levels, facilities utilization, and outsourcing activities scope. Based on these evaluations, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended March 28, 2004 (the March 2004 Plan), December 28, 2003 (the December 2003 Plan), September 28, 2003 (the September 2003 Plan), June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan), December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan), December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective Plan. Severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments recorded in the restructuring charges include facilities for which a contract was terminated in accordance with its terms and charges for facilities, or a portion of facilities we ceased to use. Expenses were based on managements estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, where these items were determined to have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. As of June 26, 2005, the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Fiscal year 2004 restructurings $ $ $ Fiscal year 2003 restructurings 3,989 3,989 Fiscal year 2002 restructurings 178 926 1,104 Pre fiscal year 2002 restructurings 508 508 Balance at June 26, 2005 178 5,423 5,601 Less: portion included in other current liabilities 178 3,139 3,317 Included in long term liabilities $ $ 2,284 $ 2,284 The severance and benefits related balance is anticipated to be utilized by the end of calendar year 2005. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2011. 18 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2005 Activity During the quarter ended March 27, 2005, we recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During the March 2005 quarter, we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale. We concluded, under the provisions of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, that the likelihood that a liability had been incurred was probable and estimable. This transaction resulted in an increase of $10.2 million and $4.0 million to our fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans accruals, respectively. During the quarter ended June 26, 2005 we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer. We exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities, which had been abandoned in prior periods. Pursuant to the lease and participation agreements, our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4 million, was paid during the quarter ended June 26, 2005. This transaction is reflected in the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan accrual tables below. Fiscal Year 2004 Restructuring Activities Our fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce by less than 40 employees, primarily in North America and Europe and by vacating selected facilities located in North America and Asia deemed to be no longer necessary to our operations. The employees were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization. We recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately $6.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $1.2 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $2.8 million, and the write off of related leasehold improvements of $1.6 million. We also recorded a charge of approximately $1.0 million due to the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Japan and $2.1 million for the write off of related leasehold improvements. We recognized $1.9 million of additional facilities related expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal year 2004. Charges during the year were partially offset by the recovery of $1.5 million of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in Japan. Additional offsetting items include recovery of $0.7 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and $1.7 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring. The inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold. As a result of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities, we expected quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of approximately $0.3 million from the March 2004 Plan, $0.7 million from the December 2003 Plan and $0.5 million from the September 2003 Plan. The majority of the savings were expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings from the Plans discrete actions were primarily related to lower employee payroll, rent, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts. Through June 26, 2005, we believe actual savings from these Plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings. The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $10.2 million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity. 19 Table of Contents The following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2004 restructuring plans: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 30 $ 2,077 $ 2,107 Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge 10,157 10,157 Cash payments (30 ) (12,234 ) (12,264 ) Balance at June 26, 2005 $ $ $ Fiscal Year 2003 Restructuring Activities Our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2003 through our June 2003, March 2003 and December 2002 Plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of approximately $18.1 million. Our fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 200 people and vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plans were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America. The $18.1 million restructuring charges consisted of $5.7 million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees and $12.4 million of facilities related charges. The facilities related charges consisted of the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write off of related leasehold improvements. In June 2003, a lease covering one of our vacated facilities at our Fremont, California campus was amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure. At the time of the amendment, the leased facilitys fair value was less than its original cost by approximately $1 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $18.1 million of restructuring charges. As a result of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities, we expected quarterly savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, of approximately $1.0 million from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March 2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December 2002 Plan. The majority of the savings were expected to be realized within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings were primarily from lower payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Through June 26, 2005, we believe realized savings are consistent with original forecasts. However, other factors may significantly influence our future cost structure and, consequently, partially or totally offset savings from these Plans. The following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2003 restructuring plans: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 183 $ 6,451 $ 6,634 Cash payments (183 ) (2,462 ) (2,645 ) Balance at June 26, 2005 $ $ 3,989 $ 3,989 20 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2002 Restructuring Activities Our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2002 through our December 2001 and September 2001 Plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal year 2002 of approximately $54.8 million. Our fiscal year 2002 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 1,020 people, vacating selected facilities at our Fremont, California campus deemed to be no longer required for our operations, the closure of certain offices in Asia, and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 83% from North America and approximately 17% from Europe and Asia locations. The restructuring charges included $25.0 million in severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $11.4 million in charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, $10.8 million in write offs of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets, and $7.6 million in inventory write downs. The inventory charge of approximately $7.6 million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems within our etch product lines. We recovered approximately $1.7 million during fiscal year 2004, $1.0 million during fiscal year 2003, and $0.7 million during fiscal year 2002, from unanticipated subsequent sales of these inventories to our installed base. We physically disposed of approximately $1.0 million of this inventory during fiscal year 2004 and $2.7 million during fiscal years 2003 and 2002. During fiscal year 2002, we also recovered approximately $1.0 million of the $54.8 million due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than planned expenses related to a vacated facility of $0.3 million. During fiscal year 2004, we recorded approximately $0.4 million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately $1.4 million, net, due to the difference between costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2003, we recovered approximately $2.7 million for benefits offered that were not utilized by terminated employees and $2.0 million was recovered due to revisions to the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities. We also recorded additional restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of $3.1 million due to revisions we made in sublease assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California, $0.1 million due to additional facility restoration costs, and $0.4 million for revisions that we made in our estimates for employee termination costs. The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $4.0 million in the table below is for the additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity. The following is a table summarizing restructuring activities relating to our fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans: Severance and Benefits Facilities Total (in thousands) Balance at June 27, 2004 $ 389 $ 3,496 $ 3,885 Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge 4,044 4,044 Cash payments (211 ) (6,614 ) (6,825 ) Balance at June 26, 2005 $ 178 $ 926 $ 1,104 Fiscal Year 2001 Restructuring Activities During the second quarter of fiscal year 2003, we completed the remaining elements of our restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan. A final $1.1 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. The remaining $0.5 million facilities balance as of June 26, 2005 is expected to be paid by January, 2006. 21 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, was $8.1 million, $4.5 million and ($10.3) million in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and consisted of the following: Year Ended June 26, June 27, June 29, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Interest income $ 17,537 $ 9,915 $ 15,804 Loss on equity derivative contracts (16,407 ) Interest expense (1,413 ) (4,634 ) (6,096 ) Foreign exchange loss (1,175 ) (1,334 ) (272 ) Debt issue cost amortization (1,593 ) (2,536 ) Net gain on settlement of swap and retirement of 4% Notes 4,505 Equity method investment losses (205 ) (426 ) (777 ) Equity method investment impairment (445 ) Charitable contributions (5,500 ) (1,000 ) Other, net (679 ) (963 ) 24 $ 8,120 $ 4,470 $ (10,260 ) The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields. Interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated $300.0 million 4% notes (4% Notes) in June 2004. We elected to make charitable contributions of $5.5 million during fiscal year 2005. During fiscal year 2004, our total cash balances, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash, increased each quarter through March 2004. These increases in cash balances allowed us to repay, in the June 2004 quarter, our 4% Notes prior to maturity. Although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year, interest income decreased during fiscal year 2004 as a result of lower market rates. The decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal year 2004 is largely due to the redemption of our 5% $300.0 million subordinated debentures (5% Notes) in September 2002. Tax Expense (Benefit) Our annual income tax expense (benefit) was $99.8 million, $27.7 million, and ($7.9) million, in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25%, which primarily reflects the impact of RD tax credits and the proportion of foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. statutory tax rates. In fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required. This resulted in a $12.7 million credit recorded to income tax expense, during fiscal year 2004. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to RD tax credits resulting in our recording a $24.9 million tax benefit in June 2003. In addition, a tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the longer term, limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in June 2003. 22 Table of Contents Deferred Income Taxes We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $248.0 million and $303.3 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $106.0 million and $67.8 million and deferred tax liabilities of $22.2 million and $26.3 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Our current valuation allowance of $106.0 million includes the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options. When the stock option tax benefits are realized, a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. During fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance of $12.7 million as discussed above. On October 22, 2004 the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA provides for a deduction of 85% of certain non U.S. earnings that are repatriated to the U.S., as defined in the AJCA. On January 13, 2005 and May 10, 2005 the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005 10 and Notice 2005 38, respectively, providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction. Based on our current understanding of the AJCA, we believe the range of possible amounts that we may consider for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million. The potential range of related income tax that may be incurred as a result of the repatriation is between zero and $26 million. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or 23 Table of Contents customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor performance levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. 24 Table of Contents Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Stock Based Compensation Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Incentive Plans : We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation. Our ESPP is a non compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB No. 25. Please see Recent Accounting Pronouncements below regarding the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) which will become effective during our quarter ending September 25, 2005. Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions. We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level of RD spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 25 Table of Contents The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We account for income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF 03 01. The consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method. In September 2004, the FASB issued a final FASB Staff Position (FSP), EITF Issue 03 01 1, which indefinitely delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of EITF 03 01. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting EITF 03 01. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB No. 43), Chapter 4, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). We are required to adopt SFAS No. 151 in fiscal year 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. In March, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB No. 107) which provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for us beginning with the quarter ended September 25, 2005. The effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on our results of operations and financial position are dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of employee stock options outstanding and unvested, the number of stock based awards which may be granted in the future, the life and vesting features of stock based awards which may be granted in the future, the future market value and volatility of our stock, movements in the risk free rate of interest, award exercise and forfeiture patterns, and the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of each award. We are currently evaluating these variables in the design of our stock based compensation program as well as the accounting requirements under SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. In addition, we intend to utilize restricted stock units as a key component of our ongoing employee incentive based compensation plan. These awards generally are recorded at their fair value, equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of issuance, and this amount is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period of the shares of restricted stock held by the employee. Based on the expense for our ESPP, our outstanding unvested options, and any outstanding unvested restricted stock units, we believe that the expense for stock based compensation for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 will range from $8 million to $10 million, pre tax. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 also eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We will apply its provisions prospectively upon adoption, and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. 26 Table of Contents In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. This statement replaces APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3 and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. APB No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: Operating Purchase Restructuring Leases Obligations Liabilities Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 13,260 $ 98,497 $ 3,317 $ 115,074 1 3 years 15,101 55,814 2,240 73,155 4 5 years 77,157 21,367 30 98,554 Over 5 years 790 498 14 1,302 Total $ 106,308 $ 176,176 $ 5,601 $ 288,085 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, RD and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the operating leases 4 5 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus. Please see the Guarantees section below for additional information. The remaining balances primarily relate to non cancelable facility related operating leases expiring at various dates through 2021. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 26, 2005 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges. 27 Table of Contents Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 26, 2005, vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were approximately $14.8 million. Restructuring Liabilities Our total restructuring reserves as of June 26, 2005 were $5.6 million, including $0.2 million of severance and benefits related costs and $5.4 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect $3.3 million to be paid over the next twelve months and $2.3 million to be paid between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2011. Please see the related discussion in Restructuring Activities within Managements Discussion and Analysis. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. During fiscal year 2005 we recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During fiscal year 2005 we contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale and we received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer. Pursuant to the lease and participation agreements, our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4 million, was paid in the quarter ended June 26, 2005. We exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for these facilities which were abandoned in prior periods. The facilities noted above were among several facilities for which lease agreements were transferred to a new lessor, amended, combined and restated in March and June of 2003. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the case that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 26, 2005 in separate, specified interest bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and is therefore not consolidated by us. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements, including indemnification for various environmental matters. We have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June 26, 2005, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. 28 Table of Contents We have agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee payment of our Japanese subsidiarys overdraft protection obligation. At June 26, 2005, the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements was approximately $2.8 million, although our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under these agreements. We have an agreement enabling us to sell to a financial institution certain U.S. dollar denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems, subject to recourse provisions. We discontinued the use of this program during the quarter ended June 26, 2005 and have no current plans to continue usage. At June 26, 2005 we had no outstanding and uncollected receivables under this agreement. Generally, we indemnify, under pre determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of June 26, 2005, we had $894.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash compared with $541.9 million at June 27, 2004. During fiscal year 2005, cash and cash equivalents increased by $318.8 million, including cash provided by operating activities of $425.9 million, partially offset by cash used for investing activities $58.7 million and cash used for financing activities of $52.3 million. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $425.9 million during fiscal year 2005, consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 299.3 Non cash charges: Restructuring 14.2 Depreciation and amortization 25.5 Other, net 5.8 Decrease in deferred tax assets 89.4 Change in other working capital accounts (8.3 ) $ 425.9 Significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2005 include a decrease of $13.5 million in net accounts receivable reflecting our focus on timely customer payments. We discontinued use of our program to sell certain U.S. dollar denominated accounts receivable during the quarter ended June 26, 2005, and we have no current plans to continue usage of the program. There were no uncollected sold receivables remaining as of June 26, 2005. The change in deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred profit decreased by $18.9 million reflecting marginally higher revenues as compared to shipments during fiscal year 2005. 29 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2005 was $58.7 million and consisted of net purchases of $63.3 million of short term investments and net capital expenditures of $22.8 million which consisted primarily of engineering equipment. Restricted cash decreased by $27.4 million as a result of the closing of the property sale of certain lease facilities discussed in the Guarantees section above. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2005 was $52.3 million including stock repurchases of $167.1 million partially offset by net proceeds of $114.3 million from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and $0.5 million of reissuance of treasury stock. In October, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock from the public market or in private purchases. The terms of the repurchase program permit us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2007. During fiscal year 2005, we repurchased 5,855,000 shares of common stock at a total price of $167.1 million. As of June 26, 2005, the total amount available for repurchase under this program was $82.9 million. We expect to continue to purchase shares under this program. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in RD and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we believe our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 26, 2005 are sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. 30 Table of Contents Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this Form 10 K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements. No priority or significance is intended, or should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear. Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to: economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically; the extent that customers use our products and services in their business; timing of customer acceptances of equipment; the size and timing of orders from customers; customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations, and or acceptances; changes in average selling prices and product mix; our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products; our competitors introduction of new products; legal or technical challenges to our products and technology; changes in import/export regulations; transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural disasters; legislative, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation; procurement shortages; manufacturing difficulties; the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations; new or modified accounting regulations; and exchange rate fluctuations. Further, because a significant amount of our RD and administrative operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance. We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High Priced Systems System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically range in price from approximately $0.4 million to $5.7 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter. 31 Table of Contents Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact on Shipments Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results. We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in RD and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Moreover, future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by: a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products; export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions which limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments; 32 Table of Contents an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in; increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines; technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than are our competitors that offer additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is affected by our customers use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors. We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on our Business Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While this could work to our advantage if Lams equipment becomes the basis for the function or process, it could work to our disadvantage if a competitors tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such function or process. In the latter case, even if Lams equipment was previously used by a customer, that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the alliance. Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitors equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business. We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers We obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long term contracts with many of these suppliers. These long term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships. 33 Table of Contents Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and or have a negative effect on our operating results. Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitors Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitors Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular suppliers processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitors equipment. We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors Strategic Relationships and Their Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process RD. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations Non U.S. sales, accounted for approximately 84% in fiscal year 2005, 82% in fiscal year 2004 and 72% in fiscal year 2003 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to: trade balance issues; economic and political conditions; changes in currency controls; differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions; our ability to develop relationships with local suppliers; compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions; fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates; the need for technical support resources in different locations; and our ability to secure and retain qualified people for the operation of our business. Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen denominated assets and forecasted Japanese Yen denominated revenue and will continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, in the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction Moreover, by hedging our Yen denominated assets with currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends, that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the Yen, and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we have business (such as the payment of wages and leases) in other currencies. Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By Higher Than Expected Tax Rates Or Exposure To Additional Income Tax Liabilities As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. Further, if we elect to repatriate cash held outside the United States pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, our tax rate may increase, even if by a lesser amount than without such legislation. Changes in Accounting Standards for Stock Based Compensation May Adversely Affect our Operating Results, Our Stock Price, and Our Competitiveness in the Employee Marketplace The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to expense all stock based compensation provided to employees beginning with our quarter ending September 25, 2005. The environment for skilled employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a competitive one, and we believe that stock based compensation is an important part of the overall compensation that we offer to attract and retain such employees. SFAS No. 123(R) will decrease our earnings based on its measure of the value of stock based compensation. There is some risk that the design of our compensation plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and employee retention objectives. Moreover, as we will be adopting these rules before certain other companies in our industry, there may be, for some period of time, an appearance that our earnings are lower than those of comparable companies that have not yet adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which could have a negative effect on our stock price. 35 Table of Contents A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May Be Impaired The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training, managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth. If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and or the price of our Common Stock. 36 Table of Contents The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following: general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions; global economic fluctuations; variations in our quarterly operating results; variations in our revenues or earnings from levels experienced by other companies in our industry or forecasts by securities analysts; announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of operations, or introduction of new products; government regulations; developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights; success or failure of our new and existing products; liquidity of Lam; disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or political, economic, or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions. In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert managements attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock. We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e mail. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however, security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. The Potential Anti Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation May Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders, as defined by that statute. Such factors might deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers, even if such takeover proposals or control changes could improve our short term stock price. 37 Table of Contents Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property, there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur. We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. We Are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we are required, beginning with our fiscal year ended June 26, 2005, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm (Firm) is required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. We have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our Firms attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005. In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our Firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis Our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the Firm and Lam that, in the Firms professional judgment, might have a bearing on the Firms independence with respect to us. If, for whatever reason, our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of Lam based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004: June 27, June 26, 2005 2004 There Fair 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After Total Value Total (in thousands) Cash equivalents Fixed rate $ 378,183 $ $ $ $ $ $ 378,183 $ 378,183 $ 57,739 Average rate 3.05 % 3.05 % 1.20 % Short term investments Fixed rate $ 167,979 $ 81,707 $ 44,250 $ 18,512 $ 13,724 $ 2,674 $ 328,846 $ 327,003 $ 263,009 Average rate 3.60 % 4.34 % 4.42 % 4.52 % 4.33 % 5.00 % 3.99 % 2.47 % Auction rate preferreds Variable rate $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 4,998 Average rate 1.29 % Restricted cash Fixed rate $ 85,038 $ $ $ $ $ $ 85,038 $ 85,038 $ 112,468 Average rate 3.00 % 3.00 % 1.00 % Total investment securities $ 631,200 $ 81,707 $ 44,250 $ 18,512 $ 13,724 $ 2,674 $ 792,067 $ 790,224 $ 438,214 Average rate 3.19 % 4.34 % 4.42 % 4.52 % 4.33 % 5.00 % 3.43 % 1.91 % We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, and certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies. The majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries local currency. As a result, we believe that our primary exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation is naturally hedged (the revenue in local currency partially offsets the exposure to local currency expenses) except for our Japanese Yen revenue exposure in Japan. For this reason, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen denominated receivable balances. The change in fair value of these contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $32.6 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 26, 2005, was $0.4 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $5.8 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $4.2 million. On June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $66.2 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $11.7 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $8.6 million. 39 Table of Contents
