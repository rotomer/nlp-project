Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. MDA consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Executive Summary Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major provider of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the worlds semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product offerings that include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers. The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) and demonstrates our strong performance and the quarter over quarter growth in all areas throughout fiscal year 2006: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 25, March 26, December 25, September 25, June 25, 2006 2006 2005 2005 2006 Revenue $ 525,596 $ 437,423 $ 358,245 $ 320,907 $ 1,642,171 Gross margin 274,151 219,654 177,510 156,079 827,394 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 52.2 % 50.2 % 49.5 % 48.6 % 50.4 % Net income 122,149 86,337 77,778 49,491 335,755 Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.84 $ 0.60 $ 0.55 $ 0.35 $ 2.34 Our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product development, sales and marketing, and customer support. We are focused on executing to the near term production requirements of 20 Table of Contents our customers, expanding our leadership position in Etch, leveraging our Etch expertise into adjacent markets, and our objective of delivering best in class financial performance. Customer demand increased throughout fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2006 new orders entered into backlog increased 31% compared to fiscal year 2005 with growth occurring in all regions as a function of the increase in customer demand. Fiscal year 2006 revenues, derived from our shipment levels and installation and acceptance timelines, increased 9% compared to fiscal year 2005 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with the strongest geographic momentum in Japan and Korea. Gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50% for the second consecutive year. Fiscal year 2006 quarterly gross margin as a percent of revenues showed steady growth on increasing volume. Total operating expenses increased 13% during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005, primarily driven by increases in discretionary RD spending consistent with our product and market expansion plans, equity based compensation expense, salary costs as a result of increased headcount, planned increases in employee base compensation, and employee incentive based costs. Fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included $14.2 million in restructuring charges related to prior restructuring plans. Equity based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2006 in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $5.0 million and $17.8 million, respectively. Results of Operations New Orders and Backlog New orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2006 are presented in the table below. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 25, 2006 were approximately $521 million. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to Backlog in Part I Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information on our backlog policy. 21 Table of Contents Regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 25, March 26, December 25, September 25, June 25, 2006 2006 2005 2005 2006 New Orders (in millions) $ 640 $ 520 $ 403 $ 326 $ 1,889 North America 12 % 15 % 13 % 17 % 14 % Europe 16 % 15 % 12 % 15 % 15 % Asia Pacific 44 % 28 % 29 % 33 % 34 % Korea 11 % 29 % 23 % 13 % 19 % Japan 17 % 13 % 23 % 22 % 18 % Three Months Ended Year Ended June 26, March 27, December 26, September 26, June 26, 2005 2005 2004 2004 2005 New Orders (in millions) $ 315 $ 315 $ 387 $ 429 $ 1,446 North America 9 % 16 % 14 % 20 % 15 % Europe 12 % 19 % 9 % 19 % 15 % Asia Pacific 35 % 29 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Korea 16 % 14 % 40 % 15 % 22 % Japan 28 % 22 % 12 % 20 % 20 % Fiscal year 2005 started with a declining trend in new orders which stabilized in the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters. The four quarters ending June 25, 2006 showed sequentially increasing demand in new orders driven by increased capital investments by our customers and our market share gains. During fiscal year 2006, 300 millimeter applications represented approximately 81% of total systems new orders and 83% of total systems new orders were for applications at less than or equal to the 90 nanometer technology node. We classify total systems new orders market segmentation for fiscal year 2006 as Memory at approximately 54%, IDM Logic/Other at 27% and Foundry at 19% of the total. We expect new orders for the quarter ending September 24, 2006 to increase 5% to 10% compared with the quarter ended June 25, 2006. This expectation is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Revenue $ 1,642,171 $ 1,502,453 $ 935,946 The increase in revenues during fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 reflected the improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers. We believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period, with particularly strong geographic performance in Japan and Korea during fiscal year 2006 and the overall Asia region during fiscal year 2005. The overall Asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $229.7 million as of June 25, 2006 compared to $150.5 million at June 26, 2005, consistent with overall business volumes. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $74 million as of June 25, 2006: these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. 22 Table of Contents Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows: Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 North America 14 % 16 % 18 % Europe 13 % 12 % 19 % Asia Pacific 29 % 38 % 42 % Korea 22 % 19 % 10 % Japan 22 % 15 % 11 % Our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending September 24, 2006 ranges from $580 million to $600 million. This is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Gross Margin Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 827,394 $ 764,092 $ 431,049 Percent of total revenue 50.4 % 50.9 % 46.1 % Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 remained greater than 50% for the second consecutive year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 decreased slightly, impacted by the inclusion of equity based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) of $5.0 million, or 0.3%. The impact of product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance, and improved factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume. We expect that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 51.5% for the quarter ending September 24, 2006. This expectation is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Research and Development Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except percentages) Research Development (RD) $ 228,891 $ 194,115 $ 170,479 Percent of total revenue 13.9 % 12.9 % 18.2 % We invested significantly in research and development focused on leading edge plasma etch, strip and clean product and market applications. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately $19 million in increased supplies and outside services, approximately $9 million in increased equity based compensation expense and approximately $4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Approximately 66% of fiscal year 2006 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $9 million for incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in RD supplies expense of approximately $6 million. 23 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General Administrative (SGA) $ 192,238 $ 164,774 $ 146,063 Percent of total revenue 11.7 % 11.0 % 15.6 % The increase in SGA expenses during the year ended June 25, 2006 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $4 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Increases in incentive based cash compensation of approximately $7 million were principally due to our long term executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equity based compensation was approximately $9 million. Fiscal year 2005 SGA expenses were lower due to the March 2005 receipt of an $8 million tax refund noted below. The increase in SGA expenses during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $14 million due to incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also included in the increase was approximately $10 million in professional services which included, among other items, expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the Company. These increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a net $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately $3 million in equity based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 25, June 26, June 27, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Interest income $ 38,189 $ 17,537 $ 9,915 Interest expense (677 ) (1,413 ) (4,634 ) Foreign exchange loss (1,458 ) (1,175 ) (1,334 ) Debt issue cost amortization (368 ) (1,593 ) Net gain on settlement of swap and retirement of 4% Notes 4,505 Equity method investment losses (205 ) (426 ) Equity method investment impairment (445 ) Charitable contributions (1,000 ) (5,500 ) (1,000 ) Other, net 336 (679 ) (963 ) $ 35,022 $ 8,120 $ 4,470 The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. During fiscal year 2006, average interest rate yields on the Companys portfolio increased approximately 170 basis points compared to fiscal year 2005. The Companys total balances of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments, increased approximately $626 million from fiscal year 2005. This increase included the Companys wholly owned subsidiarys drawdown against a $350 million Credit Agreement to support the Companys foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The remaining increase of $276 million was primarily driven by $361 million from cash flows from operating activities. 24 Table of Contents The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields. Interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated $300.0 million 4% notes (4% Notes) in June 2004. Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $105.5 million, $99.8 million, and $27.7 million, in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 23.9%. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006, excluding the discrete event discussed below, was 18.4%. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2006 related to the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate, the realization of state RD tax credits not previously benefited, favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bi lateral advanced pricing arrangement. These favorable adjustments for the year were offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a $500 million extraordinary dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, combined with the impact of the accounting for equity based awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions, and the expiration of the research tax credit on December 31, 2005. The fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25.0%, which primarily reflects the impact of RD tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. statutory tax rates. In fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required. This resulted in a $12.7 million credit recorded to income tax expense, during fiscal year 2004. Deferred Income Taxes We had gross deferred tax assets, related primarily to reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible, and tax credit carryforwards of $119.2 million and $142.1 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $27.0 million and $22.2 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), the additional tax benefit associated with the accumulated stock award attributes is not recognized until the deduction reduces cash taxes payable. As such, we have elected to net our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only realize these attributes in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS 123(R). These additional tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards were $125.2 million and $106.0 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. During fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance of $12.7 million on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required. Subsequent Events On July 12, 2006, the Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam with respect to a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers. As a result of the denied review, the prior rulings from the trial and appellate courts stand resulting in a judgment in favor of Lam of approximately $15.8 million, which includes approximately $2.0 million in post judgment interest. We plan to record this amount in other income (expense), net during the quarter ending September 24, 2006. 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market 26 Table of Contents conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity based Compensation Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans: Beginning on June 27, 2005 we account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we accounted for our ESPP and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in paid in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid in capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under APB No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid in capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS123(R). Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. 27 Table of Contents We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level of RD spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Companys expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operation and financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 25, 2006, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments compared with $894.3 million at June 26, 2005. We entered into long term debt of $350.0 million during fiscal year 2006 to provide sufficient liquidity to support our foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The remaining increase of $276.1 million was derived from cash flows from operating activities of $360.7 million, issuance of common stock from employee equity based plans of $194.6 million, partially offset by stock repurchases of $251.2 million and capital expenditures and purchases of intangible assets of $42.1 million. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $360.7 million during fiscal year 2006 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 335.8 Non cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 22.0 Equity based compensation 22.8 Other, net 2.3 Income tax benefit on equity based compensation plans 27.8 Excess tax benefit on equity based compensation plans (17.8 ) Decrease in deferred tax assets 27.7 Change in other working capital accounts (59.9 ) $ 360.7 28 Table of Contents Significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $175.3 million and $58.7 million, respectively, due to the increased volume of business. These changes were partially offset by an increase in deferred profit of $50.4 million due to increased volume of shipments, an increase in accounts payable of $48.3 million, and increases in accrued liabilities of $88.4 million primarily due to VAT and income taxes payable related to higher profit levels, and an increase in accrued compensation based on incentive based compensation. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2006 was $244.3 million and consisted of a transfer to restricted cash and investments of $385.0 million due to our guarantee agreement related to the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiary under the $350.0 million credit agreement entered into during the quarter ended June 25, 2006. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement. In addition, we purchased $42.1 million for capital expenditures, consisting primarily of engineering equipment, and the purchase of intangible assets of intellectual property. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from the net sales of short term investments of $182.8 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2006 was $310.7 million consisting of $350.0 million from the issuance of long term debt, $194.6 million from the issuance of our common stock related to employee equity based plans, and $17.8 million of excess tax benefits on equity based compensation plans, partially offset by stock repurchases of $251.2 million. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares of common stock at a total price of $251.2 million under Board authorized repurchase programs which run through September 30, 2008. As of June 25, 2006 the total amount remaining available for repurchase under Board authorizations was $331.7 million. We expect to continue to repurchase shares consistent with the Board authorizations, the level of which will be determined by, including but not limited to, the needs of the business and the stock price and daily trading volumes of our stock. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in RD and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 25, 2006 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities and long term debt which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table: 29 Table of Contents Long term Operating Purchase Restructuring Debt and Leases Obligations Liabilities Interest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 14,821 $ 154,482 $ 1,590 $ 20,050 $ 190,943 1 3 years 86,613 42,905 40,209 169,727 4 5 years 2,142 8,306 390,044 400,492 Over 5 years 2,175 2,175 Total $ 105,751 $ 205,693 $ 1,590 $ 450,303 $ 763,337 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, RD and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the operating leases 1 3 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest bearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and is therefore not consolidated by us. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non cancelable facility related operating leases. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 25, 2006 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 25, 2006, vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory increased to $31.1 million compared to $14.8 million at June 26, 2005, due to the increased volume of our business. Restructuring Liabilities Our total restructuring reserves as of June 25, 2006 were $1.6 million, which consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect the remaining balance to be paid over the next twelve months. 30 Table of Contents Long Term Debt and Interest Expense On June 16, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). Under the Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under the Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. LRI may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the principal payment of $350 million due on June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated based on the current LIBOR rate of 5.5% and initial spread of ten basis points. The fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. We used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate the repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in the June 2006 quarter under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). We have now completed our repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We lease several facilities at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. As part of certain of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest bearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and is therefore not consolidated by us. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 25, 2006, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into by LRI noted above, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, representing $385.0 million at June 25, 2006. This collateral is reflected in the balance of restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Generally, we indemnify, under pre determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. 31 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long term debt. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005: June 26, June 25, 2006 2005 Fiscal Year Ending June 24, June 29, June 28, June 27, June 26, There Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After Total Value Total (in thousands, except percentages) Cash equivalents Variable rate $ 730,887 $ $ $ $ $ $ 730,887 $ 730,887 $ Average rate 4.95 % 4.95 % Fixed rate $ 113,566 $ $ $ $ $ $ 113,566 $ 113,509 $ 378,183 Average rate 5.10 % 5.10 % 3.05 % Short term investments Fixed rate $ 42,125 $ 25,411 $ 31,346 $ 23,819 $ 6,760 $ 12,870 $ 142,331 $ 139,524 $ 328,846 Average rate 3.86 % 3.93 % 4.43 % 4.26 % 5.14 % 4.37 % 4.19 % 3.99 % Restricted cash and investments Variable rate $ 70,575 $ $ $ $ $ $ 70,575 $ 70,575 $ Average rate 5.64 % 5.64 % Fixed rate $ 328,643 $ 25,395 $ 14,968 $ 4,552 $ 9,082 $ 17,810 $ 400,450 $ 399,463 $ 85,038 Average rate 5.08 % 4.94 % 5.27 % 4.83 % 5.89 % 5.66 % 5.12 % 3.00 % Total investment securities $ 1,285,796 $ 50,806 $ 46,314 $ 28,371 $ 15,842 $ 30,680 $ 1,457,809 $ 1,453,958 $ 792,067 Average rate 4.68 % 4.44 % 4.70 % 4.35 % 5.57 % 5.12 % 4.41 % 3.43 % Long term debt Variable rate $ $ $ $ $ 350,000 $ $ 350,000 $ 350,000 $ Average rate 5.65 % 5.65 % We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen denominated assets and forecasted Japanese Yen denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese Yen denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our Balance Sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen denominated net receivable balances. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $23.5 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 25, 2006, was $0.1 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $4.1 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $3.1 million. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $193.8 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would 32 Table of Contents result in an unrealized loss of $34.2 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $25.3 million. Our outstanding long term debt of $350.0 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. The principal payment of $350 million is due on June 19, 2011. The fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt.
