Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this 2007 Form 10 K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this 2007 Form 10 K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2007 Form 10 K. MDA consists of the following sections: Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements explains the results of the voluntary stock option review and related restatement of our financial statements. Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Subsequent Events discusses events impacting our operations that have occurred after June 24, 2007 Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements In this 2007 Form 10 K, the Company is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of June 25, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005 as a result of determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review conducted by the Independent Committee. The Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously reported financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paid in capital, deferred stock based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27, 2004. This restatement is also described in the Explanatory Note to this 2007 10 K, immediately preceding Part I Item I and in Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, to Consolidated Financial Statements. This 2007 Form 10 K also reflects the restatement of Selected Financial Data in Item 6 for the years ended June 25, 2006, June 26, 2005, June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003. In addition, the Company is restating the unaudited quarterly condensed financial statements for interim periods of fiscal year 2006, and unaudited condensed balance sheets as of March 25, 2007, December 24, 2006 and September 24, 2006. There was no effect of the restatement on the consolidated statements of operations for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007. Financial information included in the reports on Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and Form 8 K filed or furnished by Lam Research prior to January 24, 2008, and the related opinions of its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by the Company prior to January 24, 2008 are superseded in their entirety by this 2007 Form 10 K and other reports on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or after January 24, 2008. Independent Committee Review On July 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had initiated a voluntary independent review regarding the timing of and accounting for the Companys past stock option grants and other related issues. The voluntary internal review arose after the Companys Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm performed auditing procedures relating to the Companys historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of the firms fiscal year end 2007 audit. The Board of Directors appointed a special committee consisting of two independent board members (the Independent Committee) to conduct a comprehensive review of the Companys historical stock option practices. The Independent Committee promptly engaged independent outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to assist with the review. On December 21, 2007, the Company announced that the Independent Committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differed from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Upon the recommendation of management and the Independent Committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon. The Independent Committees review was completed in February 2008. 35 Table of Contents Scope of the Independent Committee Review The review covered stock option grants awarded in fiscal years 1997 through 2005 (the Review Period). The scope of the review included evaluating 100% of Company wide grants, director grants, Section 16 officer grants, and new hire grants, as well as a sampling of grants deemed other grants, representing approximately 94% of all stock option grants during the Review Period. This Review Period comprised approximately 16,000 separate stock option grants on approximately 500 separately recorded grant dates. These grants involved approximately 58 million underlying shares of Common Stock and included grants to domestic and international employees. Share amount have been adjusted as applicable to reflect the March 2000 3 for 1 stock split. The Independent Committees review also included procedures to identify potential modifications of stock option grants, and grants awarded to consultants, and testing of cash exercises. The Company had not awarded any Company wide stock option grants since October 2002 and stopped issuing stock option grants during fiscal year 2005 and only issued restricted stock units (RSUs) thereafter. The Independent Committee did not include fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in the scope of its review based on several factors including but not limited to the fact that the Company only issued RSUs after fiscal year 2005 and the Companys equity granting processes and controls had been documented and tested as part of its assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, no information arose during the stock option review that would indicate a need to expand the scope of the review to include other periods. The Independent Committees review included the collection and processing of over 3.5 million electronic documents, which included hard drives and network share drives of numerous individuals, the Companys network servers, and backup tapes. The Independent Committees advisors also collected and reviewed hard copy documents from numerous sources and conducted 61 interviews of 47 individuals, predominantly current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company. Stock Option Review Results Consistent with applicable accounting literature and guidance from the SEC staff, the Company organized the grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the process by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence from the Independent Committees review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, and underlying electronic data about documents. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company applied the applicable accounting standards to determine, for grants within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally recorded grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, in some cases resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects. The significant majority of the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. As a result of the findings of the review, the Company has recognized incremental stock based compensation and associated payroll tax expense of $96.4 million on a pre tax basis ($65.8 million after taxes) in the aggregate during fiscal years 1997 through 2006 which includes incremental stock based compensation expense of $1.2 million recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123R during fiscal year 2006. The Independent Committee also concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of Company management or the Companys independent directors. During its review of the Companys historical stock option practices, the Independent Committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues unrelated to stock based compensation. Company wide Grants Company wide grants were awarded on ten dates during the Review Period, and are associated with approximately half of the shares underlying option grants encompassed in the review. These ten dates include grants issued on six dates for broad based and primarily discretionary grants (focal grants), two grant dates that were formula based grants (supplemental grants) and two grant dates designed to address certain previously granted stock options for which the exercise price was higher than the then current fair value of the Companys Common Stock (cancel and replace grants). As a result of its review, the Company determined that the actual measurement dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates. The Company determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions necessary to grant the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to determine what, if any stock based compensation was appropriate. Any intrinsic value of the options on the measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing services in exchange for the options. With respect to the focal grants, the Company concluded that a process to determine the total number of shares underlying the options, grant date and exercise price generally commenced prior to the recorded grant date, but that in certain cases the specific allocation of those shares among the various option recipients was not finalized until after the original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these option grants to a date after the original grant date, when the allocation of the shares was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $61.2 million on a pre tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. 36 Table of Contents With respect to the supplemental grants, the Company determined that the general formula for determining the number of shares underlying the option grant to which each recipient would be entitled was not sufficiently finalized for accounting purposes at the original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date when this formula was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $5.6 million on a pre tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. The cancel and replace grants involved recipients electing to exchange certain stock options, for which the exercise price was higher than the then current fair value of the Companys Common Stock, in return for a new grant of options. The Company determined that in both instances, the election deadline was after the recorded grant date. The measurement date should have been the later of the recorded grant date or the date of election because the elections were revocable up to the last day of the offer period. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the last possible date of election. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $0.2 million on a pre tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. Grants to Directors and Section 16 Officers Director grants were awarded on ten dates during the stock option review period. Grants to directors were typically governed by the requirements of the underlying stock option plan documents, as grant dates and amounts were typically fixed by the respective stock option plan. There were instances when the grant dates were not consistent with dates fixed by the respective stock option plan. In all instances the grant date was within 1 to 3 days of the dates provided by the plan. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date as required by the stock option plan. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $2.8 million on a pre tax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates. Section 16 officer grants were awarded on 23 grant dates during the stock option review period. The Company determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions necessary to grant the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares. Any intrinsic value of the options on the measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing services in exchange for the options. In instances where the original recorded grant date was not consistent with the correct measurement date, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the number of shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $1.0 million on a pre tax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates. Additionally, it was determined that for one grant the recorded grant price was based on an average of closing prices of the Companys stock immediately prior to the grant date. The option plan under which this option was granted allowed for similar pricing. To address this circumstance the Company has recognized stock based compensation expense of $2.1 million on a pre tax basis for this grant, which was equal to the difference between the closing price of the stock on the date of grant and the originally recorded grant exercise price. Grants to Consultant The Company concluded that six granting actions to a non employee consultant were incorrectly accounted for as employee as opposed to non employee stock awards. To address this circumstance, the Company has recognized a stock based compensation expense of $3.2 million on a pre tax basis under fair value accounting in accordance with the requirements of EITF Issue No. 96 18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services. Grants to New Hires New hire grants were generally approved prior to the employees hire date and granted as of the last day of the month of hire prior to calendar year 1999 and on the first day of the individuals employment with the Company beginning in calendar year 1999. In instances where approval was not evidenced on or before the original recorded grant date, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the required approval was first evidenced, but not before the employees hire date. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $1.7 million on a pre tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. 37 Table of Contents Other Grants For the remaining population reviewed of stock options granted during the stock option review period, the Company has concluded that certain actual measurement dates differed from the recorded grant dates primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous documentation evidencing approval as of the original recorded grant date. In these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized. The primary issue with these grants was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the specific allocation of those shares among the various grant recipients was finalized at the original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the allocation of the shares underlying the options and exercise price was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $8.2 million on a pre tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates. Deemed Modifications to Stock Option Grants Connected with Terminations or Leaves of Absences Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of deemed modifications to certain employee stock option grant awards in connection with certain employees terminations or leaves of absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in additional shares in relation to a leave of absence or subsequent to their termination, thus triggering a new measurement date under the accounting literature applicable at that time. The Company has recognized stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $9.2 million on a pre tax basis as a result of these new measurement dates. Use of Judgment The Company evaluated all available evidence for each individual grant within the scope of the independent review and the revised measurement dates represent the earliest date when the terms of the options granted to individual recipients were known with finality. The proposed measurement date for certain grants could not be determined with certainty based on available evidence. In light of the judgment used in establishing the measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by the Company could have resulted in different stock based compensation expense than that recorded by the Company in the restatements. While the Company has considered these alternative approaches, it believes its approach is the most appropriate under the circumstances. The Company prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that it might have recorded for these grants if it had used different judgments to determine the revised measurement dates. The Company applied its sensitivity methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in stock based compensation expense within a reasonable range of possible measurement dates for each grant event. After developing the range for each grant event included in the Companys sensitivity analysis, the Company selected the highest and lowest closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range to determine the range of potential compensation expense adjustments for the grants. The Company then compared these aggregated amounts to the stock based compensation expense that it recorded for the stock option grants analyzed. If the Company had used the highest closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range for these grant events, its stock based compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have increased, net of forfeitures, by approximately $30 million on a pre tax basis. Conversely, had the Company used the lowest closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range for the grants analyzed, its stock based compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have decreased, net of forfeitures, by approximately $26 million on a pre tax basis. Substantially all of the hypothetical increases or decreases of stock based compensation expense resulting from the Companys sensitivity analysis relates to periods prior to fiscal 2005. Findings and Recommendations of the Independent Committee As a result of its review, the Independent Committee identified certain deficiencies relating to the Companys historical practices and accounting with respect to stock options, including the following areas: Historical Board and Compensation Committee procedures regarding the issuance and approval of stock option grants; Historical coordination among departments relating to the administration of the stock option grant process; Historical compliance with and application of accounting standards with respect to stock option grants; Compliance with certain of the Companys stock option plans; and Historical record keeping with respect to stock option grants. As a result of the deficiencies identified, the Independent Committee developed recommendations targeted at strengthening the Companys processes with respect to equity compensation and relating accounting. These recommendations were presented to the Board of Directors on February 1, 2008 and include the areas of: approval authority for equity compensation awards; oversight and administration of the awards process; coordination among relevant departments; training with respect to equity compensation; and record keeping. The Company is currently reviewing all of the Independent Committees recommendations as well as a potential timetable for implementation, but the Company believes that the substance of many of the recommendations of the Independent Committee have already been incorporated into the Companys current equity compensation processes. This belief is consistent with the determination by the Independent Committee and the Company that the granting of RSUs after fiscal year 2005 was not within the scope of the Independent Committee review in part due to the documentation and testing required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. 38 Table of Contents The Independent Committee concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of Company management or the Companys independent directors. Effect of Restatement on Consolidated Financial Statements The Company previously applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, through its fiscal year ended June 26, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, a non cash, stock based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual measurement date. Because certain of the Companys options were assessed as having an exercise price below the market price on the actual measurement date based on the Companys revised measurement dates as a result of the stock option review as more fully described above, there is a non cash deferred compensation charge for each of these options under APB Opinion No. 25 equal to the number of shares underlying the options, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual measurement date. That deferred compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the option. The Company also recorded compensation expense under fair value accounting when applicable, for example, for the grants to the nonemployee consultant noted above. Commencing in its fiscal year ended June 25, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2006, the additional stock based compensation expense required to be recorded for each option with a revised measurement date, as more fully described above, is equal to the fair value of the option on revised measurement date, amortized over the remaining service period of the option. The Company did not record these stock based compensation expenses under APB Opinion No. 25 nor SFAS No. 123(R) related to its options based on the revised measurement dates in the Companys previously issued financial statements, and that is why the Company is restating them in this filing. The Company restated its historical results of operations to record additional pre tax, non cash, stock based compensation expense of (a) $94.0 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 26, 2005 under APB Opinion No. 25 and other applicable accounting rules, and (b) $1.2 million for the year ended June 25, 2006 under SFAS No. 123(R). As of June 25, 2006, there was less than $0.1 million of remaining compensation expense to be recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) for stock options with revised measurement dates. In addition the Company recorded pre tax payroll related tax expenses of $1.2 million through June 25, 2006. Diluted shares in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 also increased as a result of the adjustments for stock options with revised measurement dates. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted average shares used in the diluted EPS calculation. As part of the restatement, the Company revised its treasury stock calculations in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. These calculations assume that (i) all dilutive options with revised measurement dates are exercised, (ii) the Company repurchases shares with the proceeds of these hypothetical exercises along with the tax benefit resulting from the hypothetical exercises, and (iii) any average unamortized deferred stock based compensation is also used to repurchase shares. As described for each element above, the Company evaluated the impact of the restatements on its global tax provision. As a result, we recorded a cumulative tax benefit of $30.6 million through June 25, 2006. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. In certain jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the United States, the Company is able to claim a tax deduction relative to stock options. In those jurisdictions, where a tax deduction is claimed, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets, totaling $6.2 million at June 25, 2006, to reflect future tax deductions to the extent the Company believes such assets to be recoverable. Based on this review, the Company now believes that it should not have taken a United States tax deduction in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m). Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, the Companys tax carryforward attributes have decreased by approximately $14.6 million as of June 25, 2006. For those stock option grants determined to have incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes and that had been originally issued as incentive stock options, or ISOs, the Company recorded a liability for payroll tax contingencies in the event such grants would not be respected as ISOs under the principles of the IRC and the regulations therein. The Company recorded expense and accrued liabilities for certain foreign payroll tax contingencies. The total payroll tax accrual was approximately $1.2 million for annual periods from our fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2006. This cumulative expense resulted from payroll tax expense recorded in prior periods has been partially offset by benefits relating to the expiration of the related statute of limitations. As a result of the restatement, the cumulative effect of the related after tax expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 25, 2006 was $65.8 million, as compared to $96.4 million in pre tax charges as previously discussed. These additional stock based compensation and other expenses had no effect on the Companys reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or short term investments for each of the restated periods. The Company has also restated the pro forma amortization of deferred stock based employee compensation included in reported net income, net of tax, and total stock based employee compensation expenses determined under fair value based method, net of tax, under SFAS No. 123 in Note 14, Equity Based Compensation Plans to Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect the effect of the stock based compensation expense resulting from the correction of these past stock option grants. 39 Table of Contents As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all employees, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of the Companys 2007 Form 10 K.

The Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously reported financial statements for fiscal years 1996 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paid in capital, deferred stock based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27, 2004. Late SEC Filings and NASDAQ Delisting Proceedings On August 27, 2007, the Company received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of its 2007 Form 10 K, the Company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On November 7, 2007, the Company received an additional letter from NASDAQ of similar substance related to its First Quarter 2008 Form 10 Q. On January 14, 2008, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted the Companys request for continued listing, provided that it filed a written summary of the Independent Committees findings with NASDAQ, as well as the 2007 Form 10 K and First Quarter 2008 Form 10 Q on or before February 13, 2007. On February 5, 2008, the Company received an additional letter from NASDAQ stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of its Second Quarter 2008 Form 10 Q, the Company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On February 8, 2008, the Company received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings Review Council that advised the Company that any delisting determination by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel had been stayed pending further review by the Review Council. The Company was given until March 28, 2008 to submit additional information to assist the Review Council in its assessment of the Companys listing status. On February 12, 2008, the Company filed a written summary of the Independent Committees findings with NASDAQ. The Company believes that the filing of this 2007 Form 10 K, together with the expected filing of the First Quarter 2008 Form 10 Q and the Second Quarter 2008 Form 10 Q, with the SEC will remediate the Companys non compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), subject to NASDAQs affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to the Company accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with the Companys position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which the financial effect of past stock option grants have been accounted for and reported, or not reported, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of the Companys Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 41 Table of Contents Costs of Restatement and Legal Activities During the first two quarters of fiscal year 2008, the Company incurred expenses totaling approximately $9.5 million for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connection with the Independent Committees review, the Companys own internal review and recertification procedures, the preparation of the June 24, 2007 consolidated financial statements and the restated consolidated financial statements. There were no such expenses incurred as a result of the stock option review during fiscal year 2007. Shareholder Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices We, and our current and former directors and officers, may become the subject of government inquiries, shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future. We have received a letter from a stockholder demanding that our Board of Directors take certain actions, including potentially legal action, in connection with our historical stock option practices, and threatening to sue if our Board of Directors does not comply with the stockholders demands. Our Board of Directors is currently reviewing the letter. We may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits. Should any of these events occur, they could require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. This could divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures. 42 Table of Contents Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions that typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time. The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) and demonstrates the strength of our performance throughout fiscal year 2007: Three Months Ended Year Ended June 24, March 25, December 24, September 24, June 24, 2007 2007 2006 2006 2007 Revenue $ 678,519 $ 650,270 $ 633,400 $ 604,387 $ 2,566,576 Gross margin 342,729 326,245 322,916 313,164 1,305,054 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 50.5 % 50.2 % 51.0 % 51.8 % 50.8 % Net income 170,231 164,741 167,326 183,518 685,816 Diluted net income per share $ 1.28 $ 1.15 $ 1.15 $ 1.27 $ 4.85 Our demonstrated performance and our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product development, sales and marketing, and customer support. We are executing to the near term production requirements of our customers, targeted to expand our leadership position in etch, leverage our etch expertise into adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering best in class financial performance over the long term. Fiscal year 2007 shipments were approximately $2.6 billion. Fiscal year 2007 revenues increased 56% compared to fiscal year 2006 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with positive revenue momentum in all regions. Gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50% for the third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 50.8% compared to fiscal year 2006 gross margin of 50.4%. Our fiscal 2007 performance is demonstrated by the significant increase in operating margin to 30.3% compared with 24.6% in fiscal year 2006, a sequential increase of 92% compared to the 56% growth in revenue. Total operating expenses increased 25% during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006, driven by discretionary investments related to our multi product and adjacent market expansion plans. These investments included increased compensation costs as we expanded our headcount to support our growth plans during fiscal year 2007 by more than 20% to approximately 2,900 employees. Incentive based compensation levels grew consistent with our strong performance in profitability and share price. We also invested in discretionary spending on supplies and materials to support our new product development and customer evaluation activities. Equity based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2007 in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $6.4 million and $29.1 million, respectively compared to $5.4 million and $18.6 million, respectively, in the prior year. The fiscal year 2007 increase reflects the addition of our 2007 restricted stock unit focal grant which was awarded at a higher stock price than the prior year focal grant. Worthy of note is the growth in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal year 2007 which more than doubled from fiscal year 2006 performance to $823.6 million representing approximately 32% of revenues, an increase of 124.2% sequentially. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Three Months Ended Year Ended June 24, March 25, December 24, September 24, June 24, 2007 2007 2006 2006 2007 Shipments (in millions) $ 694 $ 620 $ 645 $ 640 $ 2,599 During fiscal year 2007, 300 mm applications represented approximately 88% of total etch systems shipments, and 94% of etch systems shipments were for applications at less than or equal to the 90 nm technology node. We classify total etch systems shipments market segmentation for fiscal year 2007 as Memory at approximately 73%, Foundry at 15%, and IDM Logic/Other at 12%. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 24, 2007 were approximately $642.6 million. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to Backlog in Part I Item 1, Business of this 2007 Form 10 K for additional information on our backlog policy. 43 Table of Contents Revenue Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 Revenue (in thousands) $ 2,566,576 $ 1,642,171 $ 1,502,453 North America 16 % 14 % 16 % Europe 9 % 13 % 12 % Asia Pacific 18 % 12 % 19 % Taiwan 22 % 17 % 19 % Korea 21 % 22 % 19 % Japan 14 % 22 % 15 % The increase in revenues during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers and our market share expansion. We believe we gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period, with strong revenue performance in Taiwan, China, North America, and Korea during fiscal year 2007 and in Japan and Korea during fiscal year 2006. The increase in revenues was correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continued to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $295.5 million as of June 24, 2007 compared to $229.7 million as of June 25, 2006, as shipments outpaced revenues during fiscal year 2007. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $51 million as of June 24, 2007; these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. Gross Margin Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 As restated (1) As restated (1) (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 1,305,054 $ 827,012 $ 763,464 Percent of total revenue 50.8 % 50.4 % 50.8 % (1) See Note 3 Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements to Consolidated Financial Statements. Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 remained greater than 50% for the third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 50.8% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 was primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources on higher business volumes partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a targeted consumable spare parts price reduction strategy focused on preserving and building market share and strengthening customer trust in our efforts to support their cost reduction roadmaps. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 was affected by the inclusion of equity based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) of $5 million, or 0.3%. The impact of unfavorable product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance, and improved factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes. 44 Table of Contents Research and Development Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 As restated (1) As restated (1) (in thousands, except percentages) Research Development (RD) $ 285,348 $ 229,378 $ 195,289 Percent of total revenue 11.1 % 14.0 % 13.0 % (1) See Note 3 Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading edge plasma etch and our portfolio of new products. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 included expected increases of approximately $22 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, new and product growth objectives, $18 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $6 million in incentive based compensation driven by higher profit levels and $6 million in equity based compensation. Approximately 33% of fiscal year 2007 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately $19 million in increased supplies and outside services, $8 million in increased equity based compensation expense, and $4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 As restated (1) As restated (1) (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General Administrative (SGA) $ 241,046 $ 192,866 $ 165,832 Percent of total revenue 9.4 % 11.7 % 11.0 % (1) See Note 3 Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in SGA expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of $20 million in incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits and stock price, approximately $15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation, and $5 million in equity based compensation. The increase in SGA expenses during fiscal year 2006 compared with the prior year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $4 million due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Increases in incentive based cash compensation of approximately $7 million were principally due to our long term executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equity based compensation was approximately $8 million. Fiscal year 2005 SGA expenses were lower primarily due to the March 2005 receipt of an $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 24, June 25, June 26, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Interest income $ 71,666 $ 38,189 $ 17,537 Interest expense (17,817 ) (677 ) (1,413 ) Foreign exchange loss (1,512 ) (1,458 ) (1,175 ) Debt issue cost amortization (368 ) Equity method investment losses (205 ) Equity method investment impairment (445 ) Gain on sale of other investments 3,000 Charitable contributions (1,500 ) (1,000 ) (5,500 ) Favorable legal judgment 15,834 Other, net (608 ) 336 (679 ) $ 69,063 $ 35,022 $ 8,120 45 Table of Contents The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2007 and to a lesser extent, increases in interest rate yields. Although the average total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances increased throughout the year, the balances at the end of fiscal year 2007 decreased by approximately $490 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to share repurchase activity of approximately $1.1 billion throughout fiscal year 2007, of which approximately $768 million occurred during the June 2007 quarter. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 was due to the $350 million of long term debt entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary on June 16, 2006 to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The balance of our long term debt was $250 million as of June 24, 2007. In June 2007 we recognized a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of a private equity investment. The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by the Company alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of its customers. The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam Research during the quarter ended September 24, 2006. The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short term securities, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. The Companys total balances of cash, cash equivalents, short term securities, and restricted cash and investments, increased approximately $626 million from fiscal year 2005. This increase included the Companys wholly owned subsidiarys drawdown against a $350 million Credit Agreement to support the Companys foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the AJCA. The remaining increase of $276 million was primarily driven by $367 million from cash flows from operating activities. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $161.9 million, $104.6 million and $99.0 million, in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 19.1%, 23.8% and 25.0%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2007 was due to the change in the geographical mix of income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate as well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million, or 2.5% benefit on the effective tax rate. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of the Companys U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research credit as it pertains to the Companys fiscal year 2006. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings. The fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate was 23.8%, compared to the fiscal year 2005 effective tax rate of 25.0%, and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate, the realization of state RD tax credits not previously benefited, favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bilateral advanced pricing arrangement. These favorable adjustments for the year were partially offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a $500 million extraordinary dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, combined with the impact of the accounting for equity based awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions, and the expiration of the research tax credit on December 31, 2005. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $123.3 million and $133.3 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $34.2 million and $27.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the utilization of tax credits, adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of income tax returns in various jurisdictions, the impact of certain elections related to foreign tax rulings, the conclusion of negotiations on certain transfer pricing items, and the incremental tax benefit related to stock based compensation deductions. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which approximate actual costs on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Generally, obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. 47 Table of Contents In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity based Compensation Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans: We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in paid in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid in capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under APB No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid in capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R. In connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements, we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to select for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement is set forth above in Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements and in Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level of RD spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Companys expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operation and financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually. In addition, we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. 48 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we expect to decrease the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million as well as reclass approximately $64.4 million from current to non current income taxes payable. We expect the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 to be a $17.6 million increase to our opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 157 on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 159 beginning June 30, 2008 and are currently evaluating the impact that this pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R beginning in fiscal year 2010 and are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on our consolidated financial statements. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 24, 2007, we had approximately $1.0 billion in gross cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments compared with $1.5 billion at June 25, 2006. During fiscal year 2007, we generated $823.6 million in cash from operating activities, which supported the use of $1.1 billion in stock repurchases, $177.1 million to fund the acquisition of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. (Bullen), and $100.0 million repayment of our long term debt. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $823.6 million during fiscal year 2007 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 685.8 Non cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 38.1 Equity based compensation 35.6 Net tax benefit on equity based compensation plans 17.4 Deferred income taxes 17.1 Change in other working capital accounts 29.0 Other 0.6 $ 823.6 Significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred profit of $51.1 million due to increased volume of shipments, $44.8 million in accrued expenses primarily due to increased incentive based compensation on higher profit levels, and an increase in accounts payable of $9.1 million. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in inventories of $56.3 million on increased business volume, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $19.2 million on a pre tax basis due to certain supply arrangement and taxes receivable. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2007 was $82.8 million and included the acquisition of Bullen assets of $177.1 million and capital expenditures of $60.0 million partially offset by the reclassification of $110.0 million from restricted cash and investments due to the repayment of $100.0 million of our long term debt and $45.2 million in net sales of short term investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2007 was $1.1 billion in total reflecting $1.1 billion of stock repurchases thereby completing all available share repurchase authorizations. We also made payments on our long term debt and capital leases of $100.2 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were $60.6 million from the issuance of our Common Stock related to employee equity based plans, and $45.0 million of excess tax benefit on equity based compensation plans which represents the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in RD and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 24, 2007 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. 50 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include our long term debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. Our off balance sheet arrangements include certain contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our combined contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table as of June 24, 2007: Long term Operating Purchase Debt and Leases Obligations Interest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 86,543 $ 178,815 $ 13,851 $ 279,209 1 3 years 6,117 62,253 27,401 95,771 3 5 years 1,745 29,792 263,738 295,275 Over 5 years 1,743 39,273 41,016 Total $ 96,148 $ 310,133 $ 304,990 $ 711,271 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, RD and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the operating leases less than 1 year section of the table above is $75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest bearing accounts that are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and is therefore not consolidated by us. We obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided in the lease agreements. Please see additional information in Subsequent Events below regarding renewal of the leases noted above and entry into additional leases. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non cancelable facility related operating leases. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2007 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses and properly segregated and controlled, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 24, 2007, vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $27.4 million. 51 Table of Contents Long Term Debt and Interest Expense On June 16, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the LRI Credit Agreement). Under the LRI Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under the LRI Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (applicable margin) ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit Agreement. LRI may prepay the loan under the LRI Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the remaining principal payment of $250 million due on June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated based on the current LIBOR rate in effect as of June 24, 2007 of 5.320% and applicable margin of ten basis points. $100.0 million of the original $350.0 million debt was repaid during fiscal year 2007. The fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. Please see additional information under Subsequent Events below regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and our entry into a new credit agreement. We used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate a portion of the repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006 under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We lease several facilities at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. As part of certain of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessors costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest bearing accounts that are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and is therefore not consolidated by us. We obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided in the lease agreements. Please see additional information under Subsequent Events below for renewal of the leases noted above and entry into additional leases. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2007, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. On June 16, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary, LRI, as borrower, entered into the $350 million LRI Credit Agreement. In connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, representing $275.0 million at June 24, 2007 as we had paid down $100.0 million of the existing debt during fiscal year 2007. This collateral is reflected in the balance of restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We obtained compliance waivers from the lender with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lender under the terms provided in the Guarantee Agreement. Please see additional information under Subsequent Events below regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement, our entry into a new credit agreement, and the entry of our wholly owned subsidiary Bullen Semiconductor Corporation into a new guarantee agreement with respect to the new credit agreement. Generally, we indemnify, under pre determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. 52 Table of Contents Subsequent Events SEZ Transaction: On March 11, 2008, we completed the tender offer for the outstanding shares of SEZ Holding AG (SEZ), the leading supplier of single wafer clean technology and products to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. Upon the completion of the tender, we acquired approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of SEZ. We expect to take additional steps as necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding. The tender offer was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered into on December 10, 2007 by and between the Company and SEZ (the Transaction Agreement). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, we acquired all shares of SEZ that were tendered in the offer at a price of CHF 38 per share in cash, for a total price of CHF 606 million, which approximated US$584 million. In December 2007, we purchased a call option with a notional amount of approximately CHF 641 million to hedge the currency exposure in connection with the anticipated purchase of the shares of SEZ as noted above. The call option premium cost was $10.3 million. The mark to market value of the fair value of the call option as of December 23, 2007 was $3.1 million resulting in a $7.2 million unrealized loss recorded in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended December 23, 2007. In February 2008 we extended the expiration date of the call option at an additional premium cost of $2.4 million. We exercised the call option during March 2008 which resulted in a gain of $40.7 million which we will record in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ending March 30, 2008. Operating Leases: On December 18, 2007, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the Livermore Leases) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the New Fremont Leases, and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the Operating Leases) with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off balance sheet arrangement. The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by us and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (BNPPLC). Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven year term (inclusive of an initial construction period during which BNPPLCs and our obligations will be governed by the Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the Livermore Leases are estimated to be approximately $25.7 million in the aggregate (based on one month LIBOR rates at the time of entering into the leases), following completion of improvements to each property. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven year term ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the New Fremont Leases are approximately $32.4 million in the aggregate (based upon three month LIBOR rates at the time of entering into the leases). Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLCs investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment. We are required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion of the Livermore construction) in separate interest bearing accounts with BNPPLC (or a third party, currently State Street Bank and Trust, with regard to the Livermore Leases) as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases. Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8 million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of BNPPLCs investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations). Under each Operating Lease and its associated documents, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash, unencumbered cash investments, and unencumbered marketable securities of at least $300.0 million (not including the collateral maintained as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases). The Operating Leases are subject to customary default provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the Operating Leases and associated documents, payment defaults under other indebtedness of us, performance defaults under the Operating Leases (including cross defaults between each of the Operating Leases), and events of bankruptcy. In the event that such defaults occur and are continuing, BNPPLC may accelerate repayment of a portion or all of its investment under the applicable Operating Leases; alternatively, BNPPLC may require us to pay all amounts due under one or more Operating Leases through the end of the term of the applicable Operating Leases. 53 Table of Contents Credit Agreements: On March 3, 2008, we, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2008 (the Credit Agreement) with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the Agent), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and such lenders. Bullen Semiconductor Corporation, our wholly owned domestic subsidiary(Bullen), entered into a guarantee (the Bullen Guarantee) to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we and Bullen entered into certain collateral documents (collectively, the Collateral Documents) including a Security Agreement by us (the Security Agreement), a Security Agreement by Bullen (the Bullen Security Agreement), a Pledge Agreement by us (the Pledge Agreement) and other Collateral Documents to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber current and future accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and related assets of us and Bullen, as well as 100% of our ownership interest in Bullen and 65% of our ownership interest in Lam Research International BV, our wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, any future domestic subsidiaries of us will also enter into a similar guarantee and collateral documents to encumber the foregoing type of assets. Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non revolving term loan with the following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agents prime rate. We may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum EBITDA). As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million) under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents. Section 409A: As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all employees, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of the Companys 2007 Form 10 K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long term debt. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006: June 25, June 24, 2007 2006 Fiscal Year Ending June 29, June 28, June 27, June 26, June 24, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 There after Total Fair Value Total (in thousands, except percentages) Cash equivalents Principal Amount with variable rate Money Market Fund $ 529,968 $ 529,968 $ 529,968 730,887 Average rate 5.24 % 5.24 % 4.95 % Principal Amount with fixed rate Securities $ $ 113,566 Average rate 5.10 % Short term investment Principal Amount with fixed rate $ 30,636 $ 28,829 $ 15,761 $ 6,979 $ 8,482 $ 6,859 $ 97,546 $ 96,724 142,331 Average rate 4.68 % 4.98 % 4.69 % 5.16 % 5.07 % 4.64 % 4.85 % 4.19 % Restricted Cash/Investments Principal Amount with fixed rate Time Deposit $ 85,038 $ 85,038 $ 85,038 Average rate 5.25 % 5.25 % Principal Amount with variable rate Auction Rate Notes/VRDN $ 12,100 $ 1,000 $ 13,100 $ 13,096 70,575 Average rate (taxable equivalent yield) 3.87 % 5.73 % 4.24 % 5.64 % Principal Amount with fixed rate Restricted Securities $ 50,696 $ 96,759 $ 65,231 $ 28,992 $ 16,610 $ 4,869 $ 263,157 $ 261,904 400,450 Average rate (taxable equivalent yield) 3.67 % 3.00 % 3.66 % 3.82 % 3.89 % 4.53 % 3.68 % 5.12 % Total investment securities $ 708,438 $ 126,588 $ 80,992 $ 35,971 $ 25,092 $ 11,728 $ 988,809 $ 986,730 1,457,809 Average rate 4.45 % 3.91 % 3.86 % 4.08 % 4.29 % 4.60 % 4.27 % 4.41 % Long term debt Variable rate $ $ $ $ 250,000 $ $ $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ 350,000 Average rate 5.42 % 5.42 % 5.65 % 54 Table of Contents The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2007 are as follows: Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points June 24, 2007 Increase of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) U.S. Treasury $ 3,003 $ 2,969 $ 2,936 $ 2,902 $ 2,869 $ 2,835 $ 2,801 Government Sponsored Entity 21,697 21,583 21,470 21,356 21,242 21,129 21,015 Corporate 208,737 207,750 206,763 205,776 204,788 203,800 202,813 Municipal 232,389 230,502 228,615 226,728 224,841 222,954 221,067 $ 465,826 $ 462,804 $ 459,784 $ 456,762 $ 453,740 $ 450,718 $ 447,696 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen denominated assets and forecasted Japanese yen denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our Balance Sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen denominated net receivable balances. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 24, 2007, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $30.2 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June 24, 2007, was $0.1 million. As of June 24, 2007, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the Japanese yen would result in a potential loss in fair value of our balance sheet hedge forward contracts of $3.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 24, 2007, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $77.6 million. As of June 24, 2007, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the Japanese yen would result in a potential loss in fair value of our cash flow hedge forward contracts of $7.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Our outstanding long term debt of $250.0 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the LRI Credit Agreement is 0.10%. The principal payment of $250 million is due on June 19, 2011. The fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. Please see additional information under Subsequent Events regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and our entry into a new credit agreement. 55 Table of Contents
