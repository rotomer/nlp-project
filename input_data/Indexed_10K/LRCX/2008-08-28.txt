Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this 2008 Form 10 K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this 2008 Form 10 K ). The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Todays leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2008 Form 10 K. MDA consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated and standalone processing solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages): Three Months Ended Year Ended Year Ended June 29, March 30, December 23, September 23, June 29, June 24, 2008 2008 2007 2007 2008 2007 Revenue $ 566,160 $ 613,810 $ 610,320 $ 684,621 $ 2,474,911 $ 2,566,576 Gross margin 234,650 287,208 307,661 343,887 1,173,406 1,305,054 Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 41.4 % 46.8 % 50.4 % 50.2 % 47.4 % 50.8 % Net income 72,178 103,524 115,059 148,588 439,349 685,816 Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.57 $ 0.82 $ 0.91 $ 1.18 $ 3.47 $ 4.85 Our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product and process development, sales and marketing, and customer support. Although there are near term challenges from declining customer investment levels, we continue to target to expand our leadership position in etch, leverage our etch expertise into adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering best in class financial performance over the long term. Fiscal year 2008 shipments were approximately $2.4 billion. Fiscal year 2008 revenues decreased 4% compared to fiscal year 2007 revenues reflecting a reduction in customer demand in the latter portion of the year. 27 Table of Contents Gross margin as a percent of revenues was 47.4% for fiscal year 2008 and decreased sequentially compared to fiscal year 2007 gross margin of 50.8%. This reduction was primarily due to customer concentration and product mix challenges and decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer investment levels. Fiscal year 2008 operating expenses include the assumption of Section 409A employee liabilities of $43.8 million and $19.3 million of costs related to our voluntary internal stock option review. Included in operating expenses is $29.5 million from the operations of SEZ since the date of acquisition. We also continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading edge plasma etch, single wafer clean, and other new products and technologies. Although there are near term pressures on our business from declining customer investment levels, we are targeting the longer term benefit of our product development activities. These factors, along with decreased revenues and gross margins noted above, contributed to the fiscal 2008 operating margin decrease to 20.6% compared with 30.3% in fiscal year 2007. Our cash performance remained strong during fiscal year 2008 as our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased sequentially during fiscal year 2008 by $174.1 million after the cash acquisition of SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. Cash flows from operating activities were $590.3 million during fiscal year 2008. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Three Months Ended Year Ended June 29, March 30, December 23, September 23, June 29, 2008 2008 2007 2007 2008 Shipments (in millions) $ 495 $ 658 $ 593 $ 621 $ 2,367 North America 13 % 15 % 17 % 18 % 16 % Europe 9 % 7 % 13 % 7 % 9 % Asia Pacific 15 % 14 % 13 % 12 % 13 % Taiwan 15 % 19 % 19 % 26 % 20 % Korea 22 % 28 % 19 % 20 % 22 % Japan 26 % 17 % 19 % 17 % 20 % Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 29, 2008 were approximately $410 million and decreased from approximately $643 million as of June 24, 2007 consistent with reduced spending commitments of our customers in the semiconductor industry. The basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to Backlog in Part I Item 1, Business of this 2008 Form 10 K for additional information on our backlog policy. 28 Table of Contents Revenue Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 Revenue (in thousands) $ 2,474,911 $ 2,566,576 $ 1,642,171 North America 17 % 16 % 14 % Europe 10 % 9 % 13 % Asia Pacific 13 % 18 % 12 % Taiwan 20 % 22 % 17 % Korea 22 % 21 % 22 % Japan 18 % 14 % 22 % The slight decrease in revenues during fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 reflects our customers response to balancing supply and demand in the semiconductor industry. The increase in revenues during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers and our market share expansion. Our revenue levels are correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continued to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region. Our deferred revenue balance decreased to $193.6 million as of June 29, 2008 compared to $295.5 million as of June 24, 2007, consistent with the decline in customer spending levels during fiscal year 2008. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $52 million as of June 29, 2008; these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. Gross Margin Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Margin $ 1,173,406 $ 1,305,054 $ 827,012 Percent of total revenue 47.4 % 50.8 % 50.4 % Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2008 was 47.4%. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes, as well as customer concentration and product mix challenges, $12.6 million of one time restructuring and asset impairment expenses related to the streamlining of our combined clean product group, post SEZ acquisition, and $6.4 million of expense associated with the assumption of the employee tax liabilities as a result of the determinations from our voluntary independent stock option review. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 was primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources on higher business volumes partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a targeted consumable spare parts price reduction strategy focused on preserving and building market share and strengthening customer trust in our efforts to support their cost reduction roadmaps. Research and Development Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Research Development (RD) $ 323,759 $ 285,348 $ 229,378 Percent of total revenue 13.1 % 11.1 % 14.0 % 29 Table of Contents Although there are near term pressures on our business from declining customer investment levels, given the targeted longer term benefit of our product development activities, we continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading edge plasma etch, single wafer clean, and new products and technologies. The fiscal year 2008 RD expenses included approximately $14 million from the operations of SEZ. Including SEZ since March 11, 2008, the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 reflect our commitment towards our near term and longer term product growth objectives and included increases of approximately $22 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $9 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, and new product growth objectives, and a $3 million decrease in incentive based compensation driven by reduced profit levels. Approximately 74% and 33% of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 systems revenues, respectively, were derived from products introduced over the previous two years and is reflective of our continued investments in new products and technologies. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 included expected increases of approximately $22 million in engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, new and product growth objectives, $18 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $6 million in incentive based compensation driven by higher profit levels and $6 million in equity based compensation. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, General Administrative (SGA) $ 287,992 $ 241,046 $ 192,866 Percent of total revenue 11.6 % 9.4 % 11.7 % Fiscal year 2008 SGA expenses included approximately $15 million of SEZ SGA expenses. The increase in SGA expenses during fiscal year 2008 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of approximately $24 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount, including SEZ since March 11, 2008, and employee base compensation, $19 million in legal and accounting cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option review, and $3 million in equity based compensation partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in incentive based compensation triggered by lower profit levels. The increase in SGA expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven by increases of $20 million in incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits and stock price, approximately $15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation, and $5 million in equity based compensation. 409A Expense As a result of the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review, we considered the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC, these options are subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Due to this, taxes and penalties are levied not on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain for exercised options. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume the tax liability of certain employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. The 409A liability totaled $50.2 million; $43.8 million was recorded in operating expenses and $6.4 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2008. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements to Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of our 2007 Form 10 K. In Process Research and Development We incurred a charge of $2.1 million related to the required expensing of in process research and development following our acquisition of SEZ which is reported in operating expenses during fiscal year 2008. There remains no additional in process research and development on our balance sheet. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During the June 2008 quarter we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of our combined clean product group (June 2008 Plan). These charges included severance and related benefits costs, excess facilities related costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line integration road maps. 30 Table of Contents Prior to the end of the June 2008 quarter, we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific actions under the June 2008 Plan. Severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on managements estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned. We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product, facility, or service. We recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2008 of approximately $19.0 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $5.5 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $0.9 million, and the write off of related fixed assets of $1.9 million. We also recorded asset impairments related to initial product line integration road maps of $10.7 million. Of the total $19.0 million in charges, $12.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and $6.4 million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2008 consolidated statement of operations. As a result of the fiscal year 2008 restructuring activities, we expect annual savings, relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of approximately $25 million. These estimated savings from the June 2008 Plans discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2008 Plan: Severance and Abandoned Benefits Facilities Fixed Assets Inventory Total (in thousands) June 2008 provision $ 5,513 $ 899 $ 1,893 $ 10,671 $ 18,976 Cash payments (927 ) (927 ) Non cash charges (1,893 ) (10,671 ) (12,564 ) Balance at June 29, 2008 $ 4,586 $ 899 $ $ $ 5,485 The severance and benefits related costs are anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2009. The facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2009. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 29, June 24, June 25, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Interest income $ 51,194 $ 71,666 $ 38,189 Interest expense (12,674 ) (17,817 ) (677 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses) 31,070 (1,512 ) (1,458 ) Debt issue cost amortization (368 ) Gain on sale of other investments 3,000 Charitable contributions (908 ) (1,500 ) (1,000 ) Favorable legal judgment 15,834 Other, net (1,137 ) (608 ) 336 $ 67,545 $ 69,063 $ 35,022 31 Table of Contents The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2008 compared with the prior year is primarily due to decreases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2008 and to a lesser extent, decreases in interest rate yields. The decrease in average balances was due to share repurchase activity of $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2007, of which $768.0 million was repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, and the acquisition of SEZ in fiscal year 2008 in the amount of $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short term securities, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2008 as compared with the prior year was due to a $100 million repayment on our long term debt during the December and March quarters of fiscal year 2007 and a decline in interest rates. The balance of our long term debt and capital lease obligations as of June 29, 2008 was $306.3 million. The current portion of long term debt and capital leases was $30.2 million as of June 29, 2008. Consolidated debt and capital lease obligations increased during fiscal year 2008 as a result of the SEZ acquisition. Debt and capital lease balances related to the SEZ acquisition were $56.3 million in total with $5.2 million representing the current portion as of June 29, 2008. The debt obligations consist of various bank loans and government grants supporting operating needs and capital leases reflect building lease obligations. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 as compared with fiscal year 2006 was due to the $350 million of long term debt entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary on June 16, 2006 to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The balance of our long term debt was $250 million as of June 24, 2007. Included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 are gains associated with the acquisition of SEZ of $42.7 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the Swiss franc. These acquisition related net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign exchange losses of approximately $11.2 million during fiscal year 2008 which were primarily due to our foreign currency denominated liabilities with non U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar weakened against certain currencies, primarily the Euro and Taiwan dollar resulting in the foreign exchange loss. A description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be found in the Risk Factors section of this 2008 Form 10 K under the heading Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations. In June 2007 we recognized a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of a private equity investment. The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers. The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam Research during the quarter ended September 24, 2006. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $137.6 million, $161.9 million, and $104.6 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 23.9%, 19.1%, and 23.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2008 is primarily due to the application of certain foreign tax rulings, a decrease in the proportion of income in low tax jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the federal research tax credit which expired on December 31, 2007. The increase was partially offset by certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $11.6 million. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled. The fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate was 19.1%, compared to the fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate of 23.8%, and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate as well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns, the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research credit as it pertains to our fiscal year 2006. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $173.0 million and $123.3 million at the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $53.1 million and $34.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $3.4 million at the end of fiscal year 2008. There was no such valuation allowance at the end of fiscal year 2007. 32 Table of Contents Deferred tax assets increased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the accrual related to the Section 409A employee liability and the deferred tax assets from the acquisition of SEZ. The increase in deferred tax liability in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the acquisition of SEZ. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $3.4 million relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the SEZ acquisition. Any subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in the SEZ acquisition will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. FIN 48 In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we decreased the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million as well as reclassed approximately $64.4 million from current to non current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a $17.6 million increase to our opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent 33 Table of Contents upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Inventory Valuation : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance. Standard costs are reassessed as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Warranty : Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system by system basis. Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis, and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable. Equity based Compensation Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans : We account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in paid in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid in capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting Principles Board No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid in capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects our underlying profitability, the level of RD spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. We adopted FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2008. See Note 15: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2008 Form 10 K for further discussion. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. Should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we perform the impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our 35 Table of Contents reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by corporate headquarters. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit over its estimated remaining useful life. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our and our competitors market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. The value assigned to intangible assets is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company decreased the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million, and reclassed approximately $64.4 million from current to non current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted in an increase to the Companys opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 of approximately $17.6 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. We will adopt the delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 during fiscal year 2010, while all other portions of the standard will be adopted during fiscal year 2009, as required. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that fiscal year. Our financial assets and liabilities impacted by SFAS No. 157 relate primarily to derivatives, short term investments and restricted investments balances. We do not believe there will be any material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. We do not believe there will be any material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 159. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting 36 Table of Contents standards for the treatment of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 will result in the reclassification of minority interests to stockholders equity. We are currently assessing any further impacts of SFAS 160 on our results of operations and financial condition. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities An Amendment of FASB Statement 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires expanded and enhanced disclosure for derivative instruments, including those used in hedging activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS 161 on our consolidated financial statement disclosures. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP SFAS 142 3). FSP SFAS 142 3 provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the renewal or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets. FSP SFAS 142 3 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of FSP SFAS 142 3 on our results of operations and financial condition. Liquidity and Capital Resources During fiscal year 2008 we grew our gross cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments balance to $1.2 billion compared with $1.0 billion at June 24, 2007. During fiscal year 2008, we generated $590.3 million in cash from operating activities. In addition, we acquired SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired, in an all cash transaction. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $590.3 million during fiscal year 2008 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 439.3 Non cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 54.7 Equity based compensation 42.5 Net gain on settlement of call option (33.8 ) Restructuring charges, net 19.0 Net tax benefit on equity based compensation plans 24.6 Deferred income taxes (26.7 ) Changes in operating asset accounts 74.0 Other (3.3 ) $ 590.3 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts , net of amounts acquired from SEZ, included the following sources of cash: a decrease in accounts receivable of $99.9 million on lower business volumes, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $80.6 million that was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation, including an accrual for the assumption of 409A liabilities of $50.2 million, and a decrease in inventories of $19.7 million on lower business volumes. These sources of cash were partially offset by decreases in deferred profit and accounts payable of $64.0 million and $40.1 million, respectively, on lower business volumes, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $22.0 million primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2008 was $495.8 million which was primarily due to our acquisition of SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, our capital expenditures were $76.8 million and we purchased Swiss franc call options related to the acquisition of SEZ totaling $13.5 million. These expenditures were partially offset by net sales/maturities of investments of $18.8 million, proceeds from the settlement of the call options related to the SEZ acquisition of $47.3 million and the reclassification of restricted cash of $15.5 million. 37 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2008 was $65.8 million which was primarily due to $58.9 million of excess tax benefit on equity based compensation plans representing the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized, $21.3 million from the issuance of our Common Stock related to employee equity based plans, partially offset by $14.6 million in share repurchases related to shares withheld through net share settlements upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our equity compensation plans. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in RD and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 29, 2008 are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include our long term debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. Our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $109.5 million of liabilities under FIN 48 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15, Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Long term Operating Capital Purchase Debt and Leases Leases Obligations Interest Expense Total (in thousands) Payments due by period: Less than 1 year $ 12,594 $ 1,864 $ 142,651 $ 38,828 $ 195,937 1 3 years 18,533 5,936 49,311 248,337 322,117 3 5 years 12,661 4,516 31,727 13,195 62,099 Over 5 years 150,243 16,697 41,054 207,994 Total $ 194,031 $ 29,013 $ 264,743 $ 300,360 $ 788,147 Operating Leases We lease most of our administrative, RD and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2016. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. Included in the Operating Leases Over 5 years section of the table above is $141.8 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont, California campus and properties in Livermore, California. On December 18, 2007, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the Livermore Leases) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the New Fremont Leases, and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the Operating Leases) with regard to certain improved properties at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off balance sheet arrangement. The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by us and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (BNPPLC). 38 Table of Contents Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven year term (inclusive of an initial construction period during which BNPPLCs and our obligations will be governed by the Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven year term ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLCs investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment. We will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion of the Livermore construction) in separate interest bearing accounts and or eligible short term investments as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases. As of June 29, 2008, we had $129.2 million recorded as restricted cash and short term investments in our consolidated balance sheet as collateral required under the lease agreements related to the amounts currently outstanding on the facility. Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8 million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of BNPPLCs investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations). The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and is therefore not consolidated by us. The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non cancelable facility related operating leases. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of SEZ. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 29, 2008 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 29, 2008, vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $26.5 million. Long Term Debt On June 16, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the LRI Credit Agreement). In connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. The outstanding balance on the loan was repaid in full during the quarter ended March 30, 2008. Concurrent with the repayment of the LRI Credit Agreement noted above, on March 3, 2008, we, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2008 (the Credit Agreement) with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the Agent), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and such lenders. Our wholly owned domestic subsidiary entered into a guarantee for the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company and its wholly owned domestic subsidiary entered into certain collateral documents (collectively, the Collateral Documents) including certain Security Agreements, a Pledge Agreement and other Collateral Documents to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber certain current and future accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and related assets. 39 Table of Contents Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non revolving term loan with the following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agents prime rate. We may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum EBITDA). As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million) under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents. Consolidated debt obligations increased slightly as a result of the SEZ acquisition by $34.8 million of which $4.6 million represents the current portion of long term debt and $30.2 million is classified as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. The debt obligations consist of various bank loans and government grants supporting operating needs. Our total long term debt of $284.8 million as of June 29, 2008 includes the $250.0 million discussed above and $34.8 million from SEZ. The current portion of long term debt was $29.6 million as of June 29, 2008. Guarantees We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also requires a company (the guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2008, we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees. Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre determined conditions and limitations, its customers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by the Companys products or services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees. The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 29, 2008, these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Fixed Income Securities Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long term debt. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29,2008 are as follows: 40 Table of Contents Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Decrease of X Basis Points June 29, 2008 Rate Increase of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 150,712 $ 149,525 $ 148,341 $ 147,157 $ 145,974 $ 144,790 $ 143,605 U.S. Treasury and Agencies 40,064 39,841 39,617 39,393 39,169 38,945 38,721 Government Sponsored Enterprises 21,744 21,539 21,333 21,127 20,921 20,715 20,509 Bank and Corporate Notes 263,750 262,929 262,108 261,288 260,467 259,646 258,825 Total $ 476,270 $ 473,834 $ 471,399 $ 468,965 $ 466,531 $ 464,096 $ 461,660 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Publicly Traded Equity Securities and Equity Mutual Funds The values of our equity investments in publicly traded equity securities and equity mutual funds are subject to equity price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded equity security and equity mutual funds as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, 25% were selected based on potential near term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29, 2008 are as follows: Valuation of Securities Given an X% Decrease in Stock Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an X% Price June 29, 2008 Increase in Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Equity Mutual Funds $ 2,481 $ 2,812 $ 2,977 $ 3,306 $ 3,637 $ 3,802 $ 4,133 Publicly Traded Equity Securities $ 2,542 $ 2,881 $ 3,050 $ 3,389 $ 3,728 $ 3,897 $ 4,236 Foreign Currency Derivatives We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen denominated net assets and forecasted Japanese yen denominated revenue and also on U.S. dollar denominated assets where the Euro is the functional currency. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen denominated revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen denominated net receivable balances against the U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar denominated net receivable balances against the Euro. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of June 29, 2008 is shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of / 10 percent and / 15 percent. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. 41 Table of Contents Unrealized Gain/(Loss) as of FX Contract Change in Fair Value Given an X% Increase () Notional Amount June 29, 2008 / Decrease ( ) in Each FX Rate / 10% / 15% (in millions) Balance sheet hedge forward contracts sold $ 80.1 $ (0.8 ) / $ 7.4 / $ 11.2 The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges as of June 29, 2008 is shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of / 10 percent and / 15 percent. Unrealized FX Contract Change in Fair Value Given an X% Increase () Notional Amount Gain/(Loss) as of / Decrease ( ) in Each FX Rate / 10% / 15% (in millions) Cash flow hedge forward contracts sold $ 107.7 $ 5.9 / $ 10.8 / $ 16.2 Long Term Debt Our long term debt consists of $250 million in a non revolving term loan with the following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agents prime rate. We may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. At any time a sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on interest expense and a material favorable effect on interest expense with a sharp decline in interest rates. A hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate long term debt of 50 basis points would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $1.3 million per fiscal year. In addition, our long term debt includes $3.8 million of variable rate debt based on local LIBOR rates plus a spread of 0.50% and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates.
