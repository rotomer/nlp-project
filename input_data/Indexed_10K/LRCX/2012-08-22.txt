Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this 2012 Form 10 K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this 2012 Form 10 K). Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2012 Form 10 K. MD&A consists of the following sections: Executive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our managements assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. Results of Operations provides an analysis of operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. Executive Summary We design, manufacture, market, refurbish, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make DRAM, flash memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of consumer and industrial electronics. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. The semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic and pronounced changes in customer demand resulting in industry downturns and upturns. Todays leading indicators of change in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), supply, demand, prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations during any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Demand for our products declined in fiscal year 2012 as semiconductor device manufacturers slowed the pace of their capacity expansions in response to weaker macroeconomic conditions impacting demand for certain semiconductor devices. In spite of the slowing pace of capacity expansion, particularly in the memory segment, our customers continued to invest in leading edge technologies over this period. We believe that, over the long term, demand for our products will increase as customers capital expenditures rise to meet growing demand for semiconductor devices, particularly in mobile markets, and address the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing. The following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Revenue $ 2,665,192 $ 3,237,693 $ 2,133,776 $ (572,501 ) 17.7 % $ 1,103,917 51.7 % Gross margin 1,084,069 1,497,232 969,935 $ (413,163 ) 27.6 % $ 527,297 54.4 % Gross margin as a percent of total revenue 40.7 % 46.2 % 45.5 % 5.5 % 0.7 % Total operating expenses 846,336 692,947 544,525 $ 153,389 22.1 % $ 148,422 27.3 % Net income 168,723 723,748 346,669 $ (555,025 ) 76.7 % $ 377,079 108.8 % Diluted net income per share $ 1.35 $ 5.79 $ 2.71 $ (4.44 ) 76.7 % $ 3.08 113.7 % On June 4, 2012 we completed our acquisition of Novellus Systems, Inc (Novellus). Results for fiscal year 2012 include Novellus operations from the acquisition date through June 24, 2012. Lams primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue and cost synergies. Fiscal year 2012 revenues decreased 18% compared to fiscal year 2011, primarily reflecting the decrease in customer capacity investments as noted above. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and less favorable customer and product mix. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily related to continued investments in next generation research and development and the customer facing activities that surround and support it and costs associated with the Novellus acquisition and integration. 25 Table of Contents Our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $3.0 billion as of June 24, 2012 compared to $2.3 billion as of June 26, 2011. This increase included the impact of $1.1 billion acquired in connection with the Novellus acquisition, offset by $773 million of share repurchases. We generated approximately $499 million in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $881 million in fiscal year 2011. The decreased operating cash flows in fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2011 were primarily a result of lower revenue, increased investments in research and development, and costs related to the Novellus acquisition. Results of Operations Shipments and Backlog Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 Shipments (in millions) $ 2,672 $ 3,306 $ 2,304 Korea 36 % 21 % 27 % Taiwan 18 % 23 % 32 % North America 17 % 13 % 8 % Asia Pacific 11 % 17 % 11 % Japan 10 % 13 % 15 % Europe 8 % 13 % 7 % Shipments for fiscal year 2012 were approximately $2.7 billion and decreased by 19% compared to fiscal year 2011. Shipments for fiscal year 2011 were approximately $3.3 billion and increased by 43% compared to fiscal year 2010. The decrease in shipments during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 related to change in demand for semiconductor equipment, especially in the first half of fiscal year 2012. The increase in shipments from fiscal year 2010 to 2011 reflects improvements in the industry and economic environments. During fiscal year 2012, applications at or below the 45 nanometer technology node were 93% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2011, applications at or below the 65 nanometer technology node were 90% of total systems shipments. During fiscal year 2012 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 45%, 46% and 9% of system shipments, respectively. During fiscal year 2011 the memory market segment, foundry segment, and logic/integrated device manufacturing segment were approximately 49%, 32% and 19% of system shipments, respectively. Starting with the December 2011 quarter we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic/integrated device manufacturing category. Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 24, 2012 were approximately $870 million and increased from approximately $641 million as of June 26, 2011. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. Please refer to Backlog in Part I Item 1, Business of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. Revenue Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 Revenue (in millions) $ 2,665 $ 3,238 $ 2,134 Korea 33 % 23 % 25 % Taiwan 18 % 24 % 33 % North America 17 % 12 % 9 % Japan 12 % 13 % 15 % Asia Pacific 11 % 15 % 12 % Europe 9 % 13 % 6 % The revenue decrease in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was due to the decrease in customer capacity investments. The revenue increase during fiscal year 2011 compared to 2010 reflected improvements in the industry and economic environments. Our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to 26 Table of Contents occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $335.4 million as of June 24, 2012 compared to $257.6 million as of June 26, 2011, due to the addition of Novellus related activity and increased customer shipment levels in the second half of fiscal year 2012. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. The anticipated future revenue value from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23 million as of June 24, 2012 compared to $70 million as of June 26, 2011. Gross Margin Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross margin $ 1,084,069 $ 1,497,232 $ 969,935 $ (413,163 ) 27.6 % $ 527,297 54.4 % Percent of total revenue 40.7 % 46.2 % 45.5 % 5.5 % 0.7 % The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to decreased factory and field utilization as a result of lower volume, and less favorable customer and product mix. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased factory and field utilization as a result of higher volume. Research and Development Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except percentages) Research & development (R&D) $ 444,559 $ 373,293 $ 320,859 $ 71,266 19.1 % $ 52,434 16.3 % Percent of total revenue 16.7 % 11.5 % 15.0 % 5.2 % 3.5 % We continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading edge plasma etch, single wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to an $18 million increase in salary and benefits as a result of higher headcount, a $21 million increase in supplies, and an $11 million increase in depreciation related to new product development. Also included in our results are $11 million of Novellus related R&D expenses that were incurred in the June 2012 quarter from acquisition date through June 24, 2012. The increase in R&D spending during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to a $27 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability, and a $19 million increase in outside services and supplies related to new product development. Approximately 30% of both fiscal years 2012 and 2011 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years, which is reflective of our continued investment in new products and technologies. Selling, General and Administrative Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10 (in thousands, except percentages) Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) $ 400,052 $ 308,075 $ 240,942 $ 91,977 29.9 % $ 67,133 27.9 % Percent of total revenue 15.0 % 9.5 % 11.3 % 5.5 % 1.8 % The increase in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was due primarily to $63 million in expenses related to the Novellus acquisition and integration and $13 million of Novellus related SG&A expenses, including $4 million of intangible asset amortization, incurred in the June 2012 quarter from acquisition date through June 24, 2012. The growth in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to a $44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, mainly as a result of higher headcount and stronger company profitability, and an $18 million increase in outside services and supplies for customer penetration activities. Rent and depreciation related expenses increased in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 by approximately $13 million. The increases in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2011 were offset by the release of approximately $4 million of previously reserved allowance for doubtful accounts as the result of cash collections from customers. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During fiscal year 2012 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.9 million, consisting of a $1.7 million expense related to a decline in the market value of certain facilities partially offset by the release of $0.8 million related to a recorded obligation not realized for a previously restructured product line. During fiscal year 2011 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $11.6 million consisting 27 Table of Contents primarily of certain facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for previously restructured leases. During fiscal year 2010 we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $24.8 million, consisting primarily of $19.8 million of facilities charges related to the reassessment of future obligations for certain previously restructured leases and $6.0 million of asset impairment charges related to production efficiencies and shifts in product demands, partially offset by a recovery of $2.2 million related to inventory previously restructured in connection with our initial product line integration road maps. For further details related to restructuring and asset impairment, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 409A Expense In fiscal year 2008, following the voluntary independent review of our historical option grant process, we considered whether Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of state law would apply to stock options that were found to have intrinsic value at the time of their respective measurement dates. If a stock option is not considered as issued with an exercise price of at least the fair market value of the underlying stock, it may be subject to penalty taxes under Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. In such a case, taxes may be assessed not only on the intrinsic value increase, but on the entire stock option gain as measured at various times. On March 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to assume potential tax liabilities of certain employees, relating to options that might be subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law. Those liabilities totaled $50.9 million for fiscal year 2008 and an incremental $3.2 million of expense during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, we reached final settlement of matters associated with our 409A expenses with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) resulting in a credit of $44.4 million due to the reversal of 409A liabilities. There were no expenses or reversals related to Section 409A during fiscal year 2011 or 2012. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended June 24,2012 June 26,2011 June 27,2010 (in thousands) Interest income $ 12,141 $ 9,890 $ 8,682 Interest expense (38,962 ) (5,380 ) (994 ) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan related assets (914 ) 5,682 (84 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss) (397 ) (11,085 ) (103 ) Other, net (5,183 ) (2,516 ) (2,770 ) $ (33,315 ) $ (3,409 ) $ 4,731 The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increases in our average cash and investment balances from cash provided by operations and proceeds from convertible note financing, which was partially offset by treasury stock transactions and the decrease in interest rate yields. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2012 as compared with fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2011 as compared with fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of the $900 million convertible notes during May 2011. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2012 were related to un hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. Foreign exchange losses in fiscal year 2011 were related to un hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures, primarily in the Euro, Korean Won, and Singapore dollar. Other expenses during fiscal year 2012 increased as compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to increased charitable contributions. Income Tax Expense Our annual income tax expense was $35.7 million, $77.1 million, and $83.5 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was 17.5%, 9.6%, and 19.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the level of income, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, decrease in federal R&D tax credit due to the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2011, increase in non deductible stock based compensation, and non deductible acquisition costs. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the settlement of audits, and tax benefit due to the extension of the second half of fiscal year 2010 federal R&D tax credit. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $253.7 million and $160.6 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $285.6 million and $45.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $55.2 million and $46.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2012 and 2011 is primarily as a result of our acquisition of Novellus. 28 Table of Contents We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our fiscal years 2012 and 2011 valuation allowance of $55.2 million and $46.2 million relate to California and certain foreign deferred tax assets. At our fiscal year end of June 24, 2012 we continued to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the cost of performance sales factor sourcing rule and the single sales factor apportionment election. Additionally, we recorded valuation allowance related to tax assets established in purchase price accounting. We released valuation allowance on certain foreign entities deferred tax assets due to an increase in the forecasted income and indefinite net operating loss carryforward period in those jurisdictions. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. Uncertain Tax Positions We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance, completed our system installation obligations, or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. If terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. If the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis. Our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. The maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. We generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. We generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. We recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that generally approximate actual costs on a first in, first out basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. We reassess standard costs as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are generally based on the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, normalized assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and normalized overhead. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. We eliminate all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities from our Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of managements estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, managements forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. Warranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems. When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system by system basis. Actual warranty expenses are accounted for on a system by system basis and may differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred. Equity based Compensation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and Employee Stock Plans: GAAP requires us to recognize the fair value of equity based compensation in net income. We determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (RSUs) based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards using the Black Scholes option valuation model. This model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. We amortize the fair value of equity based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in paid in capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid in capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid in capital. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We allocate the carrying value of goodwill to our reporting units. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 30 Table of Contents We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. Beginning with our fiscal year 2012 goodwill impairment analysis, we adopted new accounting guidance that allowed us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. Under the revised guidance, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. In addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new authoritative guidance that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amendments in this standard require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance does not affect the underlying accounting for components of OCI, but will change the presentation of our financial statements. We will adopt this authoritative guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2013. In September 2011, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this guidance during fiscal year 2012 and it did not have a significant impact on the results of our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2012 compared to $2.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2011. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operations and cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of Novellus, which was offset by $773 million of share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $499 million during fiscal year 2012 consisted of (in millions): Net income $ 168.7 Non cash charges: Depreciation and amortization 100.8 Equity based compensation 81.6 Restructuring charges, net 0.9 Net tax benefit on equity based compensation plans (1.2 ) Deferred income taxes 42.4 Amortization of convertible note discount 27.0 Impairment of investment 1.7 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts 66.2 Other 10.9 $ 499.0 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: decreases in inventories of $74.0 million, accounts receivable of $66.1 million, and prepaid and other assets of $43.2 million and an increase in accounts payable of $12.1 million, partially offset by the following uses of cash: decreases in accrued liabilities of $120.0 million and deferred profit of $9.2 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $269.7 million which was primarily due to $418.7 million cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of Novellus, partially offset by capital expenditures of $107.3 million and net purchases of available for sale securities and other investment of $52.7 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $692.7 million which was primarily due to $772.7 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by $55.2 million net cash settlements under structured stock repurchase arrangement (see Note 20 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equity based plans of $27.3 million. Liquidity Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at June 24, 2012 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances in the United States and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP and include our long term debt which is outlined in the following table and noted below. Our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of June 24, 2012, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $274.2 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters, Livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $164.9 million. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital Leases Capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2012 under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and or cancellation penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid. Long Term Debt On May 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes, and collectively with the 2016 Notes, the Notes). The 2016 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at rate of 1.25% per annum. The Notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 15.8687 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of our common stock. The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. The separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the Notes. In June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the 2041 Notes). The 2041 Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 28.4781 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $35.11 per share of common stock. During fiscal year 2012, 2011, and 2010 we made $5.3 million, $4.5 million, and $21.0 million, respectively, in principal payments on long term debt and capital leases, respectively. Other Guarantees We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2012, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. Generally, we indemnify, under pre determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. We provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 24, 2012, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $19.9 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid. Warranties We offer standard warranties on our systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. 33 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 24, 2012, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities Our investments in various interest earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2012 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateDecrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as ofJune 24, 2012 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an Interest RateIncrease of X Basis Points (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 0.00% 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS (in thousands) Municipal Notes and Bonds $ 327,596 $ 325,920 $ 324,244 $ 322,567 $ 320,891 $ 319,215 $ 317,539 US Treasury & Agencies 140,968 139,794 138,620 137,446 136,272 135,098 133,924 Government Sponsored Enterprises 126,329 125,309 124,289 123,268 122,248 121,228 120,208 Foreign Government Bond 6,582 6,507 6,433 6,358 6,283 6,209 6,134 Corporate Notes and Bonds 781,039 776,993 772,947 768,901 764,856 760,811 756,765 Mortgage Backed Securities Residential 26,797 26,522 26,247 25,972 25,697 25,422 25,147 Mortgage Backed Securities Commercial 86,387 85,875 85,364 84,853 84,341 83,830 83,319 Total $ 1,495,698 $ 1,486,920 $ 1,478,144 $ 1,469,365 $ 1,460,588 $ 1,451,813 $ 1,443,036 We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification. Long Term Debt As of June 24, 2012, we had $1.6 billion in principal amount of fixed rate long term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $1.7 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and or our common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and or our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. Equity Price Risk Publicly Traded Securities The values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 24, 2012 were as follows: Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Decreasein Stock Price Fair Value as ofJune 24, 2012 Valuation of SecuritiesGiven an X% Increasein Stock Price (25%) (15%) (10%) 0.00% 10% 15% 25% (in thousands) Mutual Funds $ 13,316 $ 15,091 $ 15,979 $ 17,754 $ 19,529 $ 20,417 $ 22,193 Publicly traded equity securities $ 4,435 $ 5,026 $ 5,322 $ 5,913 $ 6,504 $ 6,800 $ 7,391 Total $ 17,751 $ 20,117 $ 21,301 $ 23,667 $ 26,033 $ 27,217 $ 29,584 34 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange (FX) Risk We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain revenues denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, certain spares and service contracts denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices denominated in the related countries local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen denominated revenue and monetary asset and liability exposure, Euro denominated expenses and monetary assets and liabilities, as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Swiss francs, Taiwanese dollars, and Great British pounds. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen denominated revenue and Euro denominated expenses, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen, Euros, Swiss franc, Taiwanese dollar, and Great British pound denominated monetary assets and liabilities against the U.S. dollar. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 24, 2012 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent.
