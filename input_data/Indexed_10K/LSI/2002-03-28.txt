Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words "intends," "believes," "expects", "anticipates," and similar expressions are intended to identify "forward looking statements" within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Companys ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Companys existing business and operations; the Companys ability to form joint ventures and sell exi sting properties to those joint ventures; the Companys ability to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Companys existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Companys outstanding floating rate debt; the Companys ability to successfully implement its Uncle Bobs Flex a Space strategy; the Companys cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; and tax law changes which may change the taxability of future income. Significant Accounting Policies And Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ fr om these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes its judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of its storage facilities is a significant accounting policy. The Companys policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the storage facility may not be recoverable. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect the Companys operating results and financial position. At Decembe r 31, 2001 and 2000, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy, and, accordingly, this policy had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 The Company recorded rental revenues of $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $0.9 million or 1% when compared to 2000 rental revenues of $88.2 million. Of this, $3.3 million resulted from a 4% increase in revenues at the 217 core properties considered in same store sales. $0.5 million resulted from the acquisition of 8 stores during 2001 and from having the 2000 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. These increases were offset by a $2.9 million decrease from the sale of 7 stores to a joint venture in 2000. Interest and other income increased to $2.3 million in 2001 from $2.1 million in 2000, due to increases in ancillary income from management fees, truck rental and cell towers. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $1.5 million or 5% during the period. Of this, $1.4 million resulted from increased expenses at the 217 core properties considered as same stores. $0.7 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2001 and from having the 2000 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. These increases were offset by a reduction of $0.6 million from the sale of 7 stores to a joint venture in 2000. General and administrative expenses increased $2.2 million in 2001. The increase was primarily a result of a $1.7 million expense in connection with a lawsuit settlement see discussion in "Legal Proceedings". In 2001, interest expense decreased to $13.9 million from $17.5 million as a result of significant decreases in interest rates. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $15.0 million from $14.3 million, primarily as a result of the additional depreciation taken on the real estate assets acquired in 2001 and a full year of depreciation on 2000 acquisitions. The Company recorded a $0.1 million loss in 2001 from its ownership interest in two real estate joint ventures. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, minority interest and extraordinary loss decreased 7.9% from $59.5 million in 2000 to $54.8 million in 2001 as a result of the aforementioned items. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 The Company recorded rental revenues of $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $5.8 million or 7% when compared to 1999 rental revenues of $82.4 million. Of this, $3.2 million resulted from the acquisition of 5 stores during 2000 and from having the 1999 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. The additional $2.6 million increase resulted from increased revenues at the 204 core properties considered in same store sales. For this core group, total revenues increased 3.7%, primarily as the result of rental rate increases. Interest and other income increased to $2.1 million in 2000 from $1.2 million in 1999, due to increases in ancillary income from management fees, truck rental and cell towers. A $2.2 million gain was recorded on the sale of 7 stores to a joint venture that is 45% owned by the Company. In 1999, the Company sold 1 store to an unaffiliated entity resulting in a $0.65 million gain. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $2.8 million or 11.4% during the period. Of this, $1 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2000 and from having the 1999 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. The remaining $1.8 million increase was incurred in the operation of the 204 core properties, including additional advertising of $1 million related to the Companys Flex a Space concept in 2000. General and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million in 2000. The increase was primarily a result of increased supervisory and accounting costs associated with the operation of an increased number of properties. In 2000, interest expense increased to $17.5 million from $13.9 million as a result of significant increases in interest rates. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $14.3 million from $13.1 million, primarily as a result of the additional depreciation taken on the real estate assets acquired in 2000 and a full year of depreciation on 1999 acquisitions. The Company recorded a $0.2 million loss in 2000 from its ownership interest in two real estate joint ventures. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, minority interest and extraordinary loss increased 9.4% from $54.4 million in 1999 to $59.5 million in 2000 as a result of the aforementioned items. A $0.2 million extraordinary loss was recorded in 2000 when the Companys credit facility and term note were replaced with a new agreement in November 2000. PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results of operations as though the acquisitions and sales of storage facilities in 2001 and 2000 had all occurred as of the beginning of 2000. Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2001 2000 Revenues: Rental income $92,175 $89,049 Interest and other income 2,515 1,880 Total revenues 94,690 90,929 Expenses: Property operations and maintenance 21,238 19,573 Real estate taxes 8,188 7,712 General and administrative 8,076 5,846 Interest 14,543 14,543 Depreciation and amortization 15,536 15,536 Equity in losses of joint ventures 102 177 Total expenses 67,683 63,387 Income before minority interest and extraordinary item 27,007 27,542 Minority interest (2,473) (2,611) Income before extraordinary item 24,534 24,931 Extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt (211) Net income $24,534 $24,720 Series B preferred stock dividend (2,955) (2,955) Net income available to common shareholders $21,579 $21,765 Total revenues of $94.7 million in 2001 increased by 4.1% over 2000s revenues of $90.9 million, primarily as a result of rate increases at the stores and increases in other income. Operating expenses and real estate taxes in 2001 were $29.4 million, as compared to $27.3 million in 2000, an increase of 7.7%. The increase was due to increased personnel and property tax costs. General and administrative costs were determined by the Companys historical costs incurred in the management of properties and increased due to a $1.7 million expense in connection with a lawsuit settlement in 2001. Interest expense in both years was determined by adjusting the 2001 expense for borrowings made for acquisitions. Such unaudited pro forma information is based upon the historical consolidated statements of operations of the Company. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and notes thereto. In managements opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of these transactions have been made. This unaudited pro forma statement does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations of the Company would have been assuming such transactions had been completed as set forth above, nor does it purport to represent the results of operations for future periods. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CAPITAL RESOURCES, UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT AND TERM NOTE The Companys unsecured credit facility provides availability up to $150 million, of which $134 million was drawn on December 31, 2001. The facility matures in November 2003 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.375%. In addition to the credit facility, the Company has two unsecured term notes; one in the amount of $30 million due November 2002 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.375% and the other in the amount of $75 million bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. The $75 million note has a maturity date of November 2003, but can be extended through November 2005 at the Companys option. The credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ), Moodys (Baa3), and Fitch (BBB ). In July 1999 the Company issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The net proceeds of $28.6 million were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the credit facility. The Series B Preferred Stock is currently rated by Standard and Poors (BB+), Moodys (Ba2) and Fitch (BB+). In 2001, the Company acquired 66,753 shares of its common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors in 1998. Through December 31, 2001 the Company has reacquired 839,453 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, the Company expects to continue reacquiring shares. The Company believes that its internally generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends, and share repurchases for the year 2002. The Company expects to fund its maturing $30 million term note with the availability on its unsecured credit facility and the proceeds received from the sale of 8 properties to Locke Sovran II, LLC (see "Disposition of Properties"). Future growth is expected to be funded through issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of Properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. The Companys outstanding debt as of December 31, 2001, assuming available extensions, matures as follows: 2002:$30 million 2003:$134 million 2005:$75 million ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2001 the Company used borrowings pursuant to the line of credit to acquire 3 Properties in Massachusetts and Maine comprising 0.2 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. An unaffiliated company also contributed 5 properties to a consolidated joint venture, Locke Sovran II, LLC, in exchange for an ownership interest in that joint venture. These Properties are located in Georgia, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. In 2000, 5 facilities totaling 0.2 million square feet were acquired. At December 31, 2001, the Company owned and or operated 241 self storage facilities in 21 states. Of these facilities, 11 are managed by the Company for Locke Sovran I, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2001, the Company sold 8 Properties for approximately $24.5 million to Locke Sovran II, LLC. Because Locke Sovran II, LLC is a consolidated joint venture, no gain was recognized on the sale. In 2000, the Company sold 7 Properties for approximately $20 million, recognizing a gain of $2.1 million. The gain recognized represents the proportion of the total gain not related to the Companys ongoing ownership interest. The Properties were sold to a joint venture in which the Company retained a 45% interest and whose properties the Company will manage for an ongoing fee. The Company invested $5 million of the proceeds to fund its 45% interest in the venture and received a short term promissory note of approximately $15 million. The note was repaid in 2001 and the Company used the proceeds to pay down its outstanding line of credit, freeing up working capital for acquisitions and expansions done in 2001. The Company may seek to sell additional Properties to similar joint venture programs in 2002. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES Investment in joint ventures includes an ownership interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC, which operates 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States, and an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses the Companys headquarters and other tenants. In December 2000, the Company contributed 7 self storage properties to Locke Sovran I, LLC with a fair market value of $19.8 million, in exchange for a $15 million 1 year note receivable bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% that was repaid in 2001, and a 45% interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Companys share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs income was $163,000, which is recorded as equity in losses of joint ventures on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also has a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2001. The majority of the $800,000 investment relates to interest bearing loans made by the Company to the joint venture. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Companys share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs loss was $305,000. The Company paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $225,000 and $164,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. A summary of the unconsolidated joint ventures financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001 is as follows: (dollars in thousands) Locke Sovran I, LLC Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in storage facilities, net $ 40,426 $ Investment in office building 6,341 Other assets 1,957 160 Total Assets $ 42,383 $ 6,501 Due to the Company $ 679 $ 800 Mortgage payable 30,500 6,440 Other liabilities 555 167 Total Liabilities 31,734 7,407 Unaffiliated partners equity (deficiency) 5,465 (482) Company equity (deficiency) 5,184 (424) Total Liabilities and Partners Equity (Deficiency) $ 42,383 $ 6,501 Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 5,511 $ 474 Total expenses 5,150 1,097 Net income (loss) $ 361 $ (623) The Company does not guarantee the debt of either joint venture. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS The Companys external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities it owns by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which it already has operations, or to expand in new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. At December 31, 2001, the Company had no contracts to acquire additional properties. The Companys consolidated joint venture, Locke Sovran II, LLC had 12 properties under contract at December 31, 2001. All of these properties were purchased by Locke Sovran II, LLC in February 2002 for $25.9 million. The Company also intends to expand and enhance certain of its existing facilities by building additional storage buildings on presently vacant land and by installing climate control and enhanced security systems at selected sites. REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, the Company is not required to pay federal income tax on income that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before the Company files its federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2002 may be applied toward the Companys 2001 distribution requirement. As a REIT, the Company must derive at least 95% of its total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2001, the Companys percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 97%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable the Company to maintain its REIT designation. INTEREST RATE RISK At December 31, 2001, the Company has three outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The first, entered in March 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 5.36% through November 2005 on $50 million notional amount. The second, entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.485% through October 2006 on another $50 million notional amount. The third, also entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.805% through September 2008 on $30 million notional amount. The Company has an unsecured credit facility in place through November 2003 enabling the Company to borrow funds at rates of LIBOR plus 1.375% and 1.75%. Accordingly, as a result of the above described interest rate swap agreements, the Company has fixed its interest rate through November 2003 on $50 million at 6.735%, on another $50 million at 5.86%, and on $30 million at 6.555%. Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, the Companys total interest may change dependent on the terms it negotiates with its lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $130 million of the Companys debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Because all but $130 million of the Companys outstanding debt of $241 million is on a floating rate basis, changes in short term interest rates could have a significant impact on the Companys earnings and funds from operations. Should the Company enter into further rate swap agreements, earnings could be negatively affected, as short term rates are presently significantly below the five and seven year cost of funds. Based upon the Companys indebtedness at December 31, 2001, and taking the interest rate swap agreements into account, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to interest expense of approximately $1.1 million. INFLATION The Company does not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on its operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities allow for monthly rent increases, which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease matures. SEASONALITY The Companys revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarter, primarily because the Company increases its rental rates on most of its storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, the Company believes that its tenant mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, the Company does not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, but retains its fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and those to be disposed of by sale. The Company must adopt this standard in 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Item 7A.
