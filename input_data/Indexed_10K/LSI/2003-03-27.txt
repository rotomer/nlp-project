Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words "intends," "believes," "expects", "anticipates," and similar expressions are intended to identify "forward looking statements" within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Companys ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Companys existing business and operations; the Companys ability to form joint ventures an d sell existing properties to those joint ventures and others; the Companys ability to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Companys existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Companys outstanding floating rate debt; the Companys ability to successfully implement its truck leasing program and Dri Guard product roll out; the Companys reliance on its call center; the Companys cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; and tax law changes which may change the taxability of future income. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ f rom these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes its judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of its storage facilities is a significant accounting policy. The Companys policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow or significant declining revenue per storage facility. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash 20 &lt;PAGE&gt; flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect the Companys operating results and financial position. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy, and, accordingly, this policy had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 The Company recorded rental revenues of $100.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $10.9 million or 12.2% when compared to 2001 rental revenues of $89.1 million. Of this increase, $1.2 million resulted from a 1.3% increase in revenues at the 222 core properties considered in same store sales. The remaining $9.7 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of 23 stores during 2002 and from having the 2001 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.2 million due to increased insurance sales and the additional revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.1 million or 17.7% in 2002 compared to 2001. Of this, $3.5 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2002 and from having the 2001 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. The remaining $1.6 million increase was due to increased insurance, personnel, truck expense, and increased property taxes at the 222 core properties considered same stores. General and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million or 7.0%. The increase includes additional costs of approximately $2.3 million, which primarily resulted from increased cost in the Companys call center and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2002. The 2001 general and administrative expenses included a $1.7 million expense in connection with the lawsuit settlement see Note 15 of the financial statements. There was no such charge in 2002. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $17.4 million from $15.0 million, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on 2001 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $39.5 million in 2001 to $42.6 million in 2002 as a result of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $13.9 million to $14.7 million as a result of higher rates associated with the mortgage debt incurred on the consolidated joint venture properties and the effect of interest rate swap agreements entered into during 2001. 21 &lt;PAGE&gt; YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 The Company recorded rental revenues of $89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $0.9 million or 1% when compared to 2000 rental revenues of $88.2 million. Of this, $3.3 million resulted from a 4% increase in revenues at the 217 core properties considered in same store sales. $0.5 million resulted from the acquisition of eight stores during 2001 and from having the 2000 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. These increases were offset by a $2.9 million decrease from the sale of seven stores to a joint venture in 2000. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $1.5 million or 5% in 2001 compared to 2000. Of this increase, $1.4 million resulted from increased expenses at the 217 core properties considered as same stores. $0.7 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2001 and from having the 2000 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. These increases were offset by a reduction of $0.6 million from the sale of seven stores to a joint venture in 2000. General and administrative expenses increased $2.2 million or 38.7% in 2001 compared to 2000. The increase was primarily a result of a $1.7 million expense in connection with a lawsuit settlement see Note 15 of the financial statements. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $15.0 million from $14.3 million, primarily as a result of the additional depreciation taken on the real estate assets acquired in 2001 and a full year of depreciation on 2000 acquisitions. Income from operations decreased 8.3% from $43.0 million in 2000 to $39.5 million in 2001 as a result of the aforementioned items. In 2001, interest expense decreased to $13.9 million from $17.5 million as a result of significant decreases in interest rates. The Company recorded a $0.1 million loss in 2001 from its ownership interest in two real estate joint ventures. RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Net income $ 26,301 $ 24,189 $ 25,707 $ 25,585 $ 23,540 Minority interest in income 1,990 1,617 1,812 1,762 1,258 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 16,497 14,122 13,446 12,359 10,110 Gain on sale of real estate (2,161) (652) Share of office building joint venture loss 42 305 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 358 328 202 22 &lt;PAGE&gt; Preferred stock dividends (4,863) (2,955) (2,955) (1,239) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Operating Partnership (1,647) (2,333) (2,388) (2,516) (1,830) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Locke Sovran II (1,645) (125) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $ 37,033 $ 35,148 $ 33,663 $ 35,299 $ 33,078 The Company believes that Funds from Operations ("FFO") provides relevant and meaningful information about its operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of its operating results. Funds from operations is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. CAPITAL RESOURCES, UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT AND TERM NOTE The Companys unsecured credit facility provides availability up to $150 million, of which $128 million was drawn on December 31, 2002. The facility matures in November 2003 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.375%. In addition to the credit facility, the Company has a $75 million unsecured term note bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. The $75 million note has a maturity date of November 2003, but can be extended through November 2005 at the Companys option. The credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ), Moodys (Baa3), and Fitch (BBB ). In February 2002, the consolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran II, LLC) entered into a mortgage note of $48 million. The note is secured by the 27 properties owned by the joint venture with a cost of $79 million. The 10 year note bears interest at 7.19%. Principal maturities of the mortgage for the next five years are as follows: 2003, $0.7 million; 2004, $0.7 million; 2005, $0.8 million; 2006, $0.9 million; and 2007, $0.9 million. 23 &lt;PAGE&gt; During 2002, the Company entered into lease agreements, qualifying as capital leases, for trucks to be used at its storage facilities. Principal maturities for capital lease obligations are as follows: 2003, $0.5 million; 2004, $0.5 million; 2005, $0.6 million; and 2006, $0.3 million. In July 1999, the Company issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is currently rated by Standard and Poors (BB+), Moodys (Ba2) and Fitch (BB+). On July 3, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement providing for the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 379,166 shares of common stock at $32.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. The Company immediately issued 1,600,000 shares of the Series C Preferred and issued the remaining 1,200,000 shares on November 27, 2002. The offering price was $25.00 per share and the net proceeds of $67.9 million were used to reduce indebtedness that was incurred in the June acquisition of seven self storage properties and to repay a portion of the line of credit. In 2002, the Company acquired 186,617 shares of its common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2002, the Company has reacquired 1,026,070 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, the Company expects to continue reacquiring shares. The Company believes that its internally generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends, and share repurchases for the year 2003. The Company expects to replace its maturing unsecured credit facility with a new unsecured credit facility and medium to long term unsecured term notes. Future growth is expected to be funded through issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of Properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. The Companys outstanding unsecured debt as of December 31, 2002, assuming available extensions, matures as follows: 2003, $128 million; and 2005, $75 million. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2002, the Company and the consolidated joint venture used borrowings pursuant to the line of credit and a mortgage to acquire 23 Properties in Texas and New York comprising 1.5 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. In 2001, three facilities totaling 200,000 square feet were acquired. At December 31, 2002, the Company owned and or operated 264 self storage facilities in 21 states. Of these facilities, 11 are managed by the Company for Locke Sovran I, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS The Companys external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities it owns by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which it already has operations, or to expand in new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. 24 &lt;PAGE&gt; At December 31, 2002, the Company had no contracts to acquire additional properties. The Company also intends to expand and enhance certain of its existing facilities by building additional storage buildings on presently vacant land and by installing climate control and enhanced security systems at selected sites. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2001, the Company sold eight Properties for approximately $24.5 million to Locke Sovran II, LLC. Because Locke Sovran II, LLC is a consolidated joint venture, no gain was recognized on the sale. In 2000, the Company sold seven Properties for approximately $20 million, recognizing a gain of $2.1 million. The gain recognized represents the proportion of the total gain not related to the Companys ongoing ownership interest. The Properties were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company retained a 45% interest and whose properties the Company will manage for an ongoing fee. The Company invested $5 million of the proceeds to fund its 45% interest in the venture and received a short term promissory note of approximately $15 million. The note was repaid in 2001 and the Company used the proceeds to pay down its outstanding line of credit, freeing up working capital for acquisitions and expansions done in 2001. The Company may seek to sell additional Properties to similar joint venture programs or third parties in 2003. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES Investment in joint ventures includes an ownership interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC, which operates 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States, and an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses the Companys headquarters and other tenants. In December 2000, the Company contributed seven self storage properties to Locke Sovran I, LLC with a fair market value of $19.8 million, in exchange for a $15 million one year note receivable bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% that was repaid in 2001, and a 45% interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs loss was $12,500, which is recorded as equity in losses of joint ventures on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also has a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2002. The majority of the $1.6 million investment relates to interest bearing loans made by the Company to the joint venture. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs loss was $42,000. The Company paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $225,000 in 2002 and 2001. 25 &lt;PAGE&gt; A summary of the unconsolidated joint ventures financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 is as follows: (dollars in thousands) Locke Sovran I, LLC Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in storage facilities, net $ 40,099 $ Investment in office building 6,903 Other assets 1,952 471 Total Assets $ 42,051 $ 7,374 Due to the Company $ 2,023 $ 1,574 Demand note payable 900 Mortgage payable 30,269 5,800 Other liabilities 706 137 Total Liabilities 32,998 8,411 Unaffiliated partners equity (deficiency) 4,913 (529) Company equity (deficiency) 4,140 (508) Total Liabilities and Partners Equity (Deficiency) $ 42,051 $ 7,374 Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 5,807 $ 815 Total expenses 5,835 901 Net loss $ (28) $ (86) The Company does not guarantee the debt of Locke Sovran I, LLC; it does guarantee the $900,000 demand note payable of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, the Company is not required to pay federal income tax on income that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of its taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before the Company files its federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2003 may be applied toward the Companys 2002 distribution requirement. As a REIT, the Company must derive at least 95% of its total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2002, the Companys percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 97%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable the Company to maintain its REIT designation. INTEREST RATE RISK At December 31, 2002, the Company has three outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The first, entered into in March 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 5.36% through November 2005 on $50 million notional amount. The second, entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.485% through October 2006 on another $50 million notional amount. The third, also entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base 26 &lt;PAGE&gt; rate at 4.805% through September 2008 on $30 million notional amount. The Company has an unsecured credit facility in place through November 2003 enabling the Company to borrow funds at rates of LIBOR plus 1.375% and 1.75%. Accordingly, as a result of the above described interest rate swap agreements, the Company has fixed its interest rate through November 2003 on $50 million at 6.735%, on another $50 million at 5.86%, and on $30 million at 6.555%. Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, the Companys total interest may change dependent on the terms it negotiates with its lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $130 million of the Companys debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Because all but $130 million of the Companys outstanding unsecured debt of $203 million is on a floating rate basis, changes in short term interest rates could have a significant impact on the Companys earnings and funds from operations. Should the Company enter into further rate swap agreements, earnings could be negatively affected, as short term rates are presently significantly below the five and seven year cost of funds. Based upon the Companys indebtedness at December 31, 2002, and taking the interest rate swap agreements into account, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to interest expense of approximately $0.7 million. INFLATION The Company does not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on its operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities allow for monthly rent increases, which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease matures. SEASONALITY The Companys revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because the Company increases its rental rates on most of its storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, the Company believes that its tenant mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, the Company does not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of," but retains its fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and those to be disposed of by sale. SFAS 144 also extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity. The Company adopted this standard in 2002. The 27 &lt;PAGE&gt; adoption of this standard had no material effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition in 2002. Item 7A.
