Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words "intends," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," and similar expressions are intended to identify "forward looking statements" within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of the Securities Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Companys ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Companys existing business and operations; the Companys ability to form joint ventures and sell existing properties to those joint ventures and others; the Companys ability to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Companys existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Companys outstanding floating rate debt; the Companys ability to successfully extend its truck leasing program and Dri Guard product roll out; the Companys reliance on its call center; the Companys cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow or significant declining revenue per storage facility. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the 21 &lt;page&gt; undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy, and, accordingly, this policy had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), but no assurance can be given that it will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 We recorded rental revenues of $110.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $10.2 million or 10.2% when compared to 2002 rental revenues of $100.0 million. Of this increase, $4.8 million resulted from a 5% increase in rental revenues at the 230 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2002). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units, and improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the availability of rental trucks at 158 of our stores. Occupancy levels grew slightly, and while the extensive discounting and promotional advertising seen in 2002 diminished, the storage industry as a whole was affected by a sluggish economy and a steady increase in supply of new storage units. The remaining $5.4 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of two stores during 2003 and from having the 2002 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.8 million due to increased insurance sales and the additional revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.6 million or 16.7% in 2003 compared to 2002. Of this, $1.7 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2003 and from having the 2002 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. The remaining $3.9 million increase was due to increased insurance, personnel, truck expense, maintenance, and increased property taxes at the 230 core properties considered same stores. While the trend of the past three years has been one of increasing operating costs, we expect this to subside in 2004 and 2005, as many of the new initiatives (increased store hours, truck availability and enhanced security and communication technologies) are now in place and related costs should not increase significantly. Nonetheless, the expenses related to operating a self storage facility have increased substantially since 2001, and while current operating margins are expected to be sustained, it is not li kely that much improvement will be seen in the coming years as a result of cost reductions. 22 &lt;page&gt; General and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million or 12.0%. The increase primarily resulted from increased cost in our call center, new training center, and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2003 and 2002. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $19.0 million from $17.4 million, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2003 and a full year of depreciation on 2002 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $42.6 million in 2002 to $45.4 million in 2003 as a result of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $14.7 million to $15.1 million as a result of higher interest rates associated with the fixed rate debt entered into in September 2003. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Rental revenues were $100.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $10.9 million or 12.2% when compared to 2001 rental revenues of $89.1 million. Of this increase, $1.2 million resulted from a 1.3% increase in revenues at the 222 core properties considered in same store sales. The remaining $9.7 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of 23 stores during 2002 and from having the 2001 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.2 million due to increased insurance sales and the additional revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.1 million or 17.7% in 2002 compared to 2001. Of this, $3.5 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2002 and from having the 2001 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. The remaining $1.6 million increase was due to increased insurance, personnel, truck expense, and increased property taxes at the 222 core properties considered same stores. General and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million or 7.0%. The increase includes additional costs of approximately $2.3 million, which primarily resulted from increased cost in our call center and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2002. The 2001 general and administrative expenses included a $1.7 million expense in connection with the lawsuit settlement see Note 15 of the financial statements. There was no such charge in 2002. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $17.4 million from $15.0 million, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on 2001 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $39.5 million in 2001 to $42.6 million in 2002 as a result of the aforementioned items. 23 &lt;page&gt; Interest expense increased from $13.9 million to $14.7 million as a result of higher rates associated with the mortgage debt incurred on the consolidated joint venture properties and the effect of interest rate swap agreements entered into during 2001. 24 &lt;page&gt; RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 Net income $28,423 $ 26,301 $ 24,189 $ 25,707 $ 25,585 Minority interest in income 1,790 1,990 1,617 1,812 1,762 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 18,149 16,497 14,122 13,446 12,359 Gain on sale of real estate (2,161) (652) Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 460 400 633 202 Write off of unamortized financing fees 713 Preferred stock dividends (8,818) (4,863) (2,955) (2,955) (1,239) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Operating Partnership (1,563) (1,647) (2,333) (2,388) (2,516) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Locke Sovran II (1,539) (1,645) (125) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $37,615 $ 37,033 $ 35,148 $ 33,663 $ 35,299 We believe that Funds from Operations ("FFO") provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. Funds from operations is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through September 2006, at which time our revolving line of credit matures. 25 &lt;page&gt; Cash flows from operating activities were $52.1 million, $45.6 million and $40.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The increase for each year is primarily attributable to increased net income and increased non cash charges for depreciation and amortization. On September 4, 2003, we entered into agreements relating to new unsecured credit arrangements, and received funds under those arrangements. Our new unsecured line of credit provides availability up to $75 million (expandable to $100 million), of which $9 million was drawn on December 31, 2003. The revolving line of credit facility matures in September 2006 and bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375%. We also entered into a $100 million term note through September 2008 at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. In addition to the line of credit and term note mentioned above, we also issued a $80 million unsecured term note bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26% and a $20 million unsecured term note bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. The term notes mature September 2013. The line of credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ), Moodys (Baa3), and Fitch (BBB ). In February 2002, the consolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran II, LLC) entered into a mortgage note of $48 million. The note is secured by the 27 properties owned by the joint venture with a cost of $79 million. The 10 year note bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.19%. Principal maturities of the mortgage for the next five years are as follows: 2004, $0.7 million; 2005, $0.8 million; 2006, $0.9 million; 2007, $0.9 million; and 2008, $1.0 million. In July 1999, we issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is currently rated by Standard and Poors (BB+), Moodys (Ba2) and Fitch (BB+). We have the ability to retire our Series B Preferred Stock issue at any time after July 31, 2004. Should market conditions be favorable, and if by so doing our capital position would be enhanced, it is expected that this issue would be redeemed at a total cost of $30 million. If we elect to redeem this stock, we would use the proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan to fund the redemption. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D 42, "The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock", we would expect to record a reduction of approximately $1.4 million from net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders relating to the difference between the Series B Preferre d Stock carrying value and the expected redemption amount should the issue be redeemed. On July 3, 2002, we entered into an agreement providing for the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 379,166 shares of common stock at $32.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. We immediately issued 1,600,000 shares of the Series C Preferred and issued the remaining 1,200,000 shares on November 27, 2002. The offering price was $25.00 per share and the net proceeds of $67.9 million were used to reduce indebtedness that was incurred in the June 2002 acquisition of seven self storage properties and to repay a portion of the line of credit. 26 &lt;page&gt; From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we acquired 145,816 shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2003, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. During 2003, we issued approximately 1,421,000 shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plan. We realized $42 million from the sale of such shares. We expect to issue shares when our share price and capital needs warrant such issuance. Future acquisitions, share repurchases and repayment of the credit line are expected to be funded with the revolving line of credit, issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Line of credit $9.0 million $9.0 million Term notes $200.0 million $100.0 million $100.0 million Building lease $2.8 million $0.4 million $0.8 million $0.8 million $0.8 million Total $211.8 million $0.4 million $9.8 million $100.8 million $100.8 million The above amounts for the line of credit and term notes exclude interest. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2003, we used operating cash flow and borrowings pursuant to the line of credit to acquire two Properties in Texas comprising 148,098 square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. In 2002, we along with the consolidated joint venture used borrowings pursuant to the line of credit and a mortgage to acquire 23 Properties comprising 1.5 million square feet. At December 31, 2003, we owned and or operated 266 self storage facilities in 21 states. Of these facilities, 11 are managed by us for Locke Sovran I, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand in new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. At December 31, 2003, we had no contracts to acquire additional properties. 27 &lt;page&gt; We also intend to expand and enhance certain of our existing facilities by building additional storage buildings on presently vacant land and by installing climate control and enhanced security systems at selected sites. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2001, we sold eight Properties for approximately $24.5 million to Locke Sovran II, LLC. Because Locke Sovran II, LLC is a consolidated joint venture, no gain was recognized on the sale. In 2000, we sold seven Properties for approximately $20 million, recognizing a gain of $2.1 million. The gain recognized represents the proportion of the total gain not related to our ongoing ownership interest. The Properties were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture in which we retained a 45% interest and whose properties we manage for an ongoing fee. We invested $5 million of the proceeds to fund our 45% interest in the venture and received a short term promissory note of approximately $15 million. The note was repaid in 2001 and we used the proceeds to pay down our outstanding line of credit, freeing up working capital for acquisitions and expansions done in 2001. We may seek to sell additional Properties to similar joint venture programs or third parties in 2004. On February 20, 2004, we sold our facility in Allentown, PA to an independent operator resulting in a gain of approximately $0.9 million and, at March 1, 2004, have negotiated agreements to sell two of our properties in Ohio to another independent operator. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES Investment in joint ventures includes an ownership interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC, which operates 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States, and an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses our headquarters and other tenants. In December 2000, we contributed seven self storage properties to Locke Sovran I, LLC with a fair market value of $19.8 million, in exchange for a $15 million one year note receivable bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% that was repaid in 2001, and a 45% interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs income was $86,000, which is recorded as equity in income of joint ventures on the consolidated statements of income. We manage the storage facilities for Locke Sovran I, LLC and received fees of $311,000, $290,000, and $413,000, for the years ended 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. We also have a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2003. The majority of the $1.0 million investment relates to interest bearing loans made by us to the joint venture. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs income was $59,000. We paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $393,000 in 2003 and $225,000 in 2002 and 2001. Also, during 2003 the Company purchased a tract of land from Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for $1.2 million. A summary of the unconsolidated joint ventures financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 is as follows: 28 &lt;page&gt; (dollars in thousands) Locke Sovran I, LLC Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in storage facilities, net $ 39,333 $ Investment in office building 6,051 Other assets 1,691 392 Total Assets $ 41,024 $ 6,443 Due to the Company $ 2,133 $ 1,418 Mortgage payable 30,018 5,800 Other liabilities 692 90 Total Liabilities 32,843 7,308 Unaffiliated partners equity (deficiency) 4,445 (458) Company equity (deficiency) 3,736 (407) Total Liabilities and Partners Equity (deficiency) $ 41,024 $ 6,443 Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 6,224 $ 994 Total expenses 6,032 873 Net income $ 192 $ 121 We do not expect to have material future cash outlays relating to these joint ventures and we do not guarantee the debt of Locke Sovran I, LLC or Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2004 may be applied toward our 2003 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2003, our percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 97%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. 29 &lt;page&gt; INTEREST RATE RISK At December 31, 2003, we have three outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The first, entered into in March 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 5.36% through November 2005 on $50 million notional amount. The second, entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.485% through October 2006 on another $50 million notional amount. The third, also entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.805% through September 2008 on $30 million notional amount. We have an unsecured credit facility in place through September 2006 enabling us to borrow funds at rates of LIBOR plus 1.375%, an unsecured term note at rates of LIBOR plus 1.5% through September 2008, and an unsecured term note at rates of LIBOR plus 1.5% through September 2013. As a result of the above described interest rate swap agreements, we have fixed our interest rate through November 2005 on $9 million at 6.735%, and $41 millio n at 6.86%, through October 2006 on $50 million at 5.985%, and through September 2008 on $29 million at 6.305%. Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $129 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through November 2005, all of our $209 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding debt of $209 million at December 31, 2003, a 1% increase in interest rates would have no effect on our interest expense. INFLATION We do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on our operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because we increase rental rates on most of our storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our tenant mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51." The primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights ("variable interest entities") and how to determine when and which business enterprise (the "primary beneficiary") should consolidate the variable interest entity. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either (i) 30 &lt;page&gt; the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest; or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires that the primary beneficiary, as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity, make additional disclosures. Certain disclosure requirements of FIN 46 were effective for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46 R") to address certain FIN 46 implementation issues. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 46 R applicable to Non Special Purpose Entities created prior to February 1, 2003, but do not expect a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Effective June 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (Statement No. 150). Statement No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability. Many of these instruments were previously classified as equity. Statement No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 150 3, "Effective Date for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under SFAS 150", w hich defers certain provisions of Statement No. 150 as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The deferral is expected to remain in effect while those issues are addressed in either Phase II of the FASBs Liabilities and Equity project or Phase II of the Business Combination project. Adoption of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A.
