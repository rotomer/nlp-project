Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words "intends," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," and similar expressions are intended to identify "forward looking statements" within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of the Securities Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; our ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into our existing business and operations; our ability to effectively compete in the industry in which we do business; our e xisting indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with our outstanding floating rate debt; our ability to successfully extend our truck move in program for new customers and Dri guard product roll out; our reliance on our call center; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We are the fifth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned or managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly trade name "Uncle Bobs Self Storage." Operating Strategy: Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: Operating performance continues to improve as a result of revenue drivers implemented by us over the past three years, including: The formation of our Customer Care Center, which answers sales inquiries and makes reservations for all of our properties on a centralized basis, The rollout of the Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 207 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers in moving into their spaces, and An increase in internet marketing and sales. In addition to increasing revenue, we have worked to improve services and amenities at our stores. While this has caused operating expenses to increase over the past three years, it has resulted in a superior storage experience for our customers. Our managers are better qualified and receive a significantly higher level of training than they did three years ago, customer access and security are greatly enhanced as a result of advances in technology, and property appearance and functionality has been improved. Our customized property management systems enable us to improve our ability to track trends, set optimal pricing levels, enjoy considerable economies of scale in vendor and supply pricing, and control collections and accounts receivable. 17 &lt;page&gt; B. Acquiring additional stores: In markets where we already operate facilities, we seek to acquire new stores one or two at a time from independent operators. By so doing, we can add to our existing base, which should improve market penetration in those areas, and contribute to the benefits achieved from economies of scale. We will seek to enter new markets if we can do so by acquiring a group of stores in those markets. We feel that our marketing efforts and control systems would enhance even those portfolios that have been managed efficiently by independent operators, and that attractive returns can be generated by such acquisitions. C. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: We intend to continue to install climate controlled and Dri guard space at select stores, providing our customers with better storage solutions and improving yields on our portfolio. We intend to add buildings to a number of our stores, providing additional rental units of a size and type to meet existing demand. We will seek to acquire parcels of land contiguous to some of our stores and add to the available rental space at those stores. We intend to modify existing buildings to better match size and type of rental units to existing demand. At some stores, this may be as simple as reconfiguring walls and doors; at others, it may entail rebuilding in a configuration more in tune with market conditions. Over the next three years, we expect that the total of the expansions and enhancements discussed above will add 450,000 to 600,000 square feet of rentable space at existing stores and convert up to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to premium (climate and humidity controlled) space. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at between $32 and $40 million. Funding is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings on the Companys line of credit, and issuance of common shares in our Dividend Reinvestment Program and Stock Purchase Plan. Supply and Demand We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. However, the historically low interest rates available to developers over the past three years have resulted in increased supply on a national basis. We have experienced some of this excess supply in certain markets in Texas and New England, but because of the demand model, we have not seen a widespread effect on our stores. We have also observed an increase in the sales price of existing facilities as a result of the low interest rates, such that the capitalization rates on acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) have decreased from approximately 10% four years ago to 8.5% today. In 2004, we took advantage of these favorable capitalization rates by selling five stores for a gain of $1.1 million. With interest rates now on the rise we exp ect the trend of decreasing capitalization rates to reverse in the coming years and are forecasting acquisitions of $50 million in 2005 and no sales of existing stores. 18 &lt;page&gt; Operating Trends In 2004, the overall economy and our industry slowly gained momentum from the recovery that commenced in 2003. We experienced same store revenue growth of approximately 5% in each of 2004 and 2003. We attribute the same store growth to implementation of the call center, the free truck program for new move in customers, use of improved technology and practices in the management of our rental rates and, to a lesser degree, general economic factors. We expect conditions in most of our markets to remain stable and are forecasting 4% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2005. Expenses related to operating a self storage facility have increased substantially over the last five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). We expect the trend of increasing costs to continue at a moderate pace and, while current operating margins are expected to be sustained, it is unlikely that much improvement in operating margins will be seen in the coming years as a result of cost reductions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions o r conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow or significant declining revenue per storage facility. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values ar e not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. 19 &lt;page&gt; YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 We recorded rental revenues of $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $11.1 million or 10.2% when compared to 2003 rental revenues of $108.5 million. Of this increase, $5.3 million resulted from a 5% increase in rental revenues at the 244 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2003). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units, and a slight occupancy increase, which we believe resulted from improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the availability of rental trucks at 207 of our stores. The remaining $5.8 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of ten stores during 2004 and from having the 2003 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.8 mil lion due to increased insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $4.7 million or 12.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Of this increase, $2.1 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2004 and from having the 2003 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $1.9 million of the increase was due to increased insurance, personnel, truck, and maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 244 core properties considered same stores. We also incurred approximately $0.7 million of uninsured losses relating to the four hurricanes that hit the Eastern United States in 2004. We expect the trend of increasing operating costs to continue at a moderate pace although we do not expect the uninsured hurricane losses to occur annually. General and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million or 15.1% from 2003 to 2004. The increase primarily resulted from increased costs in our call center, professional fees related to the documentation, analysis, and testing of internal controls required by Sarbanes Oxley Section 404, and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2004 and 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $19.9 million in 2004 from $18.7 million in 2003, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2004 and a full year of depreciation on 2003 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $44.6 million in 2003 to $49.1 million in 2004 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $15.1 million in 2003 to $17.4 million in 2004 as a result of higher interest rates associated with the fixed rate debt entered into in September 2003 and additional borrowings under our line of credit to purchase ten stores in 2004. During 2004, the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $11.7 million, resulting in a gain of $1.1 million. The operations of these five facilities and the gain on sale in 2004 are reported as discontinued operations. On August 2, 2004, the Company redeemed all 1,200,000 outstanding shares of its 9.85% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for $30 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares. The excess of the redemption amount over the carrying value of the Series B Preferred Stock was $1.4 million and has been shown as a reduction in net income available to common shareholders. 20 &lt;page&gt; YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 We recorded rental revenues of $108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $10.1 million or 10.3% when compared to 2002 rental revenues of $98.3 million. Of this increase, $4.7 million resulted from a 5% increase in rental revenues at the 225 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2002). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units, and slightly increased occupancy levels, which we believe resulted from our improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the availability of rental trucks at 158 of our stores. Although the extensive discounting and promotional advertising seen in 2002 diminished in 2003, the storage industry as a whole was affected by a sluggish economy and a steady increase in supply of new storage units. The remaining $5.4 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of two stores during 2003 and from having the 2002 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.8 million due to increased insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.5 million or 16.8% in 2003 compared to 2002. Of this, $1.7 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2003 and from having the 2002 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. The remaining $3.8 million increase was due to increased insurance, personnel, truck expense, maintenance, and increased property taxes at the 225 core properties considered same stores. General and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million or 12.0% from 2002 to 2003. The increase primarily resulted from increased costs in our call center, new training center, and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2003 and 2002. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $18.7 million in 2003 from $17.1 million in 2002, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2003 and a full year of depreciation on 2002 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $41.8 million in 2002 to $44.6 million in 2003 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $14.7 million in 2002 to $15.1 million in 2003 as a result of higher interest rates associated with the fixed rate debt entered into in September 2003. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations ("FFO") provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. 21 &lt;page&gt; Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Net income $32,004 $28,423 $ 26,301 $ 24,189 $ 25,707 Minority interest in income 1,542 1,790 1,990 1,617 1,812 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 19,175 17,856 16,207 13,839 13,180 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 90 293 290 283 266 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 473 460 400 633 202 Gain on sale of real estate (1,137) (2,161) Preferred stock dividends (7,168) (8,818) (4,863) (2,955) (2,955) Redemption amount in excess of carrying value of Series B Preferred Stock (1,415) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Operating Partnership (1,333) (1,563) (1,647) (2,333) (2,388) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Locke Sovran II (1,475) (1,539) (1,645) (125) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $40,756 $36,902 $ 37,033 $ 35,148 $ 33,663 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through September 2007, at which time our revolving line of credit matures unless renewed at our option for one additional year. Cash flows from operating activities were $53.9 million, $50.9 million and $44.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The increase for each year is primarily attributable to increased net income and increased non cash charges for depreciation and amortization. On September 4, 2003, we entered into agreements relating to new unsecured credit arrangements, and received funds under those arrangements. In December 2004, the agreements were amended by increasing the line of credit availability from $75 million to $100 million (expandable to $200 million), reducing the interest rate from 22 &lt;page&gt; LIBOR plus 1.375% to LIBOR plus 0.90%, increasing the maturity by one year to September 2007, and retaining a one year extension option. In addition, the line of credit requires a facility fee of 0.20%. At December 31, 2004, there was $57 million available on our line of credit. The amendment also reduced the interest rate on the $100 million term note from LIBOR plus 1.50% to LIBOR plus 1.20%, and extended the maturity by one year to September 2009. In addition to the line of credit and term note mentioned above, in 2003 we also issued a $80 million unsecured term note bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26% and a $20 million unsecured term note bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. The term notes mature September 2013. The line of credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ) and Fitch (BBB ). Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all covenants. In February 2002, the consolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran II, LLC) entered into a mortgage note of $48 million. The note is secured by the 27 properties owned by the joint venture with a carrying value of $73.9 million and $74.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 10 year note bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.19%. In July 1999, we issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. We redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock on August 2, 2004 at a total cost of $30 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D 42, "The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock", we recorded a reduction of $1.4 million from 2004 net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders relating to the difference between the Series B Preferred Stock carrying value and the redemption amount. On July 3, 2002, we entered into an agreement providing for the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 379,166 shares of common stock at $32.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. We immediately issued 1,600,000 shares of the Series C Preferred and issued the remaining 1,200,000 shares on November 27, 2002. The offering price was $25.00 per share and the net proceeds of $67.9 million were used to reduce indebtedness that was incurred in the June 2002 acquisition of seven self storage properties and to repay a portion of our borrowings under the line of credit. On August 4, 2004, we issued 306,748 shares of our common stock in connection with a written notice from one of the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock requesting the conversion of 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. As a result of this conversion, all such 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock were retired leaving 2,400,000 shares outstanding at December 31, 2004. 23 &lt;page&gt; During 2004, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we acquired 145,816 shares of our common stock via this plan. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2004, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. During 2004, we issued approximately 1,389,000 shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plan. We realized $49 million from the sale of such shares. We expect to issue shares when our share price and capital needs warrant such issuance. Future acquisitions, share repurchases and repayment of the credit line are expected to be funded with the revolving line of credit, issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 and thereafter Line of credit $ 43.0 million $43.0 million Term notes $200.0 million $100.0 million $100.0 million Mortgage payable $ 46.1 million $0.8 million $ 1.8 million $ 2.1 million $ 41.4 million Building lease $ 2.0 million $0.4 million $ 0.8 million $ 0.8 million Total $291.1 million $1.2 million $45.6 million $102.9 million $141.4 million The above amounts for the line of credit, term notes and mortgage exclude interest. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2004, we used operating cash flow and borrowings pursuant to the line of credit to acquire ten Properties in Connecticut, Florida, Tennessee, and Texas comprising one million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2003, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire two Properties in Texas comprising 148,098 square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. In 2002, we, along with the consolidated joint venture, used borrowings pursuant to the line of credit and a mortgage to acquire 23 Properties comprising 1.5 million square feet. At December 31, 2004, we owned and or operated 271 self storage facilities in 21 states. Of these facilities, 11 are managed by us for Locke Sovran I, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand in new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. At December 31, 2004, we were in negotiations to acquire five stores for approximately $20 million. One of these stores was purchased on February 23, 2005 for $7.5 million. In addition, we plan, over the next three years, to implement a program that will add 450,000 to 600,000 square feet of rentable space at existing stores and convert up to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to premium (climate and humidity controlled) space. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at between $32 and $40 million. Funding of these and the above mentioned improvements is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings under our line of credit, and issuance of common shares through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. 24 &lt;page&gt; DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2004, as part of an asset management program, we sold five non strategic storage facilities located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio, and South Carolina to unaffiliated parties for $11.7 million resulting in a net gain of $1.1 million. During 2001, we sold eight Properties for approximately $24.5 million to Locke Sovran II, LLC. Because Locke Sovran II, LLC is a consolidated joint venture, no gain was recognized on the sale. In 2000, we sold seven Properties for approximately $20 million, recognizing a gain of $2.1 million. The gain recognized represents the proportion of the total gain not related to our ongoing ownership interest. The Properties were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture in which we retained a 45% interest and whose properties we manage for an ongoing fee. We invested $5 million of the proceeds to fund our 45% interest in the venture and received a short term promissory note of approximately $15 million. The note was repaid in 2001 and we used the proceeds to pay down our outstanding line of credit, freeing up working capital for acquisitions and expansions done in 2001. We may seek to sell additional Properties to similar joint venture programs or third parties in 2005. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our off balance sheet arrangements include an ownership interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC, which owns 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States, and an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses our headquarters and other tenants. In December 2000, we contributed seven self storage properties to Locke Sovran I, LLC with a fair market value of $19.8 million, in exchange for a $15 million one year note receivable bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which was repaid in 2001, and a 45% interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs income was $141,000, which is recorded as equity in income of joint ventures on our consolidated statements of income. We manage the storage facilities for Locke Sovran I, LLC and received fees of $322,000, $311,000, and $290,000, for the years ended 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. We also have a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2004. During 2004, Iskalo Office Holdings obtained long term financing and used the proceeds to repay the note payable to us of $1.4 million. Our remaining investment includes a capital contribution of $49. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs income was $27,000 and we received a distribution of $113,000. We paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $426,000 in 2004 and $393,000 in 2003, and $255,000 in 2002. Also, during 2004 and 2003 we purchased land from Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for $0.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. A summary of the off balance sheet arrangements financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 is as follows: (dollars in thousands) Locke Sovran I, LLC Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in storage facilities, net $ 38,798 $ Investment in office building 5,939 Other assets 1,637 739 Total Assets $ 40,435 $ 6,678 Due to the Company $ 2,593 $ Mortgage payable 29,755 7,627 Other liabilities 686 271 Total Liabilities 33,034 7,898 25 &lt;page&gt; Unaffiliated partners equity (deficiency) 4,014 (727) Company equity (deficiency) 3,387 (493) Total Liabilities and Partners Equity (deficiency) $ 40,435 $ 6,678 Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 6,441 $ 1,049 Total expenses 6,128 993 Net income $ 313 $ 56 We do not expect to have material future cash outlays relating to these joint ventures and we do not guarantee the debt of Locke Sovran I, LLC or Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. A summary of our cash flows arising from the two off balance sheet arrangements are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Statement of Operations Other income (management fees income) $322 $311 $290 General and administrative expenses (corporate office rent) 426 393 255 Equity in income (losses) of joint ventures 207 186 (15) Investing activities Reimbursement of advances to (advances to) joint ventures 958 (110) (2,118) Financing activities Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 602 646 1,032 REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2005 may be applied toward our 2004 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2004, our percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 96%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. 26 &lt;page&gt; INTEREST RATE RISK We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt. At December 31, 2004, we have three outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The first, entered into in March 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 5.36% through November 2005 on $50 million notional amount. The second, entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.485% through October 2006 on another $50 million notional amount. The third, also entered in September 2001, effectively fixes the LIBOR base rate at 4.805% through September 2008 on $30 million notional amount. We have an unsecured credit facility in place through September 2007 enabling us to borrow funds at rates of LIBOR plus 0.9%, an unsecured term note at rates of LIBOR plus 1.2% through September 2009, and an unsecured term note at rates of LIBOR plus 1.5% through September 2013. As a result of the above described interest rate swap agreements, we have fixed our interest rate through November 2005 on $43 million at 5.45%, and $7 million at 6.56%, through October 2006 on $50 million at 5.685%, and through September 2008 on $30 million at 6.005%. Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $130 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through November 2005, $210 million of our $243 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding debt of $243 million at December 31, 2004, a 1% increase in interest rates would have a $330,000 effect on our interest expense annually. The table below summarizes our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2004. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Value Line of credit variable rate LIBOR + 0.9% $43,000 $ 43,000 $ 43,000 Notes Payable: Term note variable rate LIBOR+1.20% $100,000 $ 100,000 $100,000 Term note variable rate LIBOR+1.50% $ 20,000 $ 20,000 $ 20,000 Term note fixed rate 6.26% $ 80,000 $ 80,000 $ 80,656 Mortgage note fixed rate 7.19% $ 809 $ 870 $ 936 $997 $ 1,081 $ 41,382 $ 46,075 $ 48,090 Interest rate derivatives $ 3,425 INFLATION We do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on our operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. 27 &lt;page&gt; SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because we increase rental rates on most of our storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51." The primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights ("variable interest entities") and how to determine when and which business enterprise (the "primary beneficiary") should consolidate the variable interest entity. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either (i) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest; or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires that the primary beneficiary, as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity, make additional disclosures. Certain disclosure requirements of FIN 46 were effective for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46 R") to address certain FIN 46 implementation issues. We have evaluated the impact of adopting FIN 46 R applicable to entities that are not special purpose entities created prior to February 1, 2003 and do not believe that any of our investments in joint ventures or partially owned subsidiaries require consolidation under the provisions of FIN46 R. Effective June 2003, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (Statement No. 150). Statement No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability. Many of these instruments were previously classified as equity. Statement No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 150 3, "Effective Date for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests un der SFAS 150", which defers certain provisions of Statement No. 150 as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The deferral is expected to remain in effect while those issues are addressed in either Phase II of the FASBs Liabilities and Equity project or Phase II of the Business Combination project. Adoption of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Statement 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt Statement 123(R) on July 1, 2005. 28 &lt;page&gt; As permitted by Statement 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using Opinion 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123(R)s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
