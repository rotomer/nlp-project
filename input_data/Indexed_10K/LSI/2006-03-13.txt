Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words "intends," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," and similar expressions are intended to identify "forward looking statements" within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of the Securities Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; our ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into our existing business and operations; our ability to effectively compete in the industry in which we do bus iness; our existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with our outstanding floating rate debt; our ability to successfully extend our truck move in program for new customers and Dri guard product roll out; our reliance on our call center; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We are the sixth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned or managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly trade name "Uncle Bobs Self Storage." Operating Strategy: Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: Operating performance continues to improve as a result of revenue drivers implemented by us over the past four years, including: The formation of our Customer Care Center, which answers sales inquiries and makes reservations for all of our properties on a centralized basis, The rollout of the Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 219 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers in moving into their spaces, and An increase in internet marketing and sales. In addition to increasing revenue, we have worked to improve services and amenities at our stores. While this has caused operating expenses to increase over the past four years, it has resulted in a superior storage experience for our customers. Our managers are better qualified and receive a significantly higher level of training than they did four years ago, customer access and security are greatly enhanced as a result of advances in technology, and property appearance and functionality has been improved. Our customized property management systems enable us to improve our ability to track trends, set optimal pricing levels, enjoy considerable economies of scale in vendor and supply pricing, and control collections and accounts receivable. 16 &lt;page&gt; B. Acquiring additional stores: In markets where we already operate facilities, we seek to acquire new stores one or two at a time from independent operators. By so doing, we can add to our existing base, which should improve market penetration in those areas, and contribute to the benefits achieved from economies of scale. We will seek to enter new markets if we can do so by acquiring a group of stores in those markets. We feel that our marketing efforts and control systems would enhance even those portfolios that have been managed efficiently by independent operators, and that attractive returns can be generated by such acquisitions. C. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: We intend to continue to install climate controlled and Dri guard space at select stores, providing our customers with better storage solutions and improving yields on our portfolio. We intend to add buildings to a number of our stores, providing additional rental units of a size and type to meet existing demand. We will seek to acquire parcels of land contiguous to some of our stores and add to the available rental space at those stores. We intend to modify existing buildings to better match size and type of rental units to existing demand. At some stores, this may be as simple as reconfiguring walls and doors; at others, it may entail rebuilding in a configuration more in tune with market conditions. As announced in 2004, we have begun to implement a program that will add 450,000 to 600,000 square feet of rentable space at existing stores and convert up to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to premium (climate and humidity controlled) space. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at between $32 and $40 million. Funding is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings on the Companys line of credit, and issuance of common shares in our Dividend Reinvestment Program and Stock Purchase Plan. Supply and Demand We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. However, the historically low interest rates available to developers over the past three years have resulted in increased supply on a national basis. We have experienced some of this excess supply in certain markets in Texas and New England, but because of the demand model, we have not seen a widespread effect on our stores. We have also observed an increase in the sales price of existing facilities as a result of the low interest rates, such that the capitalization rates on acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) have decreased from approximately 10% five years ago to 7.5% today. In 2004, we took advantage of these favorable capitalization rates by selling five stores for a gain of $1.1 million. With interest rates now on the rise we expect the trend of decreasing capitalization rates to reverse in the coming years and are forecasting acquisitions of $100 million in 2006. Operating Trends In 2005, the overall economy and our industry gained momentum from the recovery that commenced in 2003. We experienced same store revenue growth of approximately 5% in each of the last three years. We attribute the same store growth to implementation of the call center, the free truck program for new move in customers, use of improved technology and practices in the management of our rental rates and, to a lesser degree, general economic factors. We expect conditions in most of our markets to remain stable and are forecasting 5% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2006. 17 &lt;page&gt; Expenses related to operating a self storage facility have increased substantially over the last five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). We expect the trend of increasing costs to continue at a moderate pace and, while current operating margins are expected to be sustained, it is unlikely that much improvement in operating margins will be seen in the coming years as a result of cost reductions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions o r conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow or significant declining revenue per storage facility. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values ar e not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 We recorded rental revenues of $133.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $14.3 million or 11.9% when compared to 2004 rental revenues of $119.6 million. Of this increase, $6.4 million resulted from a 5.5% increase in rental revenues at the 250 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2004). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units, and a slight occupancy increase, which we believe resulted from improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the availability of rental trucks at 219 of our stores. The remaining $7.9 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of fourteen stores during 2005 and from having the 2004 acquisitions included for a full year of operati ons. Other income increased $0.8 million due to increased merchandise and insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. 18 &lt;page&gt; Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.2 million or 12.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. Of this increase, $3.4 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2005 and from having the 2004 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $1.8 million of the increase was due to increased personnel, utilities, maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 250 core properties considered same stores. We also incurred approximately $0.3 million of uninsured losses relating to the hurricanes that hit the United States in 2005 as compared to $0.7 million uninsured losses from hurricanes in 2004. We expect the trend of increasing operating costs to continue at a moderate pace with upward pressure related to utilities and property insurance costs. General and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million or 16.2% from 2004 to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from bonuses earned by our home office personnel including our executive officers, increased costs in our call center, and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2005 and 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $21.2 million in 2005 from $19.2 million in 2004, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2005 and a full year of depreciation on 2004 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $49.9 million in 2004 to $55.9 million in 2005 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $18.1 million in 2004 to $20.2 million in 2005 as a result of higher interest additional borrowings under our line of credit to purchase fourteen stores in 2005. During 2004, the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $11.7 million, resulting in a gain of $1.1 million. The operations of these five facilities and the gain on sale in 2004 are reported as discontinued operations. No storage facilities were sold in 2005. The decrease in preferred stock dividends from 2004 to 2005 was a result of the redemption of all 1,200,000 outstanding shares of our 9.85% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock in August of 2004 and the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock to 920,244 shares of common stock in 2005. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 We recorded rental revenues of $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $11.1 million or 10.2% when compared to 2003 rental revenues of $108.5 million. Of this increase, $5.3 million resulted from a 5% increase in rental revenues at the 244 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2003). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units, and a slight occupancy increase, which we believe resulted from improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the availability of rental trucks at 207 of our stores. The remaining $5.8 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of ten stores during 2004 and from having the 2003 acquisitions included for a full year of operation s. Other income increased $0.8 million due to increased insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $4.7 million or 12.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Of this increase, $2.1 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2004 and from having the 2003 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $1.9 million of the increase was due to increased insurance, personnel, truck, and maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 244 core properties considered same stores. We also incurred approximately $0.7 million of uninsured losses relating to the four hurricanes that hit the Eastern United States in 2004. General and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million or 15.1% from 2003 to 2004. The increase primarily resulted from increased costs in our call center, professional fees related to the documentation, analysis, and testing of internal controls required by Sarbanes Oxley Section 404, and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2004 and 2003. 19 &lt;page&gt; Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $19.2 million in 2004 from $17.8 million in 2003, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2004 and a full year of depreciation on 2003 acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $45.5 million in 2003 to $49.9 million in 2004 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $16.0 million in 2003 to $18.1 million in 2004 as a result of higher interest rates associated with the fixed rate debt entered into in September 2003 and additional borrowings under our line of credit to purchase ten stores in 2004. On August 2, 2004, we redeemed all 1,200,000 outstanding shares of our 9.85% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for $30 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares. The excess of the redemption amount over the carrying value of the Series B Preferred Stock was $1.4 million and has been shown as a reduction in net income available to common shareholders. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations ("FFO") provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income $34,790 $32,004 $28,423 $ 26,301 $ 24,189 Minority interest in income 1,529 1,542 1,790 1,990 1,617 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 21,222 19,175 17,856 16,207 13,839 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 90 293 290 283 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 484 473 460 400 633 Gain on sale of real estate (1,137) Preferred stock dividends (4,123) (7,168) (8,818) (4,863) (2,955) 20 &lt;page&gt; Redemption amount in excess of carrying value of Series B Preferred Stock (1,415) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Operating Partnership (1,519) (1,333) (1,563) (1,647) (2,333) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Locke Sovran II (1,499) (1,475) (1,539) (1,645) (125) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $50,884 $40,756 $36,902 $ 37,033 $ 35,148 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through September 2007, at which time our revolving line of credit matures unless renewed at our option for one additional year. Cash flows from operating activities were $60.2 million, $53.9 million and $51.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase for each year is primarily attributable to increased net income and increased non cash charges for depreciation and amortization. Cash used in investing activities was $79.2 million, $71.0 million, and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in cash used from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to increased acquisition activity in 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was due to the proceeds from the sale of 5 facilities in 2004 that offset the acquisition activity that was comparable in these two years. Cash provided by financing activities was $20.7 million in 2005 compared to uses of $0.2 million and $2.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. On September 4, 2003, we entered into agreements relating to new unsecured credit arrangements, and received funds under those arrangements. In December 2004, the agreements were amended by increasing the line of credit availability from $75 million to $100 million (expandable to $200 million), reducing the interest rate from LIBOR plus 1.375% to LIBOR plus 0.90%, increasing the maturity by one year to September 2007, and retaining a one year extension option. In addition, the line of credit requires a facility fee of 0.20%. At December 31, 2005, there was $10 million available on our line of credit. The amendment also reduced the interest rate on the $100 million term note from LIBOR plus 1.50% to LIBOR plus 1.20%, and extended the matur ity by one year to September 2009. In addition to the line of credit and term note mentioned above, in 2003 we also issued a $80 million unsecured term note bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26% and a $20 million unsecured term note bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. The term notes mature September 2013. The line of credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ) and Fitch (BBB ). In January 2006, we entered into a $25 million term note with a bank bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.20% and maturing July 2006. Our intention is to replace this term note and to pay down our revolving line of credit with $100 to $150 million of 10 year term notes prior to July 2006. Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all covenants. In February 2002, the consolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran II, LLC) entered into a mortgage note of $48 million. The note is secured by the 27 properties owned by the joint venture with a carrying value of 21 &lt;page&gt; $72.9 million and $73.9 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 10 year note bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.19%. In July 1999, we issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. We redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock on August 2, 2004 at a total cost of $30 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D 42, "The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock", we recorded a reduction of $1.4 million from 2004 net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders relating to the difference between the Series B Preferred Stock carrying value and the redemption amount. On July 3, 2002, we entered into an agreement providing for the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 379,166 shares of common stock at $32.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. The offering price was $25.00 per share and the net proceeds of $67.9 million were used to reduce indebtedness that was incurred in the June 2002 acquisition of seven self storage properties and to repay a portion of our borrowings under the line of credit. During 2005, we issued 920,244 shares of our common stock in connection with a written notice from one of the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock requesting the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. In 2004, we issued 306,748 shares of our common stock in connection the conversion of 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. All conver ted shares of Series C Preferred Stock were retired leaving 1,200,000 shares outstanding at December 31, 2005. During 2005 and 2004, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2005, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. During 2005, we issued 426,172 shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plan. We realized $15.2 million from the sale of such shares. We expect to issue shares when our share price and capital needs warrant such issuance. Future acquisitions, share repurchases and repayment of the credit line are expected to be funded with the revolving line of credit, issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 and thereafter Line of credit $ 90.0 million $ 90.0 million Term notes $ 200.0 million $ 100.0 million $ 100.0 million Mortgages payable $ 49.1 million $ 1.0 million $ 2.2 million $ 2.5 million $ 43.4 million Interest payments $ 96.0 million $20.2 million $ 33.5 million $ 22.3 million $ 20.0 million Building lease $ 2.1 million $ 0.5 million $ 0.9 million $ 0.7 million Total $ 437.2 million $21.7 million $126.6 million $ 125.5 million $ 163.4 million 22 &lt;page&gt; ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2005, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire fourteen Properties in Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas comprising one million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2004, we used operating cash flow and borrowings pursuant to the line of credit to acquire ten Properties in Connecticut, Florida, Tennessee, and Texas comprising one million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2003, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire two Properties in Texas comprising 148,098 square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. At December 31, 2005, we owned and or operated 285 self storage facilities in 21 states. Of these facilities, 11 are managed by us for Locke Sovran I, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand in new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. At December 31, 2005, we were in negotiations to acquire eleven stores for approximately $33 million. Five of these stores were purchased in January and February 2006 for $18.9 million. In addition, as announced in 2004, we have begun to implement a program that will add 450,000 to 600,000 square feet of rentable space at existing stores and convert up to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to premium (climate and humidity controlled) space. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at between $32 and $40 million. Funding of these and the above mentioned improvements is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings under our line of credit, and issuance of common shares through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We also expect to accelerate, by two to three years, the required capital expenditures on 50 to 70 of our Properties. This includes repainting, paving, and remodeling of the office buildings at these facilities. Typically we spend $4 to $5 million per year on such improvements; for 2006 and 2007, we expect to spend approximately $15 million per year. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2004, as part of an asset management program, we sold five non strategic storage facilities located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio, and South Carolina to unaffiliated parties for $11.7 million resulting in a net gain of $1.1 million. No sales took place in 2005. Also, during 2001, we sold eight Properties for approximately $24.5 million to Locke Sovran II, LLC. Because Locke Sovran II, LLC is a consolidated joint venture, no gain was recognized on the sale. We may seek to sell additional Properties to similar joint venture programs or third parties in 2006. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our off balance sheet arrangements include an ownership interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC, which owns 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States, and an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses our headquarters and other tenants. In December 2000, we contributed seven self storage properties to Locke Sovran I, LLC with a fair market value of $19.8 million, in exchange for a $15 million one year note receivable bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which was repaid in 2001, and a 45% interest in Locke Sovran I, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs income was $171,000, which is recorded as equity in income of joint 23 &lt;page&gt; ventures on our consolidated statements of income. We manage the storage facilities for Locke Sovran I, LLC and received fees of $332,000, $322,000, and $311,000, for the years ended 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We also have a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2005. During 2004, Iskalo Ofice Holdings obtained long term financing and used the proceeds to repay the note payable to us of $1.4 million. Our remaining investment includes a capital contribution of $49. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs loss was $8,000. We paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $445,000 in 2005 and $426,000 in 2004, and $393,000 in 2003. Also, during 2004 and 2003 we purchased land from Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for $0.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. A summary of the off balance sheet arrangements financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 is as follows: (dollars in thousands) Locke Sovran I, LLC Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in storage facilities, net $ 38,226 $ Investment in office building 6,057 Other assets 1,398 626 Total Assets $ 39,624 $ 6,683 Due to the Company $ 2,780 $ Mortgage payable 29,463 7,522 Other liabilities 704 350 Total Liabilities 32,947 7,872 Unaffiliated partners equity (deficiency) 3,609 (688) Company equity (deficiency) 3,068 (501) Total Liabilities and Partners Equity (deficiency) $ 39,624 $ 6,683 Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 6,648 $ 1,137 Total expenses 6,268 1,154 Net income (loss) $ 380 $ (17) We do not expect to have material future cash outlays relating to these joint ventures and we do not guarantee the debt of Locke Sovran I, LLC or Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. A summary of our cash flows arising from the two off balance sheet arrangements are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Statement of Operations Other income (management fees income) $ 332 $ 322 $ 311 General and administrative expenses (corporate office rent) 445 426 393 Equity in income of joint ventures 202 207 186 Investing activities (Advances to) reimbursement of advances to joint ventures (187) 958 (110) Financing activities Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 490 602 646 24 &lt;page&gt; REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2006 may be applied toward our 2005 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2005, our percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 96%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. INTEREST RATE RISK We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt. At December 31, 2005, we have five outstanding interest rate swap agreements as summarized below: Notional Amount Effective Date Expiration Date Fixed Rate Paid Floating Rate Received $50 Million 9/28/01 10/2/06 5.685% 1 month LIBOR $30 Million 9/28/01 9/30/08 5.705% 1 month LIBOR $50 Million 11/14/05 9/1/09 5.590% 1 month LIBOR $20 Million 9/4/05 9/4/13 5.935% 6 month LIBOR $50 Million forward start 10/10/06 9/1/09 5.680% 1 month LIBOR Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $150 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through September 2008, $230 million of our $290 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding unsecured debt of $290 million at December 31, 2005, a 1% increase in interest rates would have a $600,000 effect on our interest expense annually. The table below summarizes our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2005. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange. 25 &lt;page&gt; Expected Maturity Date Fair 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Value Line of credit variable rate LIBOR + 0.9% $90,000 $ 90,000 $ 90,000 Notes Payable: Term note variable rate LIBOR+1.20% $100,000 $100,000 $100,000 Term note variable rate LIBOR+1.50% $ 20,000 $ 20,000 $ 20,000 Term note fixed rate 6.26% $ 80,000 $ 80,000 $ 81,003 Mortgage note fixed rate 7.19% $ 870 $ 936 $ 997 $ 1,081 $ 1,163 $ 40,208 $ 45,255 $ 48,471 Mortgage note fixed rate 5.40% $ 120 $ 126 $ 133 $ 141 $ 149 $ 3,220 $ 3,889 $ 3,824 Interest rate derivatives asset $ 1,411 INFLATION We do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on our operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because we increase rental rates on most of our storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. Interpretation 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. However, the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Interpretation 47 requires that the uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Interpretation 47 is effective no later th an for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005 (December 31, 2005 for the Company). The application of Interpretation 47 does not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Statement 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006. 26 &lt;page&gt; As permitted by Statement 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using Opinion 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123(R)s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the EITFs consensus on Issue No. 04 5 "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." This consensus established the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership (or similar entity like an LLC) regardless of the extent of the general partners ownership interest in the limited partnership. The consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners, if the limited partners have either (a) the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or (b) substantive participating rights. EITF 04 5 is effective for all agreements entered into or modified after June 29 , 2005. For pre existing agreements that are not modified, the consensus is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect that the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Item 7A.
