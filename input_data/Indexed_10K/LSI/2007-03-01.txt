Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words intends, believes, expects, anticipates, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of the Securities Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; our ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into our existing business and operations; our ability to effectively compete in the industry in which we do business; our existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with our outstanding floating rate debt; our ability to successfully extend our truck move in program for new customers and Dri guard product roll out; our reliance on our call center; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We believe we are the fifth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned and managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly name Uncle Bobs Self Storage. Operating Strategy: Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: Operating performance continues to improve as a result of revenue drivers implemented by us over the past five years, including: The formation of our Customer Care Center, which answers sales inquiries and makes reservations for all of our properties on a centralized basis, The rollout of the Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 248 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers in moving into their spaces, and An increase in internet marketing and sales. In addition to increasing revenue, we have worked to improve services and amenities at our stores. While this has caused operating expenses to increase over the past five years, it has resulted in a superior storage experience for our customers. Our managers are better qualified and receive a significantly higher level of training than they did five years ago, customer access and security are greatly enhanced as a result of advances in technology, and property appearance and functionality have been improved. Our customized property management systems enable us to improve our ability to track trends, set optimal pricing levels, enjoy considerable economies of scale in vendor and supply pricing, and control collections and accounts receivable. 17 Table of Contents B. Acquiring additional stores: In markets where we already operate facilities, we seek to acquire new stores one or two at a time from independent operators. By so doing, we can add to our existing base, which should improve market penetration in those areas, and contribute to the benefits achieved from economies of scale. We will seek to enter new markets if we can do so by acquiring a group of stores in those markets. We feel that our marketing efforts and control systems would enhance even those portfolios that have been managed efficiently by independent operators, and that attractive returns can be generated by such acquisitions. C. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: We intend to continue to install climate controlled and Dri guard space at select stores, providing our customers with better storage solutions and improving yields on our portfolio. We intend to add buildings to a number of our stores, providing additional rental units of a size and type to meet existing demand. We will seek to acquire parcels of land contiguous to some of our stores and add to the available rental space at those stores. We intend to modify existing buildings to better match size and type of rental units to existing demand. At some stores, this may be as simple as reconfiguring walls and doors; at others, it may entail rebuilding in a configuration more in tune with market conditions. As announced in 2004, we have begun to implement a program that will add 450,000 to 600,000 square feet of rentable space at existing stores and convert up to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to premium (climate and humidity controlled) space. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at between $32 and $40 million. During 2006 we spent approximately $12.6 million on revenue enhancing improvements. Funding is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings on the Companys line of credit, and issuance of common shares in our Dividend Reinvestment Program and Stock Purchase Plan. Supply and Demand We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. However, the historically low interest rates available to developers over the past four years have resulted in increased supply on a national basis. We have experienced some of this excess supply in certain markets in Texas and New England, but because of the demand model, we have not seen a widespread effect on our stores. We have also observed an increase in the sales price of existing facilities as a result of the low interest rates, such that the capitalization rates on acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) have decreased from approximately 10% six years ago to 7.25% today. In 2004, we took advantage of these favorable capitalization rates by selling five stores for a gain of $1.1 million. With the increase in interest rates over the last year we have seen capitalization rates level off at approximately 7.25% and are forecasting acquisitions of $100 million in 2007. Operating Trends In 2006, our industry had another good year as the overall economy remained strong and our industry continued the momentum from the recovery that commenced in 2003. We experienced same store revenue growth of approximately 5% in each of the last four years. We attribute the same store growth to implementation of the call center, the free truck program for new move in customers, use of improved technology and practices in the management of our rental rates and, to a lesser degree, general economic factors. We expect conditions in most of our markets to remain stable and are forecasting 4% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2007. 18 Table of Contents Expenses related to operating a self storage facility have increased substantially over the last five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). We expect the trend of increasing costs to continue at a moderate pace and, while current operating margins are expected to be sustained, it is unlikely that much improvement in operating margins will be seen in the coming years as a result of cost reductions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow or significant declining revenue per storage facility. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 We recorded rental revenues of $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $27.1 million or 20.2% when compared to 2005 rental revenues of $133.9 million. As of April 1, 2006, the consolidated income statement includes the results of a previously unconsolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran I, LLC) that has been consolidated as a result of an additional investment in that entity by us. The rental income related to Locke Sovran I that was included in our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $5.1 million. Of the remaining $22.0 million increase in rental income, $6.6 million resulted from a 5.2% increase in rental revenues at the 255 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2005 that were at a stable occupancy). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units averaging 3.8%, and a slight occupancy increase, which we believe resulted from improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the increased demand in areas damaged by the 2005 hurricanes. The remaining $15.4 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of 42 stores during 2006 and from having the 2005 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.9 million due to increased merchandise and insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. 19 Table of Contents Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $10.9 million, or 22.6%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Of this increase, $6.5 million were expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in 2006 and from having expenses from the 2005 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $2.6 million of the increase was due to increased property insurance, utilities, maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 255 core properties considered same stores. The consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC as of April 1, 2006 resulted in a $1.8 million increase in property operating and real estate tax expense in 2006. We expect the trend of increasing operating costs to continue at a moderate to high pace primarily attributable to utilities and property insurance costs. General and administrative expenses increased $1.2 million or 9.6% from 2005 to 2006. The increase primarily resulted from the costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2006 and 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $25.3 million in 2006 from $21.2 million in 2005, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2006, a full year of depreciation on 2005 acquisitions, and the consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC. Income from operations increased from $55.9 million in 2005 to $67.6 million in 2006 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $20.2 million in 2005 to $29.5 million in 2006 as a result of higher interest rates, additional borrowings under our line of credit and term notes to purchase 42 stores in 2006, and the consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC as of April 1, 2006. The decrease in preferred stock dividends from 2005 to 2006 was a result of the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock into 920,244 shares of common stock in 2005. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 We recorded rental revenues of $133.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $14.3 million or 11.9% when compared to 2004 rental revenues of $119.6 million. Of this increase, $6.4 million resulted from a 5.5% increase in rental revenues at the 250 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2004). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units, and a slight occupancy increase, which we believe resulted from improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the availability of rental trucks at 219 of our stores. The remaining $7.9 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of fourteen stores during 2005 and from having the 2004 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.8 million due to increased merchandise and insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.2 million or 12.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. Of this increase, $3.4 million was incurred by the facilities acquired in 2005 and from having the 2004 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $1.8 million of the increase was due to increased personnel, utilities, maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 250 core properties considered same stores. We also incurred approximately $0.3 million of uninsured losses relating to the hurricanes that hit the United States in 2005 as compared to $0.7 million uninsured losses from hurricanes in 2004. We expect the trend of increasing operating costs to continue at a moderate pace with upward pressure related to utilities and property insurance costs. General and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million or 16.2% from 2004 to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from bonuses earned by our home office personnel including our executive officers, increased costs in our call center, and the increased costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2005 and 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $21.2 million in 2005 from $19.2 million in 2004, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2005 and a full year of depreciation on 2004 acquisitions. 20 Table of Contents Income from operations increased from $49.9 million in 2004 to $55.9 million in 2005 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $18.1 million in 2004 to $20.2 million in 2005 as a result of higher interest additional borrowings under our line of credit to purchase fourteen stores in 2005. During 2004, the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $11.7 million, resulting in a gain of $1.1 million. The operations of these five facilities and the gain on sale in 2004 are reported as discontinued operations. No storage facilities were sold in 2005. The decrease in preferred stock dividends from 2004 to 2005 was a result of the redemption of all 1,200,000 outstanding shares of our 9.85% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock in August of 2004 and the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock to 920,244 shares of common stock in 2005. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations (FFO) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT) as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 36,610 $ 34,790 $ 32,004 $ 28,423 $ 26,301 Minority interest in income 2,434 1,529 1,542 1,790 1,990 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 25,305 21,222 19,175 17,856 16,207 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 90 293 290 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 168 484 473 460 400 Gain on sale of real estate (1,137 ) Preferred stock dividends (2,512 ) (4,123 ) (7,168 ) (8,818 ) (4,863 ) Redemption amount in excess of carrying value of Series B Preferred Stock (1,415 ) 21 Table of Contents For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Operating Partnership (1,450 ) (1,519 ) (1,333 ) (1,563 ) (1,647 ) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Locke Sovran I and Locke Sovran II (1,785 ) (1,499 ) (1,475 ) (1,539 ) (1,645 ) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $ 58,770 $ 50,884 $ 40,756 $ 36,902 $ 37,033 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through September 2007, at which time our revolving line of credit matures unless renewed at our option for one additional year. Cash flows from operating activities were $64.5 million, $60.2 million and $53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increase for each year is primarily attributable to increased net income and increased non cash charges for depreciation and amortization. These increases were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses mainly relating to property insurance premiums. Cash used in investing activities was $176.6 million, $79.2 million, and $71.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively. The increase in cash used from 2004 to 2005 was attributable to increased acquisition activity in 2005. The increase from 2005 to 2006 was due to increased acquisition activity, an increase in improvements to existing facilities, and additional investment in our consolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $154.9 million in 2006 compared to $20.7 million in 2005 and uses of $0.2 million in 2004, respectively. In April 2006, the Company entered into a $150 million unsecured term note maturing in April 2016 bearing interest at 6.38%. The proceeds from this term note were used to pay down the outstanding balance on the Companys line of credit, to repay a $25 million term note entered in January 2006 and a $15 million term note entered in April 2006, and to make an additional investment into Locke Sovran I, LLC and Locke Sovran II, LLC (consolidated joint ventures). In December 2006, we issued 2.3 million shares of our common stock and realized net proceeds of $122.4 million. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the entire outstanding balance on our line of credit that had been drawn on to finance acquisitions subsequent to April 2006. The remaining proceeds from the common stock offering will be used to fund 2007 acquisitions. We have a $100 million (expandable to $200 million) unsecured line of credit that matures in September 2007 and a $100 million unsecured term note that matures in September 2009. We have the right to extend the term of the credit line until September 2008. The line of credit bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.90% and requires a 0.20% facility fee. The term note bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.20%. We also maintain a $80 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26% and a $20 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. At December 31, 2006, there was $100 million available on the revolving line of credit, excluding the amount available on the expansion feature. The line of credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ) and Fitch (BBB ). Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants. In addition to the unsecured financing mentioned above, our consolidated financial statements also include $112.0 million of mortgages payable as detailed below: 22 Table of Contents * 7.80% mortgage note due December 2011, secured by 11 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran I) with an aggregate net book value of $41.6 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2006 on this mortgage was $29.5 million. * 7.19% mortgage note due March 2012, secured by 27 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran II) with an aggregate net book value of $78.4 million, principal and interest paid monthly.

The outstanding balance at December 31, 2006 on this mortgage was $1.0 million. * 6.35% mortgage note due March 2014, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $1.9 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2006 on this mortgage was $1.1 million. * 5.55% mortgage notes due November 2009, secured by 8 self storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of $36.2 million, interest only paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 6.44%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2006 on this mortgage was $25.5 million. * 7.50% mortgage notes due August 2011, secured by 3 self storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of $14.9 million, principal and interest paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 6.42%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2006 on this mortgage was $6.5 million. The 7.80% and 7.19% mortgages were incurred in 2001 and 2002 respectively as part of the financing of the consolidated joint ventures. The Company assumed the 7.25%, 6.76%, 6.35%, 5.55% and 7.5% mortgage notes in connection with the acquisitions of storage facilities in 2005 and 2006. In July 1999, we issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. We redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock on August 2, 2004 at a total cost of $30 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D 42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock, we recorded a reduction of $1.4 million from 2004 net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders relating to the difference between the Series B Preferred Stock carrying value and the redemption amount. On July 3, 2002, we entered into an agreement providing for the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 379,166 shares of common stock at $32.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. The offering price was $25.00 per share and the net proceeds of $67.9 million were used to reduce indebtedness that was incurred in the June 2002 acquisition of seven self storage properties and to repay a portion of our borrowings under the line of credit. During 2005, we issued 920,244 shares of our common stock in connection with a written notice from one of the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock requesting the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. In 2004, we issued 306,748 shares of our common stock in connection the conversion of 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. All converted shares of Series C Preferred Stock were retired leaving 1,200,000 shares outstanding at December 31, 2006. During 2006 and 2005, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2006, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. During 2006, we issued 501,089 shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plan. We realized $24.9 million from the sale of such shares. We expect to issue shares when our share price and capital needs warrant such issuance. Future acquisitions, share repurchases and repayment of the credit line are expected to be funded with the remaining proceeds from the December 2006 common stock issuance, draws on the revolving line of credit, 23 Table of Contents issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and thereafter Line of credit Term notes $ 350.0 million $ 100.0 million $ 250.0 million Mortgages payable $ 112.0 million $ 1.6 million $ 29.1 million $ 40.2 million $ 41.1 million Interest payments $ 179.4 million $ 30.5 million $ 52.7 million $ 43.2 million $ 53.0 million Land lease $ 1.2 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.9 million Building lease $ 1.5 million $ 0.5 million $ 1.0 million Total $ 644.1 million $ 32.7 million $ 182.9 million $ 83.5 million $ 345.0 million ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2006, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, borrowings under the $150 million 10 year term note, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire 42 Properties in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee, and Texas comprising 2.6 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2005, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire fourteen Properties in Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas comprising one million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2004, we used operating cash flow and borrowings pursuant to the line of credit to acquire ten Properties in Connecticut, Florida, Tennessee, and Texas comprising one million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. At December 31, 2006, we owned and operated 327 self storage facilities in 22 states. Of these facilities, 38 are managed by us for two consolidated joint ventures of which we are a majority owner. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand into new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. At December 31, 2006, we were in negotiations to acquire ten stores for approximately $31 million. One of these stores was purchased in January 2007 for $5.6 million. In addition, as announced in 2004, we have begun to implement a program that will add 450,000 to 600,000 square feet of rentable space at existing stores and convert up to an additional 250,000 to 300,000 square feet to premium (climate and humidity controlled) space. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at between $32 and $40 million. During 2006 we spent approximately $12.6 million on revenue enhancing improvements. Funding of these and the above mentioned improvements is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings under our line of credit, and issuance of common shares through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We also expect to accelerate, by two to three years, the required capital expenditures on 50 to 70 of our Properties. This includes repainting, paving, and remodeling of the office buildings at these facilities. For 2006 we spent approximately $17 million on such improvements and we expect to spend approximately $18 million in 2007. 24 Table of Contents DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2004, as part of an asset management program, we sold five non strategic storage facilities located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio, and South Carolina to unaffiliated parties for $11.7 million resulting in a net gain of $1.1 million. No sales took place in 2005 or 2006. Also, during 2001, we sold eight Properties for approximately $24.5 million to Locke Sovran II, LLC. Because Locke Sovran II, LLC is a consolidated joint venture, no gain was recognized on the sale. We may seek to sell additional Properties to similar joint venture programs or third parties in 2007. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our off balance sheet arrangement includes an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses our headquarters and other tenants. The Company has a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2006. During 2004, Iskalo Office Holdings obtained long term financing and used the proceeds to repay the note payable to the Company of $1.1 million. The Companys remaining investment includes a capital contribution of $49. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Companys share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs income (loss) was $80,000 and ($8,000), respectively. The Company paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $583,000, $445,000 and $426,000 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under the lease are $0.6 million per year through 2009. Also, the Company purchased land from Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for $0.4 million and $1.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In April 2006, the Company made an additional investment of $2.8 million in a former off balance sheet arrangement known as Locke Sovran I, LLC that increased the Companys ownership to over 70%. As a result of this transaction the Company has consolidated the results of operations of Locke Sovran I, LLC in its financial statements since April 1, 2006, the date that it acquired its controlling interest. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Companys share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs income was $171,000 and $141,000, respectively, and the amortization of the deferred gain was $40,000, each of which are recorded as equity in income of joint ventures on the consolidated statements of operations for those years. The Company manages the storage facilities for Locke Sovran I, LLC and received fees of $332,000, and $322,000 for the years ended 2005, and 2004. Locke Sovran I, LLC, owns 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States. A summary of the unconsolidated joint ventures financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 is as follows: Iskalo Office (dollars in thousands) Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in office building $ 5,842 Other assets 808 Total Assets $ 6,650 Mortgage payable $ 7,410 Other liabilities 253 Total Liabilities 7,663 Unaffiliated partners deficiency (592 ) Company deficiency (421 ) Total Liabilities and Partners Deficiency $ 6,650 25 Table of Contents Iskalo Office (dollars in thousands) Holdings, LLC Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 1,351 Total expenses 1,189 Net income $ 162 We do not expect to have material future cash outlays relating to this joint venture and we do not guarantee the debt of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. A summary of our cash flows arising from the off balance sheet arrangements with Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for the three years ended December 31, 2006, and with Locke Sovran I, LLC for the two years ended December 31, 2005 and for the three months ended March 31, 2006 (the date it has been included in our consolidated results of operations) are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Statement of Operations Other income (management fees income) $ 85 $ 332 $ 322 General and administrative expenses (corporate office rent) 583 445 426 Equity in income of joint ventures 172 202 207 Investing activities Reimbursement of advances to (advances to) joint ventures 17 (187 ) 958 Financing activities Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 123 490 602 REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2007 may be applied toward our 2006 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2006, our percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 98%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. INTEREST RATE RISK We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt. At December 31, 2006, we have three outstanding interest rate swap agreements as summarized below: Fixed Floating Rate Notional Amount Effective Date Expiration Date Rate Paid Received $50 Million 11/14/05 9/1/09 5.590 % 1 month LIBOR $20 Million 9/4/05 9/4/13 5.935 % 6 month LIBOR $50 Million 10/10/06 9/1/09 5.680 % 1 month LIBOR 26 Table of Contents Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $120 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through September 2009, all of our $350 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding unsecured debt of $350 million at December 31, 2006, a 1% increase in interest rates would have no effect on our interest expense annually. The table below summarizes our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2006. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.

Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because we increase rental rates on most of our storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. 27 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under Statement 123(R). The Company adopted Statement 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and uses the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, the Company will recognize compensation cost in the financial statements issued subsequent to January 1, 2006 for all share based payments granted, modified, or settled after the date of adoption as well as for any awards that were granted prior to the adoption date for which the requisite service period has not been completed as of the adoption date. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R) non vested shares issued to employees and non employee directors were recorded as unearned compensation (a component of stockholders equity), at an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Upon the adoption of FAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, the non vested stock balance of approximately $1.8 million was reclassified as additional paid in capital. Under the provisions of FAS 123(R), compensation expense and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital are recorded for non vested share grants on a straight line basis as the restriction periods lapse. As a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R), the Company recorded compensation expense of $119,000 related to stock options. The adoption of FAS 123(R) did not have a significant impact on the determination of compensation expense related to non vested stock grants. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. Interpretation 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. However, the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Interpretation 47 requires that the uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Interpretation 47 was effective December 31, 2005 for the Company. The application of Interpretation 47 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the EITFs consensus on Issue No. 04 5 Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. This consensus established the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership (or similar entity such as an LLC) regardless of the extent of the general partners ownership interest in the limited partnership. The consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners, if the limited partners have either (a) the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or (b) substantive participating rights. EITF 04 5 is effective for all agreements entered into or modified after June 29, 2005. For pre existing agreements that are not modified, the consensus was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 requires a new evaluation process for all tax positions taken. If the probability for sustaining said tax position is greater than 50%, then the tax position is warranted and recognition should be at the highest amount which would be expected to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Interpretation 48 requires expanded disclosure at each annual reporting period unless a significant change occurs in an interim period. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of Interpretation 48 and the amounts reported after adoption are to be accounted for as an adjustment to the beginning 28 Table of Contents balance of retained earnings. The Company has completed its initial evaluation of the impact of the January 1, 2007, adoption of Interpretation 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results from operations.
