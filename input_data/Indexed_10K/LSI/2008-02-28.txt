Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words intends, believes, expects, anticipates, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and in Section 21F of the Securities Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; our ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into our existing business and operations; our ability to effectively compete in the industry in which we do business; our existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with our outstanding floating rate debt; our reliance on our call center; our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We believe we are the fifth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned and managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly name Uncle Bobs Self Storage. Operating Strategy: Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: Operating performance continues to improve as a result of revenue drivers implemented by us over the past five years, including: The formation of our Customer Care Center, which answers sales inquiries and makes reservations for all of our properties on a centralized basis, The rollout of the Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 262 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers in moving into their spaces, and An increase in internet marketing and sales. In addition to increasing revenue, we have worked to improve services and amenities at our stores. While this has caused operating expenses to increase over the past five years, it has resulted in a superior storage experience for our customers. Our managers are better qualified and receive a significantly higher level of training than they did five years ago, customer access and security are greatly enhanced as a result of advances in technology, and property appearance and functionality have been improved. Our customized property management systems enable us to improve our ability to track trends, set optimal pricing levels, enjoy considerable economies of scale in vendor and supply pricing, and control collections and accounts receivable. 18 Table of Contents B. Acquiring additional stores: In markets where we already operate facilities, we seek to acquire new stores one or two at a time from independent operators. By so doing, we can add to our existing base, which should improve market penetration in those areas, and contribute to the benefits achieved from economies of scale. We will seek to enter new markets if we can do so by acquiring a group of stores in those markets. We feel that our marketing efforts and control systems would enhance even those portfolios that have been managed efficiently by independent operators, and that attractive returns can be generated by such acquisitions. C. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: We intend to continue to install climate controlled and Dri guard space at select stores, providing our customers with better storage solutions and improving yields on our portfolio. We intend to add buildings to a number of our stores, providing additional rental units of a size and type to meet existing demand. We will seek to acquire parcels of land contiguous to some of our stores and add to the available rental space at those stores. We intend to modify existing buildings to better match size and type of rental units to existing demand. At some stores, this may be as simple as reconfiguring walls and doors; at others, it may entail rebuilding in a configuration more in tune with market conditions. Over the past three years, we have undertaken an announced program of expanding and enhancing our properties. Primarily, we have worked to add premium storage (i.e., air conditioned and or humidity controlled) space to our portfolio. In 2006, we expended approximately $12.6 million to add some 290,000 square feet of such space to our properties; in 2007, we spent approximately $25 million to add 444,000 square feet. The program entails construction of new buildings, acquisition of parcels of land contiguous to stores deemed suitable for expansion, and demolition of certain structures to make room for more optimally configured spaces. In 2008, we expect to continue this program, spending as much as $50 million to add up to 700,000 square feet of additional space to our existing stores. Supply and Demand We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. However, the historically low interest rates available to developers over the past four years have resulted in increased supply on a national basis. We have experienced some of this excess supply in certain markets in Texas and Florida, but because of the demand model, we have not seen a widespread effect on our stores. We have also observed an increase in the sales price of existing facilities as a result of the low interest rates, such that the capitalization rates on acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) have decreased from approximately 10% seven years ago to 7.25% today. With the decrease of debt and equity capital brought about by market conditions in the past year, we have seen capitalization rates level off at approximately 7.25%. Operating Trends In 2007, our industry experienced some softness in demand. This was due in part to regional issues, such as the reduction of hurricane driven demand in Florida and the Gulf Coast states, and to an overall slowdown in the housing sector. We believe this housing slowdown has impacted our industry in two ways: 1.) a reduction in lease up activity resulting from fewer residential real estate transactions (both buyers and sellers of residences use our product in times of transition) and 2.) a contraction of housing construction activity which has reduced the number of people working in the construction trades (trades people are a measurable part of our usual tenant base.) 19 Table of Contents While we enjoyed same store revenue growth of approximately 5% in each of the prior four years, we were only able to achieve 3% top line growth in 2007, primarily because of the aforementioned issues. We expect conditions in most of our markets to remain relatively stable at current levels and are forecasting 3% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2008. Expenses related to operating a self storage facility have increased substantially over the last five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). While we do not foresee further expansion of our cost base, we do expect the trend of increasing expenses to continue at a pace commensurate with CPI growth. Because almost all of our costs are fixed, should revenue growth moderate significantly or stall, operating margins will be affected. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow or significant declining revenue per storage facility. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 We recorded rental revenues of $187.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $26.6 million or 16.5% when compared to 2006 rental revenues of $160.9 million. Of the increase in rental revenue, $4.8 million resulted from a 3.2% increase in rental revenues at the 285 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2006). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units averaging 4.4%, offset by a decrease in occupancy of 175 basis points, which we believe resulted from general economic conditions, in particular the housing sector, and the return to normalcy in Florida after the hurricanes. As of April 1, 2006, the 20 Table of Contents consolidated income statement includes the results of a previously unconsolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran I, LLC) that has been consolidated as a result of an additional investment in that entity by us. The rental income related to Locke Sovran I that was included in our results for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.7 million higher than that included in 2006 as a result of the consolidation in April 2006. The remaining $20.1 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of 31 stores during 2007 and from having the 42 stores acquired in 2006 included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.9 million due to increased merchandise and insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $10.7 million, or 18.0%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Of this increase, $8.2 million were expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in 2007 and from having expenses from the 2006 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $1.9 million of the increase was due to increased property insurance, utilities, maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 285 core properties considered same stores. The property operating and real estate tax expense related to Locke Sovran I that was included in our results for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $0.6 million higher than that included in 2006 as a result of the consolidation in April 2006. We expect same store operating costs to increase only moderately in 2008 with increases primarily attributable to utilities and property taxes. General and administrative expenses increased $1.1 million or 8.1% from 2006 to 2007. The increase primarily resulted from the costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2007 and 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $34.0 million in 2007 from $25.3 million in 2006, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2007, a full year of depreciation on 2006 acquisitions, and the amortization of in place customers leases relating to these acquisitions. Income from operations increased from $67.6 million in 2006 to $74.5 million in 2007 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $29.5 million in 2006 to $33.9 million in 2007 as a result of higher interest rates, additional borrowings under our line of credit and term notes to purchase 31 stores in 2007, and the consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC as of April 1, 2006. The casualty gain recorded in 2007 relates to insurance proceeds received in excess of the carrying value of a building damaged by a fire at one of our facilities. The decrease in preferred stock dividends from 2006 to 2007 was a result of the conversion of all remaining 1,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock into 920,244 shares of common stock in July 2007. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 We recorded rental revenues of $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $27.1 million or 20.2% when compared to 2005 rental revenues of $133.9 million. As of April 1, 2006, the consolidated income statement includes the results of a previously unconsolidated joint venture (Locke Sovran I, LLC) that has been consolidated as a result of an additional investment in that entity by us. The rental income related to Locke Sovran I that was included in our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $5.1 million. Of the remaining $22.0 million increase in rental income, $6.6 million resulted from a 5.2% increase in rental revenues at the 255 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2005 that were at a stable occupancy). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units averaging 3.8%, and a slight occupancy increase, which we believe resulted from improved responsiveness to customer demand created by our centralized call center and the increased demand in areas damaged by the 2005 hurricanes. The remaining $15.4 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of 42 stores during 2006 and from having the 14 stores acquired in 2005 included for a full year of operations. Other income increased $0.9 million due to increased merchandise and insurance sales and the additional incidental revenue generated by truck rentals. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $10.9 million, or 22.6%, in 2006 compared to 21 Table of Contents 2005. Of this increase, $6.5 million were expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in 2006 and from having expenses from the 2005 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $2.6 million of the increase was due to increased property insurance, utilities, maintenance expenses, and increased property taxes at the 255 core properties considered same stores. The consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC as of April 1, 2006 resulted in a $1.8 million increase in property operating and real estate tax expense in 2006. We expect the trend of increasing operating costs to continue at a moderate to high pace primarily attributable to utilities and property insurance costs. General and administrative expenses increased $1.2 million or 9.6% from 2005 to 2006. The increase primarily resulted from the costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2006 and 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $25.3 million in 2006 from $21.2 million in 2005, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2006, a full year of depreciation on 2005 acquisitions, and the consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC. Income from operations increased from $55.9 million in 2005 to $67.6 million in 2006 as a result of the net effect of the aforementioned items. Interest expense increased from $20.2 million in 2005 to $29.5 million in 2006 as a result of higher interest rates, additional borrowings under our line of credit and term notes to purchase 42 stores in 2006, and the consolidation of Locke Sovran I, LLC as of April 1, 2006. The decrease in preferred stock dividends from 2005 to 2006 was a result of the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock into 920,244 shares of common stock in 2005. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations (FFO) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT) as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. 22 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 39,214 $ 36,610 $ 34,790 $ 32,004 $ 28,423 Minority interest in income 2,631 2,434 1,529 1,542 1,790 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 34,036 25,305 21,222 19,175 17,856 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 90 293 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 59 168 484 473 460 Casualty gain (114 ) Gain on sale of real estate (1,137 ) Preferred stock dividends (1,256 ) (2,512 ) (4,123 ) (7,168 ) (8,818 ) Redemption amount in excess of carrying value of Series B Preferred Stock (1,415 ) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Operating Partnership (1,425 ) (1,450 ) (1,519 ) (1,333 ) (1,563 ) Funds from operations allocable to minority interest in Locke Sovran I and Locke Sovran II (1,848 ) (1,785 ) (1,499 ) (1,475 ) (1,539 ) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $ 71,297 $ 58,770 $ 50,884 $ 40,756 $ 36,902 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through September 2008, at which time our revolving line of credit matures. We will be refinancing our $100 million unsecured line of credit and $40 million short term bank note in 2008. We expect these refinancings will be done through a new unsecured line of credit and the issuance of 10 year notes. Although we believe we can refinance at acceptable rates of interest, the recent turmoil in the credit markets may impact our overall financing costs. See Risk Factors We May Incur Problems with Our Real Estate Financing. Cash flows from operating activities were $85.1 million, $64.5 million and $60.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase for each year is primarily attributable to increased net income, increased non cash charges for depreciation and amortization, an increase in accounts payable related to property taxes, and a decrease in prepaid insurance. Cash used in investing activities was $190.3 million, $176.6 million, and $79.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. The increase in cash used from 2005 to 2006 was attributable to increased acquisition activity in 2006. The increase from 2006 to 2007 was due to increased acquisition activity, an increase in improvements to existing facilities, and additional investment in our consolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $61.5 million in 2007 compared to $154.9 million in 2006 and $20.7 million in 2005, respectively. In April 2006, the Company entered into a $150 million unsecured term note maturing in April 2016 bearing interest at 6.38%. The proceeds from this term note were used to pay down the 23 Table of Contents outstanding balance on the Companys line of credit, to repay a $25 million term note entered in January 2006 and a $15 million term note entered in April 2006, and to make an additional investment into Locke Sovran I, LLC and Locke Sovran II, LLC (consolidated joint ventures). In December 2006, we issued 2.3 million shares of our common stock and realized net proceeds of $122.4 million. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the entire outstanding balance on our line of credit that had been drawn on to finance acquisitions subsequent to April 2006. The remaining proceeds from the 2006 common stock offering were used along with 2007 borrowings under our line of credit to fund 2007 acquisitions. We have a $100 million unsecured line of credit that matures in September 2008 and a $100 million unsecured term note that matures in September 2009. The line of credit bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.90% and requires a 0.20% facility fee. The term note bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.20%. We also maintain a $80 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26% and a $20 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%. In September 2007, the Company entered into a $25 million term note arrangement with a bank maturing March 2008 bearing at LIBOR plus 1.20%. At December 31, 2007, there was no amount available on the revolving line of credit, and $19 million available under the bank term note. In January 2008, we increased the availability under the bank term note from $25 million to $40 million and extended the maturity date from March 31, 2008 to April 30, 2008. The line of credit facility and term notes currently have investment grade ratings from Standard and Poors (BBB ) and Fitch (BBB ). Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants. In addition to the unsecured financing mentioned above, our consolidated financial statements also include $110.5 million of mortgages payable as detailed below: * 7.80% mortgage note due December 2011, secured by 11 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran I) with an aggregate net book value of $41.6 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $29.1 million. * 7.19% mortgage note due March 2012, secured by 27 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran II) with an aggregate net book value of $80.2 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $43.6 million. * 7.25% mortgage note due December 2011, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $5.9 million, principal and interest paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 5.40%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $3.7 million. * 6.76% mortgage note due September 2013, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $2.1 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $1.0 million. * 6.35% mortgage note due March 2014, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $1.9 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $1.1 million. * 5.55% mortgage notes due November 2009, secured by 8 self storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of $35.3 million, interest only paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 6.44%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $25.7 million. * 7.50% mortgage notes due August 2011, secured by 3 self storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of $14.5 million, principal and interest paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 6.42%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007 on this mortgage was $6.3 million. The 7.80% and 7.19% mortgages were incurred in 2001 and 2002 respectively as part of the financing of the consolidated joint ventures. The Company assumed the 7.25%, 6.76%, 6.35%, 5.55% and 7.5% mortgage notes in connection with the acquisitions of storage facilities in 2005 and 2006. 24 Table of Contents In July 1999, we issued 1,200,000 shares of 9.85% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. We redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock on August 2, 2004 at a total cost of $30 million plus accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D 42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock, we recorded a reduction of $1.4 million from 2004 net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders relating to the difference between the Series B Preferred Stock carrying value and the redemption amount. On July 3, 2002, we entered into an agreement providing for the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 379,166 shares of common stock at $32.60 per share in a privately negotiated transaction. The offering price was $25.00 per share and the net proceeds of $67.9 million were used to reduce indebtedness that was incurred in the June 2002 acquisition of seven self storage properties and to repay a portion of our borrowings under the line of credit. During 2005, we issued 920,244 shares of our common stock in connection with a written notice from one of the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock requesting the conversion of 1,200,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. In 2004, we issued 306,748 shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. On July 7, 2007, we issued 920,244 shares of our common stock to the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock upon the holders election to convert the remaining 1,200,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. As a result of the conversion, $26.6 million recorded in shareholders equity as 8.375% Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock was reclassified to additional paid in capital. During 2007 and 2006, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2007, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. During 2007, we issued 265,916 shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plan. We realized $13.2 million from the sale of such shares. We expect to issue shares when our share price and capital needs warrant such issuance. Future acquisitions, share repurchases and repayment of the credit line are expected to be funded with draws on the bank term note, issuance of secured or unsecured term notes, issuance of common or preferred stock, sale of properties, private placement solicitation of joint venture equity and other sources of capital. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Contractual Payments due by period obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and thereafter Line of credit $ 100.0million $ 100.0million Term notes $ 356.0million $ 6.0million $ 100.0million $ $250.0million Mortgages payable $ 110.5million $ 1.8million $ 29.9million $ 76.9million $ 1.9million Interest payments $ 157.7million $ 34.3million $ 49.6million $ 38.3million $ 35.5million Land lease $ 1.2million $ 0.1million $ 0.1million $ 0.1million $ 0.9million Building leases $ 4.5million $ 0.6million $ 0.8million $ 0.1million $ 3.0million Total $ 729.9million $ 142.8million $ 180.4million $ 115.4million $ 291.3million ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2007, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, borrowings under the bank term note, proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and proceeds from the December 2006 common stock offering to acquire 31 Properties in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, New York, and 25 Table of Contents Texas comprising 2.3 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2006, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, borrowings under the $150 million 10 year term note, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire 42 Properties in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee, and Texas comprising 2.6 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2005, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire 14 Properties in Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas comprising one million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. At December 31, 2007, we owned and operated 358 self storage facilities in 22 states. Of these facilities, 38 are managed by us for two consolidated joint ventures of which we are a majority owner. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand into new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. At December 31, 2007, we were in negotiations to acquire ten stores for approximately $52 million. Two of these stores were purchased in January of 2008 for $14.3 million. There can be no assurance that the remaining potential acquisitions will be completed. In addition, we are continuing with our program of expanding and enhancing our existing properties. In 2008, we expect to add as much as 700,000 square feet of climate and or humidity controlled space, and acquire several parcels of land contiguous to our existing stores. The projected cost of these revenue enhancing improvements is estimated at approximately $50 million. During 2007 we spent approximately $25 million on such revenue enhancing improvements. Funding of these and the above mentioned improvements is expected to be provided primarily from borrowings under our line of credit, and issuance of common shares through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We also expect to accelerate, by two to three years, the required capital expenditures on 50 to 70 of our Properties. This includes repainting, paving, and remodeling of the office buildings at these facilities. For 2007 we spent approximately $21 million on such improvements and we expect to spend approximately $20 million in 2008. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2004, as part of an asset management program, we sold five non strategic storage facilities located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio, and South Carolina to unaffiliated parties for $11.7 million resulting in a net gain of $1.1 million. No sales took place in 2005 through 2007. We may seek to sell additional Properties to joint venture programs or third parties in 2008. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our off balance sheet arrangement includes an ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses our headquarters and other tenants. The Company has a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC at December 31, 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs income was $80,000 and $80,000, respectively. The Company paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $561,000, $583,000 and $445,000 in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under the lease are $0.6 million per year through 2010. Also, the Company purchased land from Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for $0.4 million and $1.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In April 2006, the Company made an additional investment of $2.8 million in a former off balance sheet arrangement known as Locke Sovran I, LLC that increased the Companys ownership to over 70%. As a result of this transaction the Company has consolidated the results of operations of Locke Sovran I, LLC in its financial 26 Table of Contents statements since April 1, 2006, the date that it acquired its controlling interest. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Companys share of Locke Sovran I, LLCs income was $171,000 and $141,000, respectively, and the amortization of the deferred gain was $40,000, each of which are recorded as equity in income of joint ventures on the consolidated statements of operations for those years. The Company manages the storage facilities for Locke Sovran I, LLC and received fees of $332,000, and $322,000 for the years ended 2005, and 2004. Locke Sovran I, LLC, owns 11 self storage facilities throughout the United States. A summary of the unconsolidated joint ventures financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows: Iskalo Office (dollars in thousands) Holdings, LLC Balance Sheet Data: Investment in office building $ 5,662 Other assets 808 Total Assets $ 6,470 Mortgage payable $ 7,410 Other liabilities 110 Total Liabilities 7,520 Unaffiliated partners deficiency (610) Company deficiency (440) Total Liabilities and Partners Deficiency $ 6,470 Income Statement Data: Total revenues $ 1,387 Total expenses 1,224 Net income $ 163 We do not expect to have material future cash outlays relating to this joint venture and we do not guarantee the debt of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. A summary of our cash flows arising from the off balance sheet arrangements with Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for the three years ended December 31, 2007, and with Locke Sovran I, LLC for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the three months ended March 31, 2006 (the date it has been included in our consolidated results of operations) are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Statement of Operations Other income (management fees income) $ $ 85 $ 332 General and administrative expenses (corporate office rent) 561 583 445 Equity in income of joint ventures 119 172 202 Investing activities Reimbursement of advances to (advances to) joint ventures 17 (187 ) Financing activities Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 98 123 490 27 Table of Contents REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2008 may be applied toward our 2007 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2007, our percentage of revenue from such sources exceeded 98%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. INTEREST RATE RISK We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt. At December 31, 2007, we have three outstanding interest rate swap agreements as summarized below: Fixed Floating Rate Notional Amount Effective Date Expiration Date Rate Paid Received $50 Million 11/14/05 9/1/09 5.590 % 1 month LIBOR $20 Million 9/4/05 9/4/13 5.935 % 6 month LIBOR $50 Million 10/10/06 9/1/09 5.680 % 1 month LIBOR Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $120 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through September 2009, $350 million of our $456 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding unsecured debt of $456 million at December 31, 2007, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense $1.1 million annually. 28 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2007. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.

Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because we increase rental rates on most of our storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 29 Table of Contents The cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 48, if any, is reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Companys adoption date was January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, FASB Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) was issued. SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by providing a standard definition of fair value as it applies to assets and liabilities. SFAS 157, which does not require any new fair value measurements, clarifies the application of other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The effective date for the Company is January 1, 2008. However, the FASB has delayed the effective date of Statement 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows entities to voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The effective date for the Company is January 1, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS 159 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160), which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries not held by the parent to be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. This statement also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. This Statement applies prospectively to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements and applies prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Upon adoption of SFAS 160, the Company will re classify non controlling interests as a component of equity. In December 2007, the FASB Statement 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) was issued. SFAS 141R replaces SFAS 141. SFAS 141R requires the acquirer of a business to recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value. SFAS 141R also requires transactions costs related to the business combination to be expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2009. We have not yet determined the impact of SFAS 141R related to future acquisitions, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
