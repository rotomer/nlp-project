Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words intends, believes, expects, anticipates, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Companys ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Companys existing business and operations; the Companys ability to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Companys existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Companys outstanding floating rate debt; the Companys ability to comply with debt covenants; any future ratings on the Companys debt instruments; the regional concentration of the Companys business may subject it to economic downturns in the states of Florida and Texas; the Companys reliance on its call center; the Companys cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We believe we are the fourth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned and managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly name Uncle Bobs Self Storage. Operating Strategy Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: We seek to differentiate our self storage facilities from our competition through innovative marketing and value added product offerings including: Our Customer Care Center, which answers sales inquiries and makes reservations for all of our Properties on a centralized basis, The Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 258 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers in moving into their spaces, Our dehumidification system, known as Dri guard, which provides our customers with a better environment to store their goods and improves yields on our Properties, and Internet marketing and sales. Our Name your Price concession differentiates us from the free month offer now prevalent in our industry, and allows us to engage the customer in a unique manner. We are able to customize this offer based on occupancies and demand. Our customized property management systems enable us to improve our ability to track trends, set optimal pricing levels, enjoy considerable economies of scale in vendor and supply pricing, and control collections and accounts receivable. 19 Table of Contents In addition, our managers are better qualified and receive a significantly higher level of training than they did in the past, customer access and security are greatly enhanced as a result of advances in technology, and property appearance and functionality have been improved. B. Acquiring additional stores: Our objective is to acquire new stores one or two at a time in markets we currently operate in. By so doing, we can add to our existing base, which should improve market penetration in those areas, and contribute to the benefits achieved from economies of scale. We may also enter new markets if we can do so by acquiring a group of stores in those markets. We feel that our marketing efforts and control systems would enhance even those portfolios that have been managed efficiently by independent operators, and that attractive returns can be generated by such acquisitions. C. Expanding our management business: We see our management business as a source of future acquisitions. We may develop additional joint ventures in which we are minority owners and managers of the self storage facilities acquired by these joint ventures. The joint venture agreements will give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed properties in the event they are offered for sale. D. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: Over the past five years, we have undertaken a program of expanding and enhancing our Properties. In 2007, we expended approximately $25 million to add some 444,000 square feet of premium space (i.e., air conditioned and or humidity controlled) to our Properties; in 2008, we spent approximately $26 million to add 403,000 square feet and to convert 95,000 square feet to premium storage; and in 2009, we completed construction of a new 78,000 square foot facility in Richmond Virginia, added 175,000 square feet to other existing Properties, and converted 64,000 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $18 million. Supply and Demand We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. The current economic conditions and the credit market environment have resulted in a decrease in new supply on a national basis in 2008 and 2009. With the decrease of debt and equity capital brought about by the credit market tightening in the past year, we have seen capitalization rates on acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) increase to approximately 8.0% and expect continued increases in 2010. From 2003 to 2007, the historically low interest rates available to developers resulted in increased supply on a national basis. We experienced some of this excess supply in certain markets in Texas and Florida from 2003 to 2007, but because of the demand model, we did not see a widespread effect on our stores in those years. In 2008, the Florida market was negatively affected by the current economic downturn and in 2009 many markets were affected as consumers pulled back spending. Operating Trends Since 2007, our industry has experienced some softness in demand. This was due to the economic slowdown that began in late 2007, and in part to regional issues, such as the reduction of hurricane driven demand in Florida and the Gulf Coast states, and to an overall slowdown in the housing sector. We believe the housing slowdown has impacted our industry in two ways: 1.) a reduction in lease up activity resulting from fewer residential real estate transactions (both buyers and sellers of residences use our product in times of transition) and 2.) a contraction of housing construction activity which has reduced the number of people working in the construction trades (trades people are a measurable part of our usual customer base.) 20 Table of Contents While we enjoyed same store revenue growth from 2003 through 2008, in 2009 our same store revenue decreased 3.1%, primarily because of the aforementioned issues. We expect conditions in most of our markets to remain challenging and are forecasting 2% to 0% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2010. We were able to reduce many expenses at the store operating level in 2009 to mitigate the effect of the revenue decline. Expenses related to operating a self storage facility had increased substantially over the previous five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). While we do not expect further expense decreases in 2010, we do believe expense increases will be at a manageable level of between 2% and 4%. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow, significant declining revenue per storage facility, or an exception that, more likely than not, a property will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows could change based upon changes in market conditions, expected occupancy rates, etc. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets to determine if any changes are warranted based upon various factors, including changes in the planned usage of the assets, customer demand, etc. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have not made significant changes to the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets in the past and we dont have any current expectation of making significant changes in 2010. Consolidation and investment in joint ventures: We consolidate all wholly owned subsidiaries. Partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures are consolidated when we control the entity. Investments in joint ventures that we do not control but for which we have significant influence over are reported using the equity method. Under the equity method, our investment in joint ventures are stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Revenue and Expense Recognition: Rental income is recognized when earned pursuant to month to month leases for storage space. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period, which is generally during the first month of occupancy. Rental income received prior to the start of the rental period is included in deferred revenue. 21 Table of Contents Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance under ASC Topic 810, Consolidation by issuing SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167). The revised guidance amends previous guidance (as previously required under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Variable Interest Entities) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. Under the revised guidance, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The revised guidance also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The revised guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities. The revised guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the revised guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 We recorded rental revenues of $186.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5.6 million or 2.9% when compared to 2008 rental revenues of $192.5 million. Of the decrease in rental revenue, $6.2 million resulted from a 3.2% decrease in rental revenues at the 352 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2008). The decrease in same store rental revenues was a result of a 2.1% decrease in average rental income per square foot as a result of increased move in incentives used in 2009 to attract customers. We also experienced a decrease in square foot occupancy of 115 basis points, which we believe resulted from general economic conditions, in particular the housing sector. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in rental revenues resulting from having the three stores acquired in 2008 included for a full year of operations. Other income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance commissions, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased in 2009 primarily as a result of $0.3 million increase in commissions earned from our customer insurance program. Property operating and real estate tax expense decreased $2.0 million, or 2.7%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Much of the decrease resulted from numerous expense control initiatives and from a reduction in yellow page advertising at the 352 core properties considered same stores. These expense decreases were partially offset by a 4.1% increase in same store property tax expense and $0.3 million of additional expenses incurred from having the 2008 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. We expect same store operating costs to increase only moderately in 2010 with increases primarily attributable to utilities and property taxes. General and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million or 7.9% from 2008 to 2009. The increase primarily resulted from the write off of construction in progress projects that were terminated and an increase in internet advertising. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $33.4 million in 2009 from $33.9 million in 2008, primarily as a result of a $1.0 million decrease in amortization of in place customers leases relating to previous year acquisitions, offset partially by a full year of depreciation on those acquisitions. 22 Table of Contents Interest expense increased from $38.1 million in 2008 to $50.1 million in 2009 as a result of the following factors: A credit ratings downgrade by Fitch Ratings in May 2009 on our unsecured floating rate notes triggered a 1.75% increase in the interest rate on our $150 million term notes and a 0.375% increase in the interest rate on our $250 million term notes. The increase was effective from May to October of 2009, at which time our credit rating was upgraded back to investment grade rating after our common stock offering in October 2009; At March 31, 2009, the Company had violated the leverage ratio covenant contained in the line of credit and term note agreements. In May 2009, the Company obtained a waiver of the violation as of March 31, 2009. The fees paid to obtain the waiver were approximately $0.9 million and are included in 2009 interest expense and; On October 5, 2009, the Company used proceeds from the issuance of common stock to terminate the interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $75 million and $25 million (see Note 9 of our financial statements). The total cost to terminate the swaps was $8.4 million and is included as additional interest expense in 2009 and; In October 2009, we wrote off to interest expense $0.6 million of unamortized financing fees related to the $100 million term note that was repaid with the proceeds of the common stock offering. The casualty loss recorded in 2009 relates to insurance proceeds received that were less than the carrying value of a building damaged by a fire at one of our facilities. During 2009, we sold a parcel of land to the State of Georgia Department of Transportation for their use as part of a road widening project for net cash proceeds of $1.1 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.1 million. As described in Note 5 to the financial statements, during 2009 the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. During 2008 the Company sold one non strategic storage facility for net cash proceeds of $7.0 million resulting in a gain of $0.7 million. The 2009, 2008, and 2007 operations of these facilities and the loss/gain associated with the disposal are reported in income from discontinued operations for all periods presented. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 We recorded rental revenues of $192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $8.7 million or 4.7% when compared to 2007 rental revenues of $183.8 million. Of the increase in rental revenue, $1.3 million resulted from a 0.7% increase in rental revenues at the 321 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2007). The increase in same store rental revenues was achieved primarily through rate increases on select units averaging 1.9%, offset by a decrease in square foot occupancy of 150 basis points, which we believe resulted from general economic conditions, in particular the housing sector. The remaining $7.4 million increase in rental revenues resulted from the acquisition of three stores during 2008 and from having the 31 stores acquired in 2007 included for a full year of operations. Other income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance commissions, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased in 2008 primarily as a result of $1.1 million of management and acquisition fees generated from our unconsolidated joint venture, Sovran HHF Storage Holdings LLC. Property operating and real estate tax expense increased $5.0 million, or 7.3%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Of this increase, $2.7 million were expenses incurred by the facilities acquired in 2008 and from having expenses from the 2007 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. $2.3 million of the increase was due to increased payroll, property taxes, utilities, and maintenance expenses at the 321 core properties considered same stores. General and administrative expenses increased $2.0 million or 13.4% from 2007 to 2008. The increase primarily resulted from the costs associated with operating the properties acquired in 2008 and 2007, and from managing the 25 properties acquired by our joint venture in 2008. 23 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $33.9 million in 2008 from $33.4 million in 2007, primarily as a result of additional depreciation taken on real estate assets acquired in 2008, and a full year of depreciation on 2007 acquisitions, offset by a decrease in amortization of in place customers leases relating to these acquisitions. Interest expense increased from $33.9 million in 2007 to $38.1 million in 2008 as a result of additional borrowings under our line of credit and term notes to purchase three stores in 2008, as well as an increase in interest rates as a result of our debt refinancing in June 2008. As described in Note 5 to the financial statements, during 2009, the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. In 2008, the Company sold one non strategic storage facility located in Michigan for net cash proceeds of $7.0 million resulting in a gain of $0.7 million. The 2008 and 2007 operations of these facilities are reported as discontinued operations. The decrease in preferred stock dividends from 2007 to 2008 was a result of the conversion of all remaining 1,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock into 920,244 shares of common stock in July 2007. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations (FFO) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT) as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. 24 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 19,916 $ 37,399 $ 37,958 $ 34,098 $ 30,667 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,738 2,284 2,631 2,434 1,529 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 33,385 33,876 33,360 24,653 20,604 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 434 591 676 652 618 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 820 333 59 168 484 Casualty gain (114 ) Loss (gain) on sale of real estate 509 (716 ) Funds from operations allocable to noncontrolling interest in Operating Partnership (984 ) (1,366 ) (1,425 ) (1,450 ) (1,519 ) Funds from operations allocable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures (1,360 ) (1,564 ) (1,848 ) (1,785 ) (1,499 ) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $ 54,458 $ 70,837 $ 71,297 $ 58,770 $ 50,884 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The most sensitive covenant is the leverage ratio covenant contained in our line of credit and term note agreements. This covenant limits our total consolidated liabilities to 55% of our gross asset value. At December 31, 2009, our leverage ratio as defined in the agreements was approximately 42.8%. The agreements define total consolidated liabilities to include the liabilities of the Company plus our share of liabilities of unconsolidated joint ventures. The agreements also define a prescribed formula for determining gross asset value which incorporates the use of a 9.25% capitalization rate applied to annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as defined in the agreements. At March 31, 2009, the Company had violated the leverage ratio covenant contained in the line of credit and term note agreements. In May 2009, the Company obtained a waiver of the violation as of March 31, 2009. The fees paid to obtain the waiver were approximately $0.9 million and are included in interest expense in 2009. In the event that the Company violates debt covenants in the future, the amounts due under the agreements could be callable by the lenders. On May 6, 2009, we announced a reduction in our quarterly dividend for the remainder of 2009 from $0.64 per share to $0.45 per share. In addition to the reduction in the dividend, in the second quarter of 2009 we changed our policy of declaring the dividend from the last week in the quarter to the first week following the quarter end. As a result of this date change, no dividend was declared in the three months ended June 30, 2009. A dividend of $0.45 per common share was declared on January 4, 2010 and paid on January 26, 2010. The dividend paid amounted to $12.4 million. In 2010, we expect to declare and pay four dividends in the calendar year. On October 5, 2009, the Company completed the public offering of 4,025,000 shares of its common stock at $29.75 per share. Net proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses were approximately $114.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay $100 million of the Companys unsecured term note due June 2012 and to terminate two interest rate swaps relating to the debt repaid at a cost of $8.4 million. The Company used the remaining proceeds along with operating cash flows to payoff a maturing mortgage in December 2009 of $26.1 million. 25 Table of Contents We believe that the steps the Company has taken, including but not limited to the equity raised from our common stock offering of approximately $114.0 million, the pay down of $100 million of our term notes, and the reduction in the quarterly dividend, will be adequate to avoid future covenant violations under the current terms of our line of credit and term note agreements. Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities and our availability on our line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through June 2011, at which time our revolving line of credit matures. Future draws on our line of credit may be limited due to covenant restrictions. Cash flows from operating activities were $59.1 million, $77.1 million and $85.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in net income. The decrease in net income was primarily a result of lower rental income and increased interest expense. The decrease in operating cash from 2007 to 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income and accounts payable remaining consistent with the prior year. Cash used in investing activities was $4.4 million, $82.7 million, and $190.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively. The decrease in cash used from 2008 to 2009 was due to (i) reduced acquisition and capital improvement activity in 2009, (ii) an increase in proceeds from the sale of storage facilities, and (iii) a reduction in the funding of our share of the joint venture entered into in 2008. The decrease in cash used from 2007 to 2008 was attributable to reduced acquisition activity in 2008 as many of the properties acquired were acquired through a joint venture of which we are a 20% owner. Cash used in financing activities was $48.5 million in 2009, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $6.0 million in 2008 and $61.4 million in 2007. In 2009, we used our operating cash flow and the proceeds from our common stock offering to paydown $14.0 million of our line of credit, $100 million of term notes, and a $26.1 million mortgage. Our reduced acquisition activity in 2008 was the driver behind the decrease in cash provided from financing activities from 2007 to 2008. On June 25, 2008, we entered into agreements relating to new unsecured credit arrangements, and received funds under those arrangements. As part of the agreements, the Company entered into a $250 million unsecured term note maturing in June 2012 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.625% (based on the Companys December 31, 2009 credit rating). The proceeds from this term note were used to repay the Companys previous line of credit that was to mature in September 2008, the Companys term note that was to mature in September 2009, the term note maturing in July 2008, and to provide for working capital. We repaid $100 million of this term note with the proceeds of our common stock offering. The agreements also provide for a $125 million (expandable to $175 million) revolving line of credit maturing June 2011 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375% (based on the Companys credit rating at December 31, 2009), and requires a 0.25% facility fee. The interest rate at December 31, 2009 on the Companys available line of credit was approximately 1.61% (1.8% at December 31, 2008). At December 31, 2009, there was $125 million available on the unsecured line of credit. We believe that if operating results remain consistent with historical levels and levels of other debt and liabilities remain consistent with amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009, the entire $125 million line of credit could be drawn without violating our debt covenants. We also maintain a $80 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26%, a $20 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%, and a $150 million unsecured term note maturing in April 2016 bearing interest at 6.38% (based on our December 31, 2009 credit ratings). Prior to our October 2009 common stock offering, the line of credit facility and term notes had an investment grade rating from Standard and Poors (BBB ). Due to our debt covenant violation and operating trends, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Companys rating on its revolving credit facility and term notes to non investment 26 Table of Contents grade (BB) in May 2009. As a result of our common stock offering in October 2009 and the use of proceeds to repay $100 million of term notes, Fitch Ratings upgraded our rating on our line of credit and term notes again to investment grade (BBB ). Combined, this credit rating upgrade, the repayment of $100 million of term notes and the termination of the interest rate swaps related to these term notes are expected to reduce our annualized interest by approximately $9.8 million. In addition to the unsecured financing mentioned above, our consolidated financial statements also include $81.2 million of mortgages payable as detailed below: * 7.80% mortgage note due December 2011, secured by 11 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran I) with an aggregate net book value of $42.7 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2009 on this mortgage was $28.4 million. * 7.19% mortgage note due March 2012, secured by 27 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran II) with an aggregate net book value of $80.3 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2009 on this mortgage was $41.5 million. * 7.25% mortgage note due December 2011, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $5.7 million, principal and interest paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 5.40%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2008 on this mortgage was $3.4 million. * 6.76% mortgage note due September 2013, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $2.0 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2009 on this mortgage was $1.0 million. * 6.35% mortgage note due March 2014, secured by 1 self storage facility with an aggregate net book value of $3.7 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2009 on this mortgage was $1.1 million. * 7.50% mortgage notes due August 2011, secured by 3 self storage facilities with an aggregate net book value of $14.0 million, principal and interest paid monthly. Estimated market rate at time of acquisition 6.42%. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2009 on this mortgage was $5.9 million. The 7.80% and 7.19% mortgages were incurred in 2001 and 2002 respectively as part of the financing of the consolidated joint ventures. The Company assumed the 7.25%, 6.76%, 6.35%, and 7.50% mortgage notes in connection with the acquisitions of storage facilities in 2005 and 2006. During 2009, we issued approximately 1.4 million shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plan. We received $32.6 million from the sale of such shares. Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan was suspended in November 2009. We plan to reinstate our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan in 2010 and expect to issue shares when our share price and capital needs warrant such issuance. During 2009 and 2008, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2009, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. Future acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program, and share repurchases are expected to be funded with draws on our line of credit, sale of properties and private placement solicitation of joint venture equity. Current capital market conditions may prevent us from accessing other traditional sources of capital including the issuance of common and preferred stock and the issuance of unsecured term notes. Should these capital market conditions persist, we may have to curtail acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program, and share repurchases as we approach June 2011, when our line of credit matures. 27 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and thereafter Line of credit Term notes $ 400.0 million $ 150.0 million $ 100.0 million $ 150.0 million Mortgages payable $ 81.2 million $ 2.2 million $ 77.1 million $ 1.9 million Interest payments $ 99.2 million $ 23.8 million $ 40.6 million $ 22.9 million $ 11.9 million Interest rate swap payments $ 11.5 million $ 7.0 million $ 4.2 million $ 0.3 million Land lease $ 1.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.8 million Building leases $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million Total $ 593.1 million $ 33.2 million $ 272.0 million $ 125.2 million $ 162.7 million Interest payments include actual interest on fixed rate debt and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on December 31, 2009 rates. Interest rate swap payments include net settlements of swap liabilities based on forecasted variable rates. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES We acquired no properties in 2009. During 2008, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, borrowings under the bank term note, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire three Properties in Mississippi and Ohio comprising 0.2 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. During 2007, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to the line of credit, borrowings under the bank term note, proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and proceeds from the December 2006 common stock offering to acquire 31 Properties in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, New York, and Texas comprising 2.3 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand in new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. No properties were acquired in 2009 and acquisitions in 2010 may be limited due to the fact that, at present, sellers asking prices remain considerably higher than the Company believes market conditions warrant. In 2009 we scaled back a planned $550 million program to expand and enhance our existing properties. Instead we spent approximately $18 million to add 175,000 square feet to existing Properties, and to convert 64,000 square feet to premium storage. We also completed construction of a new 78,000 square foot facility in Richmond, Virginia. Although we do not expect to construct any new facilities in 2010, we do plan to expend up to $20 million to expand and enhance existing facilities. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2009, we sold five non strategic storage facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. During 2008, we sold one non strategic storage facility located in Michigan for net cash proceeds of $7.0 million resulting in a gain of $0.7 million. No sales took place in 2007. We may seek to sell additional Properties to third parties or joint venture programs in 2010. 28 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have a 20% ownership interest in Sovran HHF Storage Holdings LLC (Sovran HHF), a joint venture that was formed in May 2008 to acquire self storage properties that are managed by us. The carrying value of our investment at December 31, 2009 was $19.9 million. Twenty five properties were acquired by Sovran HHF as of December 31, 2008 for approximately $171.5 million. We contributed $18.6 million to the joint venture as our share of capital required to fund the acquisitions. As manager of Sovran HHF, we earn a management and call center fee of 7% of gross revenues which totaled $1.2 million and $0.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also received an acquisition fee of 0.5% or $0.7 million of purchase price for securing purchases for the joint venture in 2008. Our share of Sovran HHFs income for 2009 and 2008 was $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, Sovran HHF owed us $0.2 million for payments made by us on behalf of the joint venture. We also have a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses the Companys headquarters and other tenants. Our investment includes a capital contribution of $49. The carrying value of our investment is a liability of $0.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs income (loss) was $7,000, ($6,000), and $80,000, respectively. We paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $608,000, $600,000 and $561,000 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under the lease are $0.6 million per year through 2010.

A summary of our cash flows arising from the off balance sheet arrangements with Sovran 29 Table of Contents HHF and Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for the three years ended December 31, 2009 are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Statement of Operations Other operating income (management fees and acquisition fee income) $ 1,243 $ 1,135 $ General and administrative expenses (corporate office rent) 608 600 561 Equity in income of joint ventures 235 104 119 Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 686 345 98 Investing activities Investment in joint ventures (331 ) (20,287 ) Reimbursement of advances to (advances to) joint ventures 163 (336 ) REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2010 may be applied toward our 2009 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2009, our percentage of revenue from such sources was approximately 98%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. INTEREST RATE RISK We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2009, we have three outstanding interest rate swap agreements as summarized below: Fixed Floating Rate Notional Amount Effective Date Expiration Date Rate Paid Received $20 Million 9/4/05 9/4/13 4.4350 % 6 month LIBOR $50 Million 7/1/08 6/25/12 4.2825 % 1 month LIBOR $100 Million 7/1/08 6/22/12 4.2965 % 1 month LIBOR Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $170 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through June 2012, all of our $400 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding unsecured debt of $400 million at December 31, 2009, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have no effect on our interest expense. The table below summarizes our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2009. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial 30 Table of Contents instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.

Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because we increase rental rates on most of our storage units at the beginning of May and because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. Item 7A.
