Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words intends, believes, expects, anticipates, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Companys ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Companys existing business and operations; the Companys ability to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Companys existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Companys outstanding floating rate debt; the Companys ability to comply with debt covenants; any future ratings on the Companys debt instruments; the regional concentration of the Companys business may subject it to economic downturns in the states of Florida and Texas; the Companys reliance on its call center; the Companys cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We believe we are the fifth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned and managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly name Uncle Bobs Self Storage. Operating Strategy Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: We seek to differentiate our self storage facilities from our competition through innovative marketing and value added product offerings including: Our Customer Care Center, which for the last 10 years has answered sales inquiries and made reservations for all of our Properties on a centralized basis, The Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 257 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers moving into their spaces, Our dehumidification system, known as Dri guard, which provides our customers with a better environment to store their goods and improves yields on our Properties, and Internet marketing and sales. Our Name your Price concession differentiates us from the free month offer now prevalent in our industry, and allows us to engage the customer in a unique manner. We are able to customize this offer based on occupancies and demand. Our customized property management systems enable us to track trends, set optimal pricing levels, enjoy considerable economies of scale in vendor and supply pricing, and control collections and accounts receivable. 21 Table of Contents In addition, our managers are better qualified and receive a significantly higher level of training than they did in the past, customer access and security are greatly enhanced as a result of advances in technology, and property appearance and functionality have been improved. B. Acquiring additional stores: Our objective is to acquire new stores one or two at a time in markets we currently operate in. By so doing, we can add to our existing base, which should improve market penetration in those areas, and contribute to the benefits achieved from economies of scale. We may also enter new markets if we can do so by acquiring a group of stores in those markets. We feel that our marketing efforts and control systems can enhance even those portfolios that have been managed efficiently by independent operators, and that attractive returns can be generated by such acquisitions. C. Expanding our management business: We see our management business as a source of future acquisitions. We may develop additional joint ventures in which we are minority owners and managers of the self storage facilities acquired by these joint ventures. The joint venture agreements will give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed properties in the event they are offered for sale. D. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: Over the past five years, we have undertaken a program of expanding and enhancing our Properties. In 2007, we expended approximately $25 million to add some 444,000 square feet of premium space (i.e., air conditioned and or humidity controlled) to our Properties; in 2008, we spent approximately $26 million to add 403,000 square feet and to convert 95,000 square feet to premium storage; in 2009, we completed construction of a new 78,000 square foot facility in Richmond Virginia, added 175,000 square feet to other existing Properties, and converted 64,000 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $18 million; and in 2010, we added 162,000 square feet to existing Properties, and converted 6,500 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $9 million. Supply and Demand / Operating Trends We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. The recent economic conditions and the credit market environment have resulted in a decrease in new supply on a national basis in the last three years. With the recent loosening of the debt and equity markets, we have seen capitalization rates on quality acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) decrease from approximately 8% to 7.25%. Since 2007, our industry has experienced some softness in demand. This was due to the economic slowdown that began in late 2007, and in part to regional issues, such as the reduction of hurricane driven demand in Florida and the Gulf Coast states, and to an overall slowdown in the housing sector. We believe the housing slowdown has impacted our industry in two ways: 1.) a reduction in lease up activity resulting from fewer residential real estate transactions (both buyers and sellers of residences use our product in times of transition) and 2.) a contraction of housing construction activity which has reduced the number of people working in the construction trades (trades people are a measurable part of our usual customer base.) Although same store customer move ins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009, move outs were also lower by a higher amount, leaving a slight net increase in customers for 2010. In 2010, we returned to positive same store revenue growth after experiencing a 3.1% decline in same store 22 Table of Contents revenue in 2009. From 2003 through 2008 we had experienced positive same store sales growth. We expect conditions in most of our markets to continue the slow recovery that we saw in 2010 and are forecasting 2% to 4% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2011. We were able to reduce many expenses at the store operating level in 2009 and 2010 to mitigate the effect of the revenue challenges. Expenses related to operating a self storage facility had increased substantially over the previous five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). While we do not expect further expense decreases in 2011, we do believe expense increases will be at a manageable level of between 2% and 4%. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow, significant declining revenue per storage facility, or an expectation that, more likely than not, a property will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows could change based upon changes in market conditions, expected occupancy rates, etc. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, no assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy. Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets to determine if any changes are warranted based upon various factors, including changes in the planned usage of the assets, customer demand, etc. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have not made significant changes to the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets in the past and we dont have any current expectation of making significant changes in 2011. Consolidation and investment in joint ventures: We consolidate all wholly owned subsidiaries. Partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures are consolidated when we control the entity. Investments in joint ventures that we do not control but for which we have significant influence over are reported using the equity method. Under the equity method, our investment in joint ventures are stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Revenue and Expense Recognition: Rental income is recognized when earned pursuant to month to month leases for storage space. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period, which is generally during the first month of occupancy. Rental income received prior to the start of the rental period is included in deferred revenue. 23 Table of Contents Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance under ASC Topic 810, Consolidation by issuing SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167). The revised guidance amends previous guidance (as previously required under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), "Variable Interest Entities) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. Under the revised guidance, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The revised guidance also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The revised guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities. The revised guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, with early adoption prohibited. The adoption of this revised guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2010 06 to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (including the reasons for these transfers) and the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3. This update also requires a reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. In addition to these new disclosure requirements, this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements. For example, this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities. This update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. This update became effective for the Company January 1, 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2011. The Company will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. Other than requiring additional disclosures in Note 9, the adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 We recorded rental revenues of $182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $0.2 million or 0.1% when compared to 2009 rental revenues of $183.1 million. Of the decrease in rental revenue, $0.4 million resulted from a 0.2% decrease in rental revenues at the 344 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2009). The decrease in same store rental revenues was a result of a small decrease in average rental income per square foot as a result of our continued use of move in incentives to attract customers. Average occupancy in 2010 was essentially flat to 2009. The decrease in same store rental income was offset by a $0.2 million increase in rental revenues resulting from the continued lease up of our Richmond Virginia property constructed in 2009 and the few days of revenues from the acquisition of seven properties completed in late December 2010. Other income, which includes merchandise sales, 24 Table of Contents insurance commissions, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased in 2010 primarily as a result of $1.0 million increase in commissions earned from our customer insurance program. Property operating expenses increased $1.1 million or 2.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase resulted mostly from higher health insurance costs and repairs and maintenance expense, as other property expenses were kept at or below 2009 levels. Property tax expense decreased $0.3 million as a result of assessment reductions and municipalities holding property tax rates steady. We expect same store operating costs to increase moderately in 2011 with increases primarily attributable to employee costs, utilities, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million or 17.2% from 2009 to 2010. The key drivers of the increase were a $1.3 million increase in salaries and performance incentives, $0.8 million in property acquisition expenses in 2010 versus no acquisitions in 2009, $0.5 million increase in health insurance costs, $0.4 million increase in internet advertising, and a $0.2 increase in tax expense related to our taxable REIT subsidiary. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.9 million in 2010 from $32.7 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a full year of depreciation on the Virginia property constructed in 2009, and the depreciation on the expansions completed at existing stores. Interest expense decreased from $50.1 million in 2009 to $31.7 million in 2010 as a result of the following factors: Our credit rating remained investment grade during all of 2010. In May 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our rating on our unsecured floating rate notes which triggered a temporary 1.75% increase in the interest rate on our $150 million term notes and a 0.375% increase in the interest rate on our $250 million term notes. The increase was effective from May to October of 2009, at which time our credit rating was upgraded back to investment grade rating after our common stock offering in October 2009; At March 31, 2009, the Company had violated the leverage ratio covenant contained in the line of credit and term note agreements. In May 2009, the Company obtained a waiver of the violation as of March 31, 2009. The fees paid to obtain the waiver were approximately $0.9 million and are included in 2009 interest expense. No such violations occurred in 2010; On October 5, 2009, the Company used proceeds from the issuance of common stock to terminate the interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $75 million and $25 million (see Note 8 of our financial statements). The total cost to terminate the swaps was $8.4 million and is included as additional interest expense in 2009. No such termination occurred in 2010, and; In October 2009, we wrote off to interest expense $0.6 million of unamortized financing fees related to the $100 million term note that was repaid with the proceeds of the common stock offering. No financing fees were written off in 2010. The casualty loss recorded in 2009 relates to insurance proceeds received that were less than the carrying value of a building damaged by a fire at one of our facilities. During 2009, we sold a parcel of land to the State of Georgia Department of Transportation for their use as part of a road widening project for net cash proceeds of $1.1 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.1 million. As described in Note 5 to the financial statements, during 2010 the Company sold ten non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $23.7 million resulting in a gain of $6.9 million. During 2009 the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. During 2008 the Company sold one non strategic storage facility for net cash proceeds of $7.0 million resulting in a gain of $0.7 million. The 2010, 2009, and 2008 operations of these facilities and the loss/gain associated with the disposal are reported in income from discontinued operations for all periods presented. 25 Table of Contents YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 We recorded rental revenues of $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $5.6 million or 3.0% when compared to 2008 rental revenues of $188.7 million. Of the decrease in rental revenue, $6.3 million resulted from a 3.3% decrease in rental revenues at the 342 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2008). The decrease in same store rental revenues was a result of a 2.1% decrease in average rental income per square foot as a result of increased move in incentives used in 2009 to attract customers. We also experienced a decrease in square foot occupancy of 115 basis points, which we believe resulted from general economic conditions, in particular the housing sector. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in rental revenues resulting from having the three stores acquired in 2008 included for a full year of operations. Other income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance commissions, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased in 2009 primarily as a result of $0.3 million increase in commissions earned from our customer insurance program. Property operating expenses decreased $2.9 million or 5.4%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Much of the decrease resulted from numerous expense control initiatives and from a reduction in yellow page advertising at the 342 core properties considered same stores. Property tax expense increased $0.9 million as a result of a 4.0% increase in property taxes at the 342 core properties and from having the 2008 acquisitions included for a full year of operations. General and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million or 7.9% from 2008 to 2009. The increase primarily resulted from the write off of construction in progress projects that were terminated and an increase in internet advertising. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $32.7 million in 2009 from $33.3 million in 2008, primarily as a result of a $1.0 million decrease in amortization of in place customers leases relating to previous year acquisitions, offset partially by a full year of depreciation on those acquisitions. Interest expense increased from $38.1 million in 2008 to $50.1 million in 2009 as a result of the 2009 credit ratings downgrade, covenant violation, termination of interest rate swaps, and the write off of unamortized financing fees noted in the comparison of 2010 versus 2009. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations (FFO) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT) as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. 26 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 40,642 $ 19,916 $ 37,399 $ 37,958 $ 34,098 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,899 1,738 2,284 2,631 2,434 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 32,939 32,736 33,252 32,779 24,119 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 217 1,083 1,215 1,257 1,186 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 788 820 333 59 168 Casualty gain (114 ) (Gain) loss on sale of real estate (6,944 ) 509 (716 ) Funds from operations allocable to noncontrolling interest in Operating Partnership (885 ) (984 ) (1,366 ) (1,425 ) (1,450 ) Funds from operations allocable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures (1,360 ) (1,360 ) (1,564 ) (1,848 ) (1,785 ) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $ 67,296 $ 54,458 $ 70,837 $ 71,297 $ 58,770 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness, and limitations on dividend payouts. At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The most sensitive covenant is the leverage ratio covenant contained in our line of credit and term note agreements. This covenant limits our total consolidated liabilities to 55% of our gross asset value. At December 31, 2010, our leverage ratio as defined in the agreements was approximately 42.4%. The agreements define total consolidated liabilities to include the liabilities of the Company plus our share of liabilities of unconsolidated joint ventures. The agreements also define a prescribed formula for determining gross asset value which incorporates the use of a 9.25% capitalization rate applied to annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as defined in the agreements. In 2009, the Company had violated the leverage ratio covenant contained in the line of credit and term note agreements and obtained a waiver of the violation. The fees paid to obtain the waiver were approximately $0.9 million and are included in interest expense in 2009. In the event that the Company violates debt covenants in the future, the amounts due under the agreements could be callable by the lenders. On October 5, 2009, the Company completed the public offering of 4,025,000 shares of its common stock at $29.75 per share. Net proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses were approximately $114.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay $100 million of the Companys unsecured term note due June 2012 and to terminate two interest rate swaps relating to the debt repaid at a cost of $8.4 million. The Company used the remaining proceeds along with operating cash flows to payoff a maturing mortgage in December 2009 of $26.1 million. We believe that the steps the Company has taken, including but not limited to the equity raised from our 2009 common stock offering of approximately $114.0 million, the pay down of $100 million of our term notes in 27 Table of Contents 2009, and the reduction in the quarterly dividend as discussed in our distribution policy on page 7, will be adequate to avoid future covenant violations under the current terms of our line of credit and term note agreements. Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities and the availability on our line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through June 2011, at which time our revolving line of credit matures. At our option the revolving line of credit can be extended for one year until June 2012 for a fee of 0.25%. Future draws on our line of credit may be limited due to covenant restrictions. Cash flows from operating activities were $73.7 million, $59.1 million and $77.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net income as a result of reduced interest expense. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in net income. The decrease in net income was primarily a result of lower rental income and increased interest expense. Cash used in investing activities was $32.6 million, $4.4 million, and $82.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively. The increase in cash used from 2009 to 2010 was due to the purchase of seven storage facilities in 2010 for $34.7 million. No facilities were purchased in 2009. In addition, the proceeds from the sale of the ten stores in 2010 of $23.7 million exceeded the proceeds from the five stores sold in 2009 of $16.3 million. The decrease in cash used from 2008 to 2009 was due to (i) reduced acquisition and capital improvement activity in 2009, (ii) an increase in proceeds from the sale of storage facilities in 2009, and (iii) a reduction in the funding of our share of the joint venture entered into in 2008. Cash used in financing activities was $46.0 million in 2010, compared to $48.5 million in 2009 and cash provided by financing activities of $6.1 million in 2008. In 2010, our financing activities were generally limited to a net $10.0 million draw on our line of credit as well as our recurring dividends, distributions, and mortgage principal payments. In 2009, we used our operating cash flow and the proceeds from our common stock offering to paydown $14.0 million of our line of credit, $100 million of term notes, and a $26.1 million mortgage. In 2008, the excess proceeds from refinancing our term notes with a new $250.0 million term note primarily resulted in the net cash provided by financing activities. In 2008, we entered into agreements relating to unsecured credit arrangements, and received funds under those arrangements. As part of the agreements, the Company entered into a $250 million unsecured term note maturing in June 2012 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.625% (based on the Companys December 31, 2010 credit rating). The proceeds from this term note were used to repay the Companys previous line of credit that was to mature in September 2008, the Companys term note that was to mature in September 2009, the term note maturing in July 2008, and to provide for working capital. We repaid $100 million of this term note with the proceeds of our common stock offering in October 2009. The agreements also provide for a $125 million revolving line of credit maturing June 2011 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375% (based on the Companys credit rating at December 31, 2010), and requires a 0.25% facility fee. The interest rate at December 31, 2010 on the Companys available line of credit was approximately 1.64% (1.61% at December 31, 2009). At December 31, 2010, there was $115 million available on the unsecured line of credit. We believe that if operating results remain consistent with historical levels and levels of other debt and liabilities remain consistent with amounts outstanding at December 31, 2010, the remaining $115 million available on our line of credit could be drawn without violating our debt covenants. We also maintain a $80 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26%, a $20 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%, and a $150 million unsecured term note maturing in April 2016 bearing interest at 6.38% (based on our December 31, 2010 credit ratings). 28 Table of Contents Our line of credit facility and term notes have an investment grade rating from Standard and Poors and Fitch Ratings (BBB ). In May 2009, due to our debt covenant violation and operating trends, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Companys rating on its revolving credit facility and term notes to non investment grade (BB). As a result of our common stock offering in October 2009 and the use of proceeds to repay $100 million of term notes, Fitch Ratings upgraded our rating on our line of credit and term notes again to investment grade (BBB ). In addition to the unsecured financing mentioned above, our consolidated financial statements also include $79.0 million of mortgages payable as detailed below: * 7.80% mortgage note due December 2011, secured by 11 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran I) with an aggregate net book value of $42.0 million, principal and interest paid monthly. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2010 on this mortgage was $27.8 million. * 7.19% mortgage note due March 2012, secured by 27 self storage facilities (Locke Sovran II) with an aggregate net book value of $80.1 million, principal and interest paid monthly.

The 7.80% and 7.19% mortgages were incurred in 2001 and 2002 respectively as part of the financing of the consolidated joint ventures. The Company assumed the 7.25%, 6.76%, 6.35%, and 7.50% mortgage notes in connection with the acquisitions of storage facilities in 2005 and 2006. Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan was suspended in November 2009, and therefore we did not issue any shares under this plan in 2010. During 2009, we issued approximately 1.4 million shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and the Employee Stock Option Plan. We received $32.6 million from the sale of such shares. We may reinstate our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan in 2011. During 2010 and 2009, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2010, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. Future acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program, and share repurchases are expected to be funded with draws on our line of credit, issuance of common and preferred stock, the issuance of unsecured term notes, sale of properties, and private placement solicitation of joint venture equity. Should the capital market revert back to 2009 conditions, we may have to curtail acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program, and share repurchases as we approach June 2011, when our line of credit matures. At our option, the revolving line of credit can be extended for one year until June 2012 for a fee of 0.25%. 29 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Contractual Payments due by period obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 and thereafter Line of credit $ 10.0 million $ 10.0 million Term notes $ 400.0 million $ 250.0 million $ 150.0 million Mortgages payable $ 79.0 million $ 38.1 million $ 40.0 million $ 0.9 million Interest payments $ 75.5 million $ 23.4 million $ 30.5 million $ 19.2 million $ 2.4 million Interest rate swap payments $ 10.5 million $ 7.0 million $ 3.5 million Land lease $ 1.0 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.7 million Building leases $ 2.9 million $ 0.6 million $ 1.4 million $ 0.9 million Total $ 578.9 million $ 79.2 million $ 325.5 million $ 21.1 million $ 153.1 million Interest payments include actual interest on fixed rate debt and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on December 31, 2010 rates. Interest rate swap payments include net settlements of swap liabilities based on forecasted variable rates. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES During 2010, we used the proceeds from the sale of the ten Properties and borrowings pursuant to our line of credit to acquire seven Properties in North Carolina comprising 0.5 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. We acquired no properties in 2009. During 2008, we used operating cash flow, borrowings pursuant to our line of credit, borrowings under the bank term note, and proceeds from our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan to acquire three Properties in Mississippi and Ohio comprising 0.2 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand into new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. We are actively pursuing acquisitions in 2011 but as of December 31, 2010 we had no properties under contract to purchase. In 2010, we added 162,000 square feet to existing Properties, and converted 6,500 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $9 million. In 2009 spent approximately $18 million to add 175,000 square feet to existing Properties, and to convert 64,000 square feet to premium storage. We also completed construction of a new 78,000 square foot facility in Richmond, Virginia. Although we do not expect to construct any new facilities in 2011, we do plan to expend up to $32 million to expand and enhance existing facilities. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2010 we sold ten non strategic storage facilities located in Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Virginia for net cash proceeds of $23.7 million resulting in a gain of $6.9 million. During 2009, we sold five non strategic storage facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. During 2008, we sold one non strategic storage facility located in Michigan for net cash proceeds of $7.0 million resulting in a gain of $0.7 million. 30 Table of Contents We may seek to sell additional Properties to third parties or joint venture programs in 2011. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have a 20% ownership interest in Sovran HHF Storage Holdings LLC (Sovran HHF), a joint venture that was formed in May 2008 to acquire self storage properties that are managed by us. The carrying value of our investment at December 31, 2010 was $19.7 million. Twenty five properties were acquired by Sovran HHF as of December 31, 2008 for approximately $171.5 million. We contributed $18.6 million to the joint venture as our share of capital required to fund the acquisitions. As manager of Sovran HHF, we earn a management and call center fee of 7% of gross revenues which totaled $1.3 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also received an acquisition fee of 0.5% or $0.7 million of purchase price for securing purchases for the joint venture in 2008. Our share of Sovran HHFs income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, Sovran HHF owed us $0.3 million for payments made by us on behalf of the joint venture. We also have a 49% ownership interest in Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC, which owns the building that houses the Companys headquarters and other tenants. Our investment includes a capital contribution of $49. The carrying value of our investment is a liability of $0.6 million at December 31, 2010 and $0.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our share of Iskalo Office Holdings, LLCs (loss) income was ($79,000), $7,000, and ($6,000), respectively. We paid rent to Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC of $644,000, $608,000, and $600,000 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under the lease are $0.6 million per year through 2015.

We do not guarantee the debt of Sovran HHF or Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC. A summary of our cash flows arising from the off balance sheet arrangements with Sovran HHF and Iskalo Office Holdings, LLC for the three years ended December 31, 2010 are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Statement of Operations Other operating income (management fees and acquisition fee income) $ 1,260 $ 1,243 $ 1,135 General and administrative expenses (corporate office rent) 644 608 600 Equity in income of joint ventures 241 235 104 Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 494 686 345 Investing activities Investment in joint ventures (331 ) (20,287 ) (Advances to) reimbursement of advances to joint ventures (80 ) 163 (336 ) REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2011 may be applied toward our 2010 distribution requirement. As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2010, our percentage of revenue from such sources was approximately 97%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. INTEREST RATE RISK We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2010, we have three outstanding interest rate swap agreements as summarized below: Fixed Floating Rate Notional Amount Effective Date Expiration Date Rate Paid Received $20 Million 9/4/05 9/4/13 4.4350 % 6 month LIBOR $50 Million 7/1/08 6/25/12 4.2825 % 1 month LIBOR $100 Million 7/1/08 6/22/12 4.2965 % 1 month LIBOR Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $170 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. Through June 2012, $400 million of our $410 million of unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account the interest rate swaps noted above. Based on our outstanding unsecured debt of $410 million at December 31, 2010, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have a $0.1 million effect on our interest expense. 32 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our debt obligations and interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2010. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and is dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange. Expected Maturity Date Including Discount Fair (dollars in thousands) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Value Line of credit variable rate LIBOR 1.375 (1.64% at December 31, 2010) $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 Notes Payable: Term note variable rate LIBOR1.625% (1.89% at December 31, 2010) $ 150,000 $ 150,000 $ 150,000 Term note variable rate LIBOR1.50% (2.00% at December 31, 2010) $ 20,000 $ 20,000 $ 20,000 Term note fixed rate 6.26% $ 80,000 $ 80,000 $ 79,914 Term note fixed rate 6.38% $ 150,000 $ 150,000 $ 145,152 Mortgage note fixed rate 7.80% $ 27,817 $ 27,817 $ 28,561 Mortgage note fixed rate 7.19% $ 1,301 $ 38,963 $ 40,264 $ 41,612 Mortgage note fixed rate 7.25% $ 3,220 $ 3,220 $ 3,255 Mortgage note fixed rate 6.76% $ 27 $ 29 $ 896 $ 952 $ 993 Mortgage note fixed rate 6.35% $ 30 $ 31 $ 34 $ 949 $ 1,044 $ 1,084 Mortgage notes fixed rate 7.50% $ 5,657 $ 5,657 $ 5,746 Interest rate derivatives liability $ 10,528 INFLATION We do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on our operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. Item 7A.
