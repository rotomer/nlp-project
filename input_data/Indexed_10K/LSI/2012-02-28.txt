Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this document, the words intends, believes, expects, anticipates, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of competition from new self storage facilities, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; the Companys ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired businesses into the Companys existing business and operations; the Companys ability to effectively compete in the industry in which it does business; the Companys existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment, preventing refinancing or forcing refinancing of the indebtedness on terms that are not as favorable as the existing terms; interest rates may fluctuate, impacting costs associated with the Companys outstanding floating rate debt; the Companys ability to comply with debt covenants; any future ratings on the Companys debt instruments; the regional concentration of the Companys business may subject it to economic downturns in the states of Florida and Texas; the Companys reliance on its call center; the Companys cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of operating expenses, principal, interest and dividends; and tax law changes that may change the taxability of future income. Business and Overview We believe we are the fifth largest operator of self storage properties in the United States based on facilities owned and managed. All of our stores are operated under the user friendly name Uncle Bobs Self Storage&reg;. Operating Strategy Our operating strategy is designed to generate growth and enhance value by: A. Increasing operating performance and cash flow through aggressive management of our stores: We seek to differentiate our self storage facilities from our competition through innovative marketing and value added product offerings including: Our Customer Care Center, established in 2000, answers sales inquires and makes reservations for all of our Properties on a centralized basis. Further, our call center and customer contact software was developed in house and is 100% supported by our in house experts. This brings us flexibility well beyond that of any operator using off the shelf software; The Uncle Bobs truck move in program, under which, at present, 276 of our stores offer a free Uncle Bobs truck to assist our customers moving into their spaces, and acts as a moving billboard further supporting our branding efforts; Our dehumidification system, known as Dri guard, which provides our customers with a better environment to store their goods and improves yields on our Properties; Aggressive and efficient Web and Mobile marketing which rank our websites highly and make Uncle Bobs stand out among the competitors; Regional marketing which creates effective brand awareness in the cities where we do business. 22 Table of Contents Our customized computer applications link each of our primary sales channels (customer care center, web, and store) allowing for real time access to space type and inventory, pricing, promotions, and other pertinent store information. This also provides us with raw data on historical and current pricing, move in and move out activity, specials and occupancies, etc. This data is then used within the advanced pricing analytics programs employed by our revenue management team. Our store managers are better qualified and receive a high level of training. New store employees are assigned a Certified Training Manager as a mentor during their initial training period. In addition, all employees have access to our online Learning and Performance Management System internally named eBOB for initial training as well as continuing education. Finally, we have a company intranet that acts as a communications portal for company policy and procedures, online ordering, incentive rankings, etc. B. Acquiring additional stores: Our objective is to acquire new stores in markets in which we currently operate. This is a proven strategy we have employed over the years as it facilitates our branding efforts, grows market share, and allows us to achieve improved economies of scale through shared advertising, payroll, and other services. We also look to enter new markets that are in the top 50 MSA by acquiring established multi property portfolios. With this strategy we are then able to seek out additional acquisition or third party management opportunities to continue to grow market share, branding and enhance economies of scale. C. Expanding our management business: We see our management business as a source of future acquisitions. In 2011 we entered into another joint venture in which we retained a 15% ownership interest and manage the 20 self storage facilities owned by this joint venture. In addition, we entered into management contracts for nine self storage facilities for which we have no ownership. We may enter into additional management agreements and develop additional joint ventures in the future. The joint venture agreements will give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed properties in the event they are offered for sale. D. Expanding and enhancing our existing stores: Over the past five years, we have undertaken a program of expanding and enhancing our Properties. In 2008, we spent approximately $26 million to add 403,000 square feet and to convert 95,000 square feet to premium storage; in 2009, we completed construction of a new 78,000 square foot facility in Richmond Virginia, added 175,000 square feet to other existing Properties, and converted 64,000 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $18 million; in 2010, we added 162,000 square feet to existing Properties, and converted 6,500 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $9 million; and in 2011, we added 118,000 square feet to existing Properties, and converted 2,000 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $7 million. During 2011 we also installed solar panels at eight locations for a total cost of approximately $2.3 million after federal and local incentives. This initiative is expected to reduce energy consumption and reduce operating cost at those locations. Supply and Demand / Operating Trends We believe the supply and demand model in the self storage industry is micro market specific in that a majority of our business comes from within a five mile radius of our stores. The recent economic conditions and the credit market environment have resulted in a decrease in new supply on a national basis in the last four years. With the recent loosening of the debt and equity markets, we have seen capitalization rates on quality acquisitions (expected annual return on investment) decrease from approximately 7.25% to 6.75%. 23 Table of Contents We believe our industry has weathered the recent recession very well. Although our industry experienced softness in 2008 through 2011, our same store sales showed positive increases save for 2009, when we showed a 3.1% decrease in same store revenue. That was the first time in recent history that we recorded lower same store sales. We feel our recent performance further supports the notion that the self storage industry holds up well through recessions. We believe our same store move ins in 2011 were lower than 2010 for several reasons. The first being reduced upfront special promotions in 2011 as compared to 2010. The aggressive upfront concessions offered in 2010 resulted in short term customers taking advantage of the special, which resulted in a higher turnover rate in 2010. Second, the housing slowdown has impacted our industry by 1) a reduction in lease up activity resulting from fewer residential real estate transactions (both buyers and sellers of residences use our product in times of transition) and 2) a contraction of housing construction activity which has reduced the number of people working in the construction trades (trades people are a measurable part of our usual customer base.) 2011 2010 Change Year to date same store move ins 143,354 151,995 (8,641 ) Year to date same store move outs 139,236 150,608 (11,372 ) Difference 4,118 1,387 2,731 We expect conditions in most of our markets to continue the recovery that we saw in 2011 and are forecasting 2% to 4% revenue growth on a same store basis in 2012. We were able to maintain relatively flat expenses at the store operating level from 2009 through 2011. Expenses related to operating a self storage facility had increased substantially over the previous five years as a result of expanded hours, increased health care costs, property insurance costs, and the costs of amenities (such as Uncle Bobs trucks). While we do expect some store expense growth in 2012, we do believe the expense increases will be at a manageable level of between 2% and 4%. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to carrying values of storage facilities, bad debts, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Carrying value of storage facilities: We believe our judgment regarding the impairment of the carrying value of our storage facilities is a critical accounting policy. Our policy is to assess any impairment of value whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a storage facility may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances would include negative operating cash flow, significant declining revenue per storage facility, or an expectation that, more likely than not, a property will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impairment is evaluated based upon comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the storage facility, on a property by property basis. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. If cash flow projections are inaccurate and in the future it is determined that storage facility carrying values are not recoverable, impairment charges may be required at that time and could materially affect our operating results and financial position. Estimates of undiscounted cash flows could change based upon changes in market conditions, expected occupancy rates, etc. During 2011 we recorded an impairment charge at one of our stores as of a result of a structural deficiency that we have decided to address by demolishing the buildings in 2012. See further discussion in the analysis of the 2011 results compared to 2010 that follows. No assets had been determined to be impaired under this policy in 2010. 24 Table of Contents Estimated useful lives of long lived assets: We believe that the estimated lives used for our depreciable, long lived assets is a critical accounting policy. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets to determine if any changes are warranted based upon various factors, including changes in the planned usage of the assets, customer demand, etc. Changes in estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have not made significant changes to the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets in the past and we dont have any current expectation of making significant changes in 2012. Consolidation and investment in joint ventures: We consolidate all wholly owned subsidiaries. Partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures are consolidated when we control the entity or have the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of the entity. Investments in joint ventures that we do not control but for which we have significant influence over are reported using the equity method. Under the equity method, our investment in joint ventures are stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Revenue and Expense Recognition: Rental income is recognized when earned pursuant to month to month leases for storage space. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period, which is generally during the first month of occupancy. Rental income received prior to the start of the rental period is included in deferred revenue. Qualification as a REIT: We operate, and intend to continue to operate, as a REIT under the Code, but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, any requirement to pay federal income taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (ASU 2011 04). ASU 2011 04 represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the IASB (the Boards) on fair value measurements. The collective efforts of the Boards and their staffs, reflected in ASU 2011 04, have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements, including a consistent meaning of the term fair value. The Boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and IFRS. The amendments in this ASU are required to be applied prospectively, and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2011 04 will have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The amendment eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity. The amendment requires all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendment, which must be applied retrospectively, is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2011 05 in 2011 and has included a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive income in its financial statements. 25 Table of Contents YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 We recorded rental revenues of $198.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $15.3 million or 8.4% when compared to 2010 rental revenues of $182.9 million. Of the increase in rental revenue, $6.4 million resulted from a 3.5% increase in rental revenues at the 344 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2010). The increase in same store rental revenues was a result of a 3% increase in average rental income per square foot as a result of our reduced use of move in incentives. Average occupancy in 2011 was essentially flat to 2010. The remaining increase in rental revenue of $8.9 million resulted from the continued lease up of our Richmond, Virginia property constructed in 2009 and the revenues from the acquisition of 36 properties completed since January 1, 2010. Other operating income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance commissions, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased by $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increased commissions earned on customer insurance and from fees for managing the properties in the new joint venture which began operations in July 2011. We also earned a $0.7 million acquisition fee from the new joint venture in 2011. Property operations and maintenance expenses increased $3.1 million or 5.9% in 2011 compared to 2010. $0.3 million of the increase resulted from increases in personnel and maintenance at the 344 core properties considered in same store pool. The remaining increase in operating expenses of $2.8 million resulted from the 36 properties acquired since January 1, 2010. Real estate tax expense increased $1.3 million as a result of 1.7% increase in property taxes on the 344 same store pool and the inclusion of taxes on the properties acquired in 2010 and 2011. Net operating income increased $14.7 million or 12.1% as a result of a 6.2% increase in our same store net operating income and the acquisitions completed since January 1, 2010. Net operating income or NOI is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that we define as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income: interest expense, amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, impairment and casualty losses, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition related costs, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income: income from discontinued operations, interest income, gain on sale of real estate, and equity in income of joint ventures. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income. There are material limitations to using a measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income. We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income. The following table reconciles NOI generated by our self storage facilities to our net income presented in the December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 consolidated financial statements. 26 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Net operating income Same store $ 127,049 $ 119,613 $ 119,558 Other stores and management fee income 8,790 1,549 1,401 Total net operating income 135,839 121,162 120,959 General and administrative (25,986 ) (21,071 ) (18,649 ) Acquisition related costs (3,278 ) (786 ) Depreciation and amortization (36,578 ) (32,939 ) (32,736 ) Impairment of real estate (1,047 ) Interest expense (38,549 ) (31,711 ) (50,050 ) Interest income 83 84 85 Casualty loss (126 ) (390 ) Gain on sale of land 1,511 1,127 Equity in (losses) income of joint ventures (340 ) 240 235 Income from discontinued operations 7,562 1,073 Net income $ 31,529 $ 42,541 $ 21,654 Our 2011 same store results consist of only those properties that were included in our consolidated results since January 1, 2010, excluding the one property we developed in 2009. The following table sets forth operating data for our 344 same store properties. These results provide information relating to property operating changes without the effects of acquisition. Same Store Summary Year ended December 31, Percentage (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Change Same store rental income $ 189,014 $ 182,635 3.5 % Same store other operating income 9,144 7,519 21.6 % Total same store operating income 198,158 190,154 4.2 % Same store property operations and maintenance 51,778 51,532 0.5 % Same store real estate taxes 19,331 19,009 1.7 % Total same store operating expenses 71,109 70,541 0.8 % Same store net operating income $ 127,049 $ 119,613 6.2 % General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million or 23.3% from 2010 to 2011. The key drivers of the increase were a $2.2 million increase in salaries and performance incentives, $0.8 million increase in internet advertising, and a $1.1 million increase in costs associated with training and onboarding new owned and or managed stores. Acquisition related costs increased by $2.5 million as a result of the 29 stores acquired in 2011 compared to seven stores acquired in 2010. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $36.6 million in 2011 from $32.9 million in 2010, primarily as a result of depreciation on the 36 properties acquired in 2010 and 2011. The impairment charge related to a building that was determined to have a structural deficiency in 2011. A decision was made to demolish and rebuild this building in 2012, and we have written off the value of the building. Interest expense increased from $31.7 million in 2010 to $38.5 million in 2011 mainly due to the $5.5 million that was paid to terminate two interest rate swap agreements related to the $150 million term note that was repaid as part of our debt refinancing in August 2011. 27 Table of Contents The casualty loss recorded in 2011 relates to insurance proceeds received that were less than the carrying value of two buildings damaged by fire. During 2011, we sold three parcels of land to various municipalities for their use as part of road widening projects for net cash proceeds of $2.0 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.5 million. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from $1.9 million in 2010 to $0.9 million in 2011 as a result of our May 2011 additional investment in Locke Sovran II, LLC in which we purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in that entity, and as a result of our lower net income. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 We recorded rental revenues of $182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $0.2 million or 0.1% when compared to 2009 rental revenues of $183.1 million. Of the decrease in rental revenue, $0.4 million resulted from a 0.2% decrease in rental revenues at the 344 core properties considered in same store sales (those properties included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2009). The decrease in same store rental revenues was a result of a small decrease in average rental income per square foot as a result of our continued use of move in incentives to attract customers. Average occupancy in 2010 was essentially flat to 2009. The decrease in same store rental income was offset by a $0.2 million increase in rental revenues resulting from the continued lease up of our Richmond Virginia property constructed in 2009 and the few days of revenues from the acquisition of seven properties completed in late December 2010. Other income, which includes merchandise sales, insurance commissions, truck rentals, management fees and acquisition fees, increased in 2010 primarily as a result of $1.0 million increase in commissions earned from our customer insurance program. Property operations and maintenance expenses increased $1.1 million or 2.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase resulted mostly from higher health insurance costs and repairs and maintenance expense, as other property expenses were kept at or below 2009 levels. Real estate tax expense decreased $0.3 million as a result of assessment reductions and municipalities holding property tax rates steady. We expect same store operating costs to increase moderately in 2011 with increases primarily attributable to employee costs, utilities, and property taxes. Net operating income increased $0.2 million or 0.2% as a result of the seven stores acquired in late 2010 as same store net operating income was flat. Our 2010 same store results consist of only those properties that were included in our consolidated results since January 1, 2009, excluding the one property we developed in 2009. The following table sets forth operating data for our 344 same store properties. These results provide information relating to property operating changes without the effects of acquisition. Same Store Summary Year ended December 31, Percentage (dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Change Same store rental income $ 182,635 $ 183,069 0.2 % Same store other operating income 7,519 6,395 17.6 % Total same store operating income 190,154 189,464 0.4 % Same store property operations and maintenance 51,532 50,561 1.9 % Same store real estate taxes 19,009 19,345 1.7 % Total same store operating expenses 70,541 69,906 0.9 % Same store net operating income $ 119,613 $ 119,558 0.0 % General and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million or 13.0% from 2009 to 2010. The key drivers of the increase were a $1.3 million increase in salaries and performance incentives, $0.5 million increase in health insurance costs, $0.4 million increase in internet advertising, and a $0.2 increase in tax expense related to our taxable REIT subsidiary. 28 Table of Contents Acquisition related costs increased by $0.8 million as a result of the seven stores acquired in 2010 compared with no stores acquired in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.9 million in 2010 from $32.7 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a full year of depreciation on the Virginia property constructed in 2009, and the depreciation on the expansions completed at existing stores. Interest expense decreased from $50.1 million in 2009 to $31.7 million in 2010 as a result of the following factors: Our credit rating remained investment grade during all of 2010. In May 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our rating on our unsecured floating rate notes which triggered a temporary 1.75% increase in the interest rate on our then outstanding $150 million term notes and a 0.375% increase in the interest rate on our $250 million term notes. The increase was effective from May to October of 2009, at which time our credit rating was upgraded back to investment grade rating after our common stock offering in October 2009; At March 31, 2009, the Company had violated the leverage ratio covenant contained in its line of credit and term note agreements. In May 2009, the Company obtained a waiver of the violation as of March 31, 2009. The fees paid to obtain the waiver were approximately $0.9 million and are included in 2009 interest expense. No such violations occurred in 2010; On October 5, 2009, the Company used proceeds from the issuance of common stock to terminate the interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $75 million and $25 million (see Note 8 of our financial statements). The total cost to terminate the swaps was $8.4 million and is included as additional interest expense in 2009. No such termination occurred in 2010, and; In October 2009, we wrote off to interest expense $0.6 million of unamortized financing fees related to the $100 million term note that was repaid with the proceeds of the common stock offering. No financing fees were written off in 2010. The casualty loss recorded in 2009 relates to insurance proceeds received that were less than the carrying value of a building damaged by a fire at one of our facilities. During 2009, we sold a parcel of land to the State of Georgia Department of Transportation for their use as part of a road widening project for net cash proceeds of $1.1 million resulting in a gain on sale of $1.1 million. As described in Note 5 to the financial statements, during 2010 the Company sold ten non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $23.7 million resulting in a gain of $6.9 million. During 2009 the Company sold five non strategic storage facilities for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. The 2010 and 2009 operations of these facilities and the loss/gain associated with the disposal are reported in income from discontinued operations for all periods presented. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We believe that Funds from Operations (FFO) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net earnings and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. FFO adds back historical cost depreciation, which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future. In fact, real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions. Consequently, we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding (or adding back) historical cost depreciation. 29 Table of Contents FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT) as net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus impairment of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. In October and November of 2011, NAREIT issued guidance for reporting FFO that reaffirmed NAREITs view that impairment write downs of depreciable real estate should be excluded from the computation of FFO. This view is based on the fact that impairment write downs are akin to and effectively reflect the early recognition of losses on prospective sales of depreciable property or represent adjustments of previously charged depreciation. Since depreciation of real estate and gains/losses from sales are excluded from FFO, it is NAREITs view that it is consistent and appropriate for write downs of depreciable real estate to also be excluded. Our calculation of FFO excludes impairment write downs of investments in storage facilities. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds From Operations For Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 30,592 $ 40,642 $ 19,916 $ 37,399 $ 37,958 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 937 1,899 1,738 2,284 2,631 Depreciation of real estate and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing fees 36,578 32,939 32,736 33,252 32,779 Depreciation of real estate included in discontinued operations 217 1,083 1,215 1,257 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures 1,018 788 820 333 59 Casualty and impairment loss (gain) 1,173 (114 ) (Gain) loss on sale of real estate (1,511 ) (6,944 ) 509 (716 ) Funds from operations allocable to noncontrolling interest in Operating Partnership (813 ) (885 ) (984 ) (1,366 ) (1,425 ) Funds from operations allocable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures (567 ) (1,360 ) (1,360 ) (1,564 ) (1,848 ) Funds from operations available to common shareholders $ 67,407 $ 67,296 $ 54,458 $ 70,837 $ 71,297 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness, and limitations on dividend payouts. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The most sensitive covenant is the leverage ratio covenant contained in certain of our term note agreements. This covenant limits our total consolidated liabilities to 55% of our gross asset value. At December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio as defined in the agreements was approximately 44.9%. The agreements define total consolidated liabilities to include the liabilities of the Company plus our share of liabilities of unconsolidated joint ventures. The agreements also define a prescribed formula for determining gross asset value which incorporates the use of a 9.25% capitalization rate applied to annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other items (Adjusted EBITDA) as defined in the agreements. In 2009, the Company had violated the leverage ratio covenant contained in the line of credit and term note agreements and obtained a waiver of the violation. The fees paid to obtain the waiver were approximately $0.9 million and are included in interest expense in 2009. In the event that the Company violates debt covenants in the future, the amounts due under the agreements could be callable by the lenders. We believe that if operating results remain consistent with historical levels and levels of other debt and liabilities remain consistent with amounts outstanding at December 31, 2011, the entire availability under our line of credit could be drawn without violating our debt covenants. Our ability to retain cash flow is limited because we operate as a REIT. In order to maintain our REIT status, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to pay dividends to our shareholders. We believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities and the availability on our line of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations, capital improvements, dividends and debt service requirements through September 2013, at which time $100 million of term notes mature. Cash flows from operating activities were $80.3 million, $73.7 million and $59.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities. The increase in operating cash flows from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net income as a result of reduced interest expense. Cash used in investing activities was $190.3 million, $32.6 million, and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. The increase in cash used from 2010 to 2011 was due to the purchase of 29 storage facilities in 2011 for $150.4 million and the $13.6 million investment in the new unconsolidated joint venture entered in 2011. The increase in cash used from 2009 to 2010 was due to the purchase of seven storage facilities in 2010 for $34.7 million. No facilities were purchased in 2009. In addition, the proceeds from the sale of the ten stores in 2010 of $23.7 million exceeded the proceeds from the five stores sold in 2009 of $16.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $111.5 million in 2011, compared to cash used in financing activities of $46.0 million in 2010 and $48.5 million in 2009. In 2011, we realized $47.0 million from the sale of our common stock through our at the market equity offering and $211.0 million in proceeds, net of repayments, from our new credit agreements to fund our acquisitions, joint venture activity and mortgage payoffs of $77.0 million. In 2010, our financing activities were generally limited to a net $10.0 million draw on our line of credit as well as our recurring dividends, distributions, and mortgage principal payments. In 2009, we used our operating cash flow and the proceeds from our common stock offering to make net repayments of $14.0 million on our line of credit, to repay $100 million of term notes, and to make $28.0 million in mortgage principal payments. On August 5, 2011, we entered into agreements relating to new unsecured credit arrangements, and received funds under those arrangements. As part of the agreements, we entered into a $125 million unsecured term note maturing in August 2018 bearing interest at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Companys credit rating (at December 31, 2011 the margin is 2.0%). The agreements also provide for a $175 million (expandable to $250 million) revolving line of credit bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on the Companys credit rating (at December 31, 2011 the margin is 2.0%), and requires a 0.20% facility fee. The interest rate at December 31, 2011 on the Companys available line of credit was approximately 2.28% (1.64% at December 31, 2010). The proceeds from this term note and draws on the new line of credit were used to repay the Companys 31 Table of Contents previous line of credit and the Companys $150 million bank term note that was to mature June 2012. At December 31, 2011, there was $129 million available on the unsecured line of credit without considering the additional availability under the expansion feature. The revolving line of credit has a maturity date of August 2016, but can be extended for 2 one year periods at the Companys option with the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.125% of the total line of credit commitment. In addition, on August 5, 2011, we secured an additional $100 million term note with a delayed draw feature that was used to fund the Companys mortgage maturities in December 2011. The delayed draw term note matures August 2018 and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Companys credit rating (at December 31, 2011 the margin is 2.0%). On August 5, 2011, we also entered into a $100 million term note maturing August 2021 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.54%. The interest rate on the term note increases to 7.29% if the notes are not rated by at least one rating agency, the credit rating on the notes is downgraded or if the Companys credit rating is downgraded. The proceeds from this term note were used to fund acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. We also maintain an $80 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.26%, a $20 million term note maturing September 2013 bearing interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%, and a $150 million unsecured term note maturing in April 2016 bearing interest at 6.38%. The interest rate on the $150 million unsecured term note increases to 8.13% if the notes are not rated by at least one rating agency, the credit rating on the notes is downgraded or the Companys credit rating is downgraded. The line of credit and term notes require us to meet certain financial covenants, measured on a quarterly basis, including prescribed leverage, fixed charge coverage, minimum net worth, limitations on additional indebtedness and limitations on dividend payouts. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. Our line of credit facility and term notes have an investment grade rating from Standard and Poors and Fitch Ratings (BBB ). In May 2009, due to our debt covenant violation and operating trends, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Companys rating on its revolving credit facility and term notes to non investment grade (BB+). As a result of our common stock offering in October 2009 and the use of proceeds to repay $100 million of term notes, Fitch Ratings upgraded our rating on our line of credit and term notes again to investment grade (BBB ). In addition to the unsecured financing mentioned above, our consolidated financial statements also include $4.4 million of mortgages payable that are secured by three storage facilities. On September 14, 2011, the Company entered into a continuous equity offering program (Equity Program) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (Wells Fargo), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time up to $125 million in aggregate offering price of shares of the Companys common stock. Actual sales under the Equity Program will depend on a variety of factors and conditions, including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the Companys common stock, and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. The Company expects to continue to offer, sell, and issue shares of common stock under the Equity Program from time to time based on various factors and conditions, although the Company is under no obligation to sell any shares under the Equity Program. During 2011, the Company issued 1,166,875 shares of common stock under the Equity Program at a weighted average issue price of $40.59 per share, generating net proceeds of $46.4 million after deducting $0.9 million of sales commissions payable to Wells Fargo. In addition to sales commissions paid to Wells Fargo, the Company incurred expenses of $0.4 million in connection with the Equity Program during 2011. The Company used the proceeds from the Equity Program to reduce the outstanding balance under the Companys revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $77.6 million available for issuance under the Equity Program. 32 Table of Contents On October 5, 2009, the Company completed the public offering of 4,025,000 shares of its common stock at $29.75 per share. Net proceeds to the Company after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses were approximately $114.0 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay $100 million of the Companys unsecured term note due June 2012 and to terminate two interest rate swaps relating to the debt repaid at a cost of $8.4 million. The Company used the remaining proceeds along with operating cash flows to payoff a maturing mortgage in December 2009 of $26.1 million. Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan was suspended in November 2009, and therefore we did not issue any shares under this plan in 2011. During 2009, we issued approximately 1.4 million shares via our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and the Employee Stock Option Plan. We received $32.6 million from the sale of such shares. We expect to reinstate our dividend reinvestment plan in 2012. During 2011 and 2010, we did not acquire any shares of our common stock via the Share Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors. From the inception of the Share Repurchase Program through December 31, 2011, we have reacquired a total of 1,171,886 shares pursuant to this program. From time to time, subject to market price and certain loan covenants, we may reacquire additional shares. Future acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program, and share repurchases are expected to be funded with draws on our line of credit, issuance of common and preferred stock, the issuance of unsecured term notes, sale of properties, and private placement solicitation of joint venture equity. Should the capital markets deteriorate, we may have to curtail acquisitions, our expansion and enhancement program, and share repurchases as we approach September 2013, when certain term notes mature. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 andthereafter Line of credit $ 46.0 million $ 46.0 million Term notes $ 575.0 million $ 100.0 million $ 150.0 million $ 325.0 million Mortgages payable $ 4.4 million $ 0.2 million $ 2.1 million $ 0.3 million $ 1.8 million Interest payments $ 144.5 million $ 27.3 million $ 47.3 million $ 35.8 million $ 34.1 million Interest rate swap payments $ 10.7 million $ 4.8 million $ 1.3 million $ 1.0 million $ 3.6 million Land lease $ 1.0 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.1 million $ 0.7 million Expansion and enhancement contracts $ 7.5 million $ 7.5 million Contribution to joint venture for acquisitions under contract $ 4.3 million $ 4.3 million Building leases $ 2.9 million $ 0.7 million $ 1.5 million $ 0.7 million Total $ 796.3 million $ 44.9 million $ 152.3 million $ 233.9 million $ 365.2 million Interest payments include actual interest on fixed rate debt and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on December 31, 2011 rates. Interest rate swap payments include net settlements of swap liabilities based on forecasted variable rates. 33 Table of Contents ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES In 2011, we acquired 29 self storage facilities comprising 2.0 million square feet in New Jersey (3), Florida (1), Georgia (1), Missouri (1), Texas (22), and Virginia (1) for a total purchase price of $155.1 million. Based on the trailing financials of the entities from which the properties were acquired, the weighted average capitalization rate was 7.6% on these purchases and ranged from 5.3% to 8.4%. During 2010, we used the proceeds from the sale of the ten Properties and borrowings pursuant to our line of credit to acquire seven Properties in North Carolina comprising 0.5 million square feet from unaffiliated storage operators. We acquired no properties in 2009. FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS Our external growth strategy is to increase the number of facilities we own by acquiring suitable facilities in markets in which we already have operations, or to expand into new markets by acquiring several facilities at once in those new markets. We are actively pursuing acquisitions in 2012 and at December 31, 2011 we had 10 properties under contract to be purchased by the joint venture we entered in 2011 in which we have a 15% ownership. The properties were acquired by the joint venture in February 2012 for $29 million and the Companys capital contribution was approximately $4.3 million. In 2011, we added 118,000 square feet to existing Properties, and converted 2,000 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $7.2 million. In 2010, we added 162,000 square feet to existing Properties, and converted 6,500 square feet to premium storage for a total cost of approximately $9 million. In 2009, we spent approximately $18 million to add 175,000 square feet to existing Properties, and to convert 64,000 square feet to premium storage. We also completed construction of a new 78,000 square foot facility in Richmond, Virginia. Although we do not expect to construct any new facilities in 2012, we do plan to complete approximately $20 million in expansions and enhancements to existing facilities of which $12.5 million was paid prior to December 31, 2011. In 2011, the Company spent approximately $14.6 million for recurring capitalized expenditures including roofing, painting, paving, and office renovations. We expect to spend $14.1 million in 2012 on similar capital expenditures. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES During 2010 we sold ten non strategic storage facilities located in Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Virginia for net cash proceeds of $23.7 million resulting in a gain of $6.9 million. During 2009, we sold five non strategic storage facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania for net cash proceeds of $16.3 million resulting in a loss of $1.6 million. We are seeking to sell additional Properties to third parties or joint venture programs in 2012. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our off balance sheet arrangements consist of our investment in two self storage joint ventures in which we have a 20% and 15% ownership, as well as our investment in the entity that owns the building that houses our corporate office in which we have a 49% ownership. We account for these real estate entities under the equity method. The debt held by the unconsolidated real estate entity is secured by the real estate owned by these entities, and is non recourse to us. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. REIT QUALIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS As a REIT, we are not required to pay federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders, provided that the amount distributed is equal to at least 90% of our taxable income. These distributions must be made in the year to which they relate, or in the following year if declared before we file our federal income tax return, and if it is paid before the first regular dividend of the following year. The first distribution of 2012 may be applied toward our 2011 distribution requirement. 34 Table of Contents As a REIT, we must derive at least 95% of our total gross income from income related to real property, interest and dividends. In 2011, our percentage of revenue from such sources was approximately 96%, thereby passing the 95% test, and no special measures are expected to be required to enable us to maintain our REIT designation. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election. INTEREST RATE RISK The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. Upon renewal or replacement of the credit facility, our total interest may change dependent on the terms we negotiate with the lenders; however, the LIBOR base rates have been contractually fixed on $245 million of our debt through the interest rate swap termination dates. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Through September 2013, $245 million of our $291 million of floating rate unsecured debt is on a fixed rate basis after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements. Based on our outstanding unsecured debt of $291 million at December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have a $0.5 million effect on our interest expense. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate hedge agreements in effect on December 31, 2011. These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure. INFLATION We do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct effect on our operations. Substantially all of the leases at the facilities are on a month to month basis which provides us with the opportunity to increase rental rates as each lease matures. SEASONALITY Our revenues typically have been higher in the third and fourth quarters, primarily because self storage facilities tend to experience greater occupancy during the late spring, summer and early fall months due to the greater incidence of residential moves and college student activity during these periods. However, we believe that our customer mix, diverse geographic locations, rental structure and expense structure provide adequate protection against undue fluctuations in cash flows and net revenues during off peak seasons. Thus, we do not expect seasonality to affect materially distributions to shareholders. Item 7A.
