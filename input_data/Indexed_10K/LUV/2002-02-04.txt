ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR IN REVIEW In 2001, Southwest posted a profit for the 29th consecutive year in one of the most challenging operating environments the air travel industry has ever faced. During the year, Southwest also increased our domestic market share, made enhancements that will improve our Customer Service, and ended the year with more Employees and aircraft than we had when we began the year. Despite the onset of a recession early in 2001 and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States (the terrorist attacks), Southwest was profitable in each quarter of the year, including the third and fourth quarters after excluding federal grants recognized in these quarters under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act). (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the terrorist attacks and the Act.) Although we were unable to match some of the Companys record setting performance levels reached in 2000, our business strategy primarily short haul, high frequency, low fare, point to point, high quality Customer Service continued to serve us well during some difficult times in 2001. In 2001, we continued to maintain our cost advantage over our industry while the recession and events of September 11 put downward pressure on revenues. In response to uncertainties following September 11 and the precipitous drop in demand for air travel, Southwest amended its agreement with The Boeing Company to defer aircraft deliveries (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) but did not ground airplanes, reduce service, or furlough Employees. Following the temporary FAA shutdown of U.S. air space following the terrorist attacks, load factors have steadily improved to somewhat normal, average historical levels. However, these load factors have resulted from significant fare discounting, which continues to result in year over year declines in passenger revenue yields per RPM (passenger yields) and operating revenue yields per ASM. As we begin 2002, in addition to the difficult revenue environment for commercial airlines, the Company is faced with increased war risk insurance and passenger security costs resulting from continually evolving security laws and directives. In response to the terrorist attacks, the airline industry has worked diligently with Congress, the DOT, the FAA, and law enforcement officials to enhance security. During fourth quarter 2001, the Company was able to offset these additional costs because of lower jet fuel prices and through internal cost reduction initiatives implemented following the terrorist attacks. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to offset future cost increases resulting from the changing commercial airline environment. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement that involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Some significant factors include, but may not be limited to, additional laws or directives that could increase the Companys costs or result in changes to the Companys operations, etc.) During 2001, we began service to two new cities, West Palm Beach, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia, while also discontinuing service to San Francisco International Airport due to airport congestion. We have been pleased with the initial results in both of the new Southwest cities. Prior to September 11, the Company also continued to add flights between cities already served. Southwest ended 2001 serving 58 cities in 30 states. Immediately following the terrorist attacks, Southwest suspended fleet growth. However, by the end of the year, Southwest had announced plans for modest growth to resume in early 2002. 12 Currently, available seat mile (ASM) capacity is expected to grow approximately 3.5 percent in 2002 with the planned net addition of at least 8 aircraft. The Company will place in service at least 11 new Boeing 737 700s scheduled for delivery during the year and will retire three of the Companys older 737 200s. (The immediately preceding sentences are forward looking statements that involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Some significant factors include, but may not be limited to, future capacity decisions made by the Company, demand for air travel, changes in the Companys aircraft retirement schedule, etc.) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 The Companys consolidated net income for 2001 was $511.1 million ($.63 per share, diluted), as compared to 2000 net income, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, of $625.2 million ($.79 per share, diluted), a decrease of 18.2 percent. The prior years net income per share amounts have been restated for the 2001 three for two stock split (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Consolidated results for 2001 included $235 million in gains that the Company recognized from grants under the Act and special pre tax charges of approximately $48 million arising from the terrorist attacks (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the grant and special charges related to the terrorist attacks, net income for 2001 was $412.9 million ($.51 per share, diluted). The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for 2000 was $22.1 million, net of taxes of $14.0 million (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income and net income per share, diluted, after the cumulative change in accounting principle, for 2000, were $603.1 million and $.76, respectively. Operating income for 2001 was $631.1 million, a decrease of 38.2 percent compared to 2000. Following the terrorist attacks, all U.S. commercial flight operations were suspended for approximately three days. However, the Company continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses (with the exception of certain direct trip related expenditures such as fuel, landing fees, etc.). The Company cancelled approximately 9,000 flights before resuming flight operations on September 14, although we did not resume our normal pre September 11 flight schedule until September 18, 2001. Once the Company did resume operations, load factors and passenger yields were severely impacted, and ticket refund activity increased. The Company estimates that from September 11 through September 30, it incurred operating losses in excess of $130 million. The effects of the terrorist attacks continued to be felt throughout fourth quarter 2001. The Companys operating income during fourth quarter 2001 was $37.1 million, a decrease of 85.2 percent compared to fourth quarter 2000. Without consideration of any federal grant under the Act the Company expects to recognize in first quarter 2002 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), it is not yet known whether the Company will be profitable in first quarter 2002, due to uncertain economic conditions and the difficult airline industry revenue environment. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues decreased 1.7 percent due primarily to a 1.6 percent decrease in passenger revenues. The decrease in passenger revenues was a direct result of the terrorist attacks. Because of the terrorist attacks, fluctuations in passenger revenue can best be explained by discussing the year in two distinct time periods: January through August, 2001, and September through December, 2001. 13 From January through August, 2001, passenger revenues were approximately 8.7 percent higher than the same period in 2000 due primarily to an increase in capacity, as measured by ASMs, of 11.6 percent. The capacity increase was due to the addition of 14 aircraft during 2001 (all prior to September 11) and was partially offset by a decrease of 1.9 percent in passenger yield. Passenger yields decreased as a result of fare discounting by the Company and the airline industry in general as the United States economy weakened throughout the year. The Companys load factor (RPMs divided by ASMs) over this time period was 71.2 percent, compared to 71.7 percent for the same period in 2000. From September through December, 2001, passenger revenues were approximately 21.7 percent lower than the same period of 2000. Capacity increased 4.0 percent and the Companys load factor fell to 62.0 percent, compared to 68.2 percent during the same period of 2000. Passenger yields were 17.2 percent lower during this period versus the same period of 2000 due to aggressive fare sales following the terrorist attacks. For the full year, the Company experienced a 1.2 percent increase in revenue passengers carried, a 5.4 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), and a 9.0 percent increase in ASMs. The Companys load factor for 2001 was off 2.4 points to 68.1 percent and there was a 6.7 percent decrease in 2001 passenger yield. Load factors in January 2002 continued to trail those experienced in January 2001. Additionally, passenger yields remain significantly below prior year levels. As a result, the Company expects first quarter 2002 revenue per available seat mile to continue to fall below first quarter 2001 levels. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement, which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Some significant factors include, but may not be limited to, additional incidents that could cause the public to question the safety and or efficiency of air travel, competitive pressure such as fare sales and capacity changes by other carriers, general economic conditions, operational disruptions as a result of bad weather, the impact of labor issues, and variations in advance booking trends.) See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys revenue recognition policy. As a result of weak economic conditions throughout 2001, consolidated freight revenues decreased 17.6 percent. There were decreases in both the number of freight shipments and revenue per shipment. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States Postal Service made the decision to shift a portion of the mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers. As a result of this decision, the Company expects to experience a decrease in freight revenues during at least the first half of 2002 when compared to 2001. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement, which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Some significant factors include, but may not be limited to, general economic conditions, subsequent shifts in business by the United States Postal Service, and capacity changes by other carriers.) Other revenues increased 20.3 percent due primarily to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored First USA Visa card. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2001 increased 6.4 percent, compared to the 9.0 percent increase in capacity. Operating expenses per ASM decreased 2.5 percent to $.0754, compared to $.0773 in 2000, due primarily to a decrease in average jet fuel prices. The average fuel cost per gallon in 2001 was $.7086, 10.0 percent lower than the average cost per gallon in 2000 of $.7869. Excluding fuel expense, operating expenses per ASM decreased .3 percent. 14 Operating expenses per ASM for 2001 and 2000 were as follows: Increase Percent 2001 2000 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 2.51c. 2.41c. .10c. 4.1% Employee retirement plans .33 .40 (.07) (17.5) Fuel and oil 1.18 1.34 (.16) (11.9) Maintenance materials and repairs .61 .63 (.02) (3.2) Agency commissions .16 .27 (.11) (40.7) Aircraft rentals .29 .33 (.04) (12.1) Landing fees and other rentals .48 .44 .04 9.1 Depreciation .49 .47 .02 4.3 Other 1.49 1.44 .05 3.5 Total 7.54c. 7.73c. (.19)c. (2.5)% Approximately 59 percent of the increase in Salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM was due to increases in salaries and wages from higher average wage rates within certain workgroups and increased headcount due in part to the increased security requirements following the September terrorist attacks. The remaining 41 percent of the increase in Salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM was due to higher benefits costs, primarily health care costs. The Companys Ramp, Operations, and Provisioning Agents are subject to an agreement with the Transport Workers Union of America, (TWU), which became amendable in December 2000. The Company reached an agreement with the TWU, which was ratified by its membership in June 2001. The new contract becomes amendable in June 2006. The Companys Mechanics are subject to an agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the Teamsters), which became amendable in August 2001. Southwest is currently in negotiations with the Teamsters for a new contract. The Companys Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement with the TWU, which becomes amendable in June 2002. The Companys Customer Service and Reservations Agents are subject to an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which becomes amendable in November 2002. Employee retirement plans expense per ASM decreased 17.5 percent, due primarily to the decrease in Company earnings available for profitsharing. The decrease in earnings more than offset an increase in expense due to a 4th quarter amendment made to the Companys profitsharing plan. This amendment enabled the Company to take into consideration federal grants under the Act and special charges resulting from the terrorist attacks in the calculation of profitsharing. Fuel and oil expense per ASM decreased 11.9 percent, due primarily to a 10.0 percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2001 was $.7086 compared to $.7869 in 2000, including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2001 and 2000 average jet fuel prices are net of approximately $79.9 million and $113.5 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. The Companys 2001 hedging gains were calculated according to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended (SFAS 133), which the Company 15 adopted January 1, 2001. See Note 2 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As detailed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has hedges in place for approximately 60 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in 2002. Considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, we are forecasting our first quarter 2002 average fuel cost per gallon to be below first quarter 2001s average fuel cost per gallon of $.7853. The majority of the Companys near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts, which should enable the Company to continue to benefit to a large extent from a decline in jet fuel prices. (The immediately preceding two sentences are forward looking statements, which involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices, the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, and changes in the Companys overall fuel hedging strategy.) Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 3.2 percent. This decrease was due primarily to the Companys capacity growth exceeding the increase in expense. Virtually all of the Companys 2001 capacity growth versus the prior year was accomplished with new aircraft, most of which have not yet begun to incur any meaningful repair costs. The decrease in engine expense was partially offset by an increase in expense for airframe inspections and repairs. In addition to an increase in the number of airframe inspections and repairs, the cost per event increased compared to 2000. Currently, the Company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM in first quarter 2002 versus first quarter 2001. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, any unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements.) Agency commissions per ASM decreased 40.7 percent, due primarily to a change in the Companys commission rate policy. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company reduced the commission rate paid to travel agents from ten percent to eight percent for Ticketless bookings, and from ten percent to five percent for paper ticket bookings. Effective October 15, 2001, the Company reduced the commission paid to travel agents to five percent (with no cap), regardless of the type of ticket sold. Due to this most recent commission policy change in October 2001, we expect agency commissions to show a year over year decrease in first quarter 2002 on a per ASM basis. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, changes in consumer ticket purchasing habits.) Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 12.1 percent due primarily to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased. Approximately 25.9 percent of the Companys aircraft were under operating lease at December 31, 2001, compared to 27.3 percent at December 31, 2000. Based on the Companys current new aircraft delivery schedule and scheduled aircraft retirements for 2001, we expect a decline in aircraft rental expense per ASM in 2002. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, changes in the Companys current schedule for purchase and or retirement of aircraft.) Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 9.1 percent primarily as a result of the Companys expansion of facilities at several airports, including Baltimore Washington International Airport and Chicago Midway Airport. As a result of the terrorist attacks, most other major airlines have reduced their 16 flight schedules and or have retired aircraft early due to the decrease in demand for air travel. Since Southwest has not reduced the number of flights it offers, the Company expects that the airport costs it shares with other airlines on the basis of relative flights landed or passengers carried, such as landing fees and common space rentals, will increase on a per ASM basis in future periods. In fourth quarter 2001, landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 21.4 percent. The Company currently expects a similar year over year increase in first quarter 2002. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, changes in competitors flight schedules, demand for air travel, etc.) Depreciation expense per ASM increased 4.3 percent due primarily to the growth in the Companys aircraft fleet prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Company had received delivery of 14 new 737 700 aircraft prior to September 11, bringing the percentage of owned aircraft in the Companys fleet to 74.1 percent by the end of 2001 compared to 72.7 percent at the end of 2000. Other operating expenses per ASM increased 3.5 percent due primarily to a significant increase in passenger liability, aircraft hull, and third party liability insurance costs following the terrorist attacks. The Companys insurance carriers cancelled their war risk and terrorism insurance policies following the terrorist attacks and reinstated such coverage at significantly higher rates than before. Although the Company was reimbursed for a portion of the higher rates by the federal government for one month during fourth quarter 2001, we have assumed no further reimbursements. As a result, the Company currently expects continued year over year increases in insurance costs for the near term future, including first quarter 2002. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, the financial stability of companies offering insurance policies to the airline industry, the level of competition within the insurance industry, etc.) OTHER "Other expenses (income)" included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense was flat compared to the prior year. Following the terrorist attacks, the Company borrowed the full $475 million available under its revolving credit facility and issued $614.3 million in long term debt in the form of Pass Through Certificates (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The increase in expense caused by these borrowings was offset by a decrease in interest rates on the Companys floating rate debt and the July 2001 redemption of $100 million of unsecured notes. Based on the Companys recent borrowings, we expect interest expense to be higher on a year over year basis in first quarter 2002. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited to, subsequent financing decisions made by the Company.) Capitalized interest decreased 25.3 percent primarily as a result of lower 2001 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries compared to 2000. The lower progress payments were due in part to the deferral of Boeing 737 aircraft firm orders and options following the terrorist attacks. Interest income increased 6.2 percent due primarily to higher invested cash balances, partially offset by lower rates of return. Other gains in 2001 resulted primarily from $235 million received as the Companys share of government grant funds under the Act provided to offset the Companys direct and incremental losses following the terrorist attacks, through the end of 2001. The Company expects to receive up to an additional $50 million in 2002, but determined that due to some uncertainties regarding the amount to be received, accrual of any amounts in 2001 as a receivable was not proper. (The immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results. Such uncertainties include, but may not be limited 17 to, subsequent modifications or amendments to the Act, interpretations of the meaning of direct and incremental losses, and changes in the governments expected schedule of distributing grant funds, etc.) See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Act and grants from the government. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased slightly to 38.24 percent in 2001 from 38.54 percent in 2000. The decrease resulted primarily from lower effective state tax rates in 2001. 2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 The Companys consolidated net income for 2000 before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $625.2 million ($.79 per share, diluted), an increase of 31.8 percent. The cumulative change in accounting principle, related to the adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, was $22.1 million, net of taxes of $14.0 million (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income, after the cumulative change in accounting principle, was $603.1 million. Net income per share, diluted, after consideration of the accounting change, was $.76 compared to $.59 in 1999. Operating income was $1,021.1 million, an increase of 30.7 percent compared to 1999. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased 19.3 percent due primarily to a 19.8 percent increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues primarily resulted from the Companys increased capacity, strong demand for commercial air travel, and excellent marketing and revenue management. The Company experienced a 10.7 percent increase in revenue passengers carried, a 15.7 percent increase in RPMs, and a 3.6 percent increase in passenger yield. The increase in passenger yield was due primarily to an 8.2 percent increase in average passenger fare, partially offset by a 4.6 percent increase in average length of passenger haul. The increase in average passenger fare was due primarily to modest fare increases combined with a higher mix of full fare passengers. The increase in RPMs exceeded a 13.3 percent increase in ASMs resulting in a load factor of 70.5 percent, or 1.5 points above the prior year. The increase in ASMs resulted primarily from the net addition of 32 aircraft during the year. Freight revenues increased 7.5 percent due primarily to an increase in capacity. Other revenues, which consist primarily of charter revenues, increased 1.2 percent. This increase was less than the Companys increase in capacity due primarily to the Companys decision to utilize more of its aircraft to satisfy the strong demand for scheduled service and, therefore, make fewer aircraft available for charters. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2000 increased 17.1 percent, compared to the 13.3 percent increase in capacity. Operating expenses per ASM increased 3.3 percent to $.0773, compared to $.0748 in 1999, due primarily to an increase in average jet fuel prices. The average fuel cost per gallon in 2000 was $.7869, which was the highest annual average fuel cost per gallon experienced by the Company since 1984. Excluding fuel expense, operating expenses per ASM decreased 2.6 percent. Salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM increased slightly, as increases in productivity in several of the Companys operational areas were more than offset by higher benefits costs, primarily workers compensation expense, and increases in average wage rates within certain workgroups. 18 Employee retirement plans expense per ASM increased 11.1 percent, due primarily to the increase in Company earnings available for profitsharing. Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 44.1 percent, due primarily to a 49.3 percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average price per gallon of jet fuel in 2000 was $.7869 compared to $.5271 in 1999, including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2000 and 1999 average jet fuel prices are net of approximately $113.5 million and $14.8 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 10.0 percent primarily because of a decrease in engine maintenance expense for the Companys 737 200 aircraft fleet as 1999 was an unusually high period for engine maintenance on these aircraft. Engine repairs for the Companys 737 200 aircraft are expensed on a time and materials basis. These engine repairs represented approximately 75 percent of the total decrease, while a decrease in airframe inspections and repairs per ASM represented the majority of the remaining decrease. The decrease in airframe inspections and repairs was due primarily to a greater amount of this work being performed internally versus 1999, when a large portion of this type of work was outsourced. Therefore, in 2000, a larger portion of the cost of these repairs was reflected in salaries and wages. Agency commissions per ASM decreased 10.0 percent, due primarily to a decrease in commissionable revenue. Approximately 31 percent of the Companys 2000 revenues were attributable to direct bookings through the Companys Internet site compared to approximately 19 percent in the prior year. The increase in Internet revenues contributed to the Companys percentage of commissionable revenues decreasing from 34.6 percent in 1999 to 29.1 percent in 2000. Aircraft rentals decreased 13.2 percent due primarily to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased. Approximately 27.3 percent of the Companys aircraft were under operating lease at December 31, 2000, compared to 30.8 percent at December 31, 1999. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM decreased 4.3 percent primarily as a result of a decrease in landing fees per ASM of 6.7 percent, partially offset by a slight increase in other rentals. Although landing fees declined on a per ASM basis, they were basically flat on a per trip basis. The growth in ASMs exceeded the trip growth due primarily to a 5.8 percent increase in stage length (the average distance per aircraft trip flown). Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 3.4 percent due primarily to Company wide cost reduction efforts. The Company also reduced its advertising expense 9.5 percent per ASM, taking advantage of our national presence, increasing brand awareness, and strong Customer demand. OTHER "Other expenses (income)" included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased 29.1 percent due primarily to the Companys issuance of $256 million of long term debt in fourth quarter 1999. Capitalized interest decreased 11.9 percent primarily as a result of lower 2000 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries compared to 1999. Interest income increased 59.0 percent due primarily to higher invested cash balances and higher rates of return. Other losses in 1999 resulted primarily from a write down associated with the consolidation of certain software development projects. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased slightly to 38.54 percent in 2000 from 38.68 percent in 1999. 19 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion in 2001 compared to $1.3 billion in 2000. The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to the deferral of approximately $186 million in tax payments until January 2002, as provided for in the Act, which more than offset the decrease in net income. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2001 compared to a net use of $59.5 million in 2000. Financing cash flows were generated from borrowings the Company made from its $475 million revolving credit facility and the issuance of $614.3 million in long term debt. These borrowings were partially offset by the redemption of $100 million unsecured notes in 2001. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these financing activities. Cash generated in 2001 was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital. During 2001, net capital expenditures were $1.0 billion, which primarily related to the purchase of 14 new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company, 11 new 737 700 aircraft the Company has effectively purchased via a special purpose trust (the Trust), and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Trust. The Companys contractual commitments consist primarily of scheduled aircraft acquisitions. As a result of the terrorist attacks, the Company was able to modify its future aircraft delivery dates through the amendment of our purchase contract with The Boeing Company and through the creation of the Trust. Through the Trust, as of December 31, 2001, Southwest will take delivery and place in service 11 new 737 700 aircraft in 2002 and eight new 737 700 aircraft in 2003. Excluding aircraft scheduled to be delivered from the Trust, as of December 31, 2001, the Company has no new 737 700 aircraft deliveries scheduled for 2002, 13 in 2003, 23 in 2004, 24 in 2005, 22 in 2006, 25 in 2007, and 6 in 2008. The Company also has a total of 87 purchase options for new 737 700 aircraft for years 2004 through 2008 and purchase rights for an additional 217 737 700s during 2007 2012. In total, Southwests Trust deliveries, firm orders, options, and purchase rights through 2012 are at 436 aircraft. The Company has the option, which must be exercised two years prior to the contractual delivery date, to substitute 737 600s or 737 800s for the 737 700s. The following table provides details regarding the Companys contractual cash obligations subsequent to December 31, 2001: CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR (IN MILLIONS) BEYOND 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 5 YEARS TOTAL Long term debt (1) $ 40 $ 130 $ 232 $ 142 $ 541 $ 291 $1,376 Short term borrowings 475 475 Operating lease commitments 290 275 243 217 185 1,590 2,800 Aircraft purchase commitments (2) 319 689 685 719 641 622 3,675 Total Contractual cash obligations $1,124 $1,094 $1,160 $1,078 $1,367 $2,503 $8,326 (1) Includes amounts classified as interest for capital lease obligations (2) Includes amounts payable to the Trust see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand at December 31, 2001 of $2.28 billion and internally generated funds. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings and modest leverage. 20 The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of $704 million of public debt securities, which it may utilize for aircraft financings in 2002 and 2003. On September 23, 1999, the Company announced its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Companys common stock. Repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2001, in aggregate, 18.3 million shares had been repurchased at a total cost of $199.2 million, of which $108.7 million was completed in 2000. No shares were repurchased in 2001. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Southwest has interest rate risk in that it holds floating rate debt instruments and has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to minimize its average jet fuel cost through execution of a documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 99 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the Companys financial derivative instruments. The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2001 were a net liability of approximately $19.4 million, which is classified in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2001 prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately $55 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2001 levels, except underlying futures prices. Airline operators are inherently capital intensive, as the vast majority of the Companys assets are expensive aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an "A" credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with Standard & Poors and Fitch ratings agencies, and a "Baa1" or equivalent credit rating with Moodys rating agency. The Companys Aircraft Secured Notes and French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these secured borrowings, the risk is somewhat mitigated by the 21 fact that the Company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these borrowings. As disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling $400 million at December 31, 2001. Also, as disclosed in Note 7, the Company issued $614.3 million in long term debt in November 2001 in the form of Pass Through Certificates (Certificates), which are secured by aircraft the Company owns. The total of the Companys long term unsecured notes represented only 6.2 percent of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2001. The unsecured long term debt currently has a weighted average maturity of 9.0 years at fixed rates averaging 7.6 percent at December 31, 2001, which is comparable to average rates prevailing over the last ten years. The Certificates bear interest at a combined weighted average rate of 5.8 percent. The Company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its unsecured long term debt or its Certificates because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which was $2.28 billion at December 31, 2001. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that generally have maturities of three months or less; therefore, the returns earned on these investments parallel closely with floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material interest rate market risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2001 would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its Aircraft Secured Notes, French Credit Agreements, and invested cash because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2001 were held constant throughout a twelve month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately $2.1 million. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt, or its Certificates. 22
