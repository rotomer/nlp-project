ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR IN REVIEW In 2002, Southwest posted a profit for the 30th consecutive year. While the Companys 2002 profitability fell short of our historical standards, this performance was remarkable given that the major airlines collectively reported losses in the billions of dollars. From a financial perspective, 2002 was one of the worst years, if not the worst, in the history of commercial aviation. It was a year that included dramatic increases in aviation insurance costs, increased passenger security costs resulting from continually evolving security laws and directives, airline industry downsizing, rising energy prices, and a recessionary airline revenue environment. However, the Companys business strategy predominantly shorthaul, high frequency, low fare, point to point, high quality Customer Service, low costs continued to serve Southwest well throughout the year. The Company has been able to combat many of these higher exogenous costs by lowering distribution costs and implementing other cost reduction measures. Throughout the difficult period beginning with the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks the Company has been profitable every quarter. During 2002, Southwest successfully met the challenge of dramatic changes in airport security. Initially, these security changes dramatically altered airport checkin procedures resulting in longer checkin times for Customers. The Company invested in additional airport facilities, new technology, changed processes and added Employees. These actions, at most airports, restored checkin times to normal durations. Specific changes to the way Customers and baggage are processed included the implementation of computer generated baggage tags to electronically track bags checked by Customers, computer generated boarding passes from multiple points in the airport, and the installation of self service RAPID CHECK IN kiosks at airports. Although the Transportation Security Administration has successfully assumed responsibility for passenger and baggage screening, and has complied with all federal security mandates as required by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, the Company is currently unable to predict what impact future mandates, if any, will have on the Companys ongoing operations and future financial performance. Although the Company did not open any new cities in 2002, it did improve its quality of service between cities already served and added 23 new 737 700 aircraft to facilitate this growth. These additions, along with the retirement of three older 737 200 aircraft, resulted in a net capacity increase of 5.5 percent, and brought the Companys all 737 fleet to 375 aircraft at the end of 2002. The Company ended 2002 serving 59 airports in 30 states. Available seat mile (ASM) capacity is expected to grow approximately four percent in 2003 with the planned net addition of 11 aircraft. The Company currently has 17 new Boeing 737 700s scheduled for delivery during the year and plans to retire six of the Companys older 737 200s. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 The Companys consolidated net income for 2002 was $241.0 million ($.30 per share, diluted), as compared to 2001 net income of $511.1 million ($.63 per share, diluted), a decrease of $270.1 million or 52.9 percent. Operating income for 2002 was $417.3 million, a decrease of $213.8 million, or 33.9 percent compared to 2001. Consolidated results for 2002 and 2001 included $48 million and $235 million, respectively, in gains that the Company recognized from grants under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Air Stabilization Act). Consolidated results for 2002 also included $36 million in additional passenger revenue from a reduction in estimated refunds and exchanges, contributing to an 12 increase in forfeited tickets included in "Air traffic liability." Consolidated results for 2001 also included special pre tax charges of approximately $48 million arising from the terrorist attacks. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that comparative analysis of results can be enhanced by excluding the impact of these special items. The following table reconciles results reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) with results adjusted for special items that are not expected to recur: (In thousands) 2002 2001 Consolidated net income, as reported $ 240,969 $ 511,147 Government grant proceeds, net * (24,796) (123,510) Passenger revenue adjustments, net * (18,103) 15,749 Special charges arising from terrorist attacks, net * 9,563 Adjusted consolidated net income, excluding special charges and unusual items (non GAAP) $ 198,070 $ 412,949 Net income per share, basic, as reported $ .31 $ .67 Government grant proceeds, net * (.03) (.16) Passenger revenue adjustments, net * (.02) .02 Special charges arising from terrorist attacks, net * .01 Adjusted net income per share, basic, excluding special charges and unusual items (non GAAP) $ .26 $ .54 Net income per share, diluted, as reported $ .30 $ .63 Government grant proceeds, net * (.03) (.15) Passenger revenue adjustments, net * (.03) .02 Special charges arising from terrorist attacks, net * .01 Adjusted net income per share, diluted, excluding special charges and unusual items (non GAAP) $ .24 $ .51 * Net of income tax and Company profitsharing effects. Following the terrorist attacks, all U.S. commercial flight operations were suspended for approximately three days. However, the Company continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses (with the exception of certain direct trip related expenditures such as fuel, landing fees, etc.). The Company canceled approximately 9,000 flights before resuming flight operations on September 14, although it did not resume its normal pre September 11 flight schedule until September 18, 2002. After operations were fully resumed, load factors and passenger yields were severely impacted, and ticket refund activity increased. The Company estimates that from September 11 through September 30, 2001, it incurred operating losses in excess of $130 million. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues decreased $33.4 million, or ..6 percent, primarily due to a $37.4 million, or .7 percent, decrease in passenger revenues. The decrease in passenger revenues was due to lower load factors (revenue passenger miles or RPMs divided by available seat miles or ASMs) attributable to the post September 11, 2001 reduction in demand for air travel, and from lower passenger yields (passenger revenue divided by RPMs) caused by a decline in full fare traffic. The Companys load factor for 2002 was 65.9 percent, compared to 68.1 percent for 2001, resulting from a capacity (ASM) increase of 5.5 percent versus an RPM increase of only 2.0 percent. Excluding special items, passenger yields for 2002 were $.1169 compared to $.1216 in 2001, a 13 decrease of 3.9 percent. In 2002, there continued to be heavy fare discounting by the Company and the airline industry in general to stimulate demand. The increase in capacity, as measured by ASMs, was due to the net addition of 20 aircraft during 2002 (net of three aircraft retirements). For the full year, the Company experienced a 2.2 percent decrease in revenue passengers carried and a 4.3 percent increase in average length of passenger haul (RPMs divided by revenue passengers carried). The Companys 2002 load factor was attained only through heavy promotional activities and aggressive revenue management. Load factors thus far in January 2003 and bookings for February and March 2003 have been satisfactory. However, we expect the air fare environment to continue to be weak, relative to pre September 11, 2001 performance, through the first quarter 2003. If current booking and revenue trends continue, first quarter 2003 unit revenues should, however, exceed first quarter 2002s unit revenue of $.0761. Consolidated freight revenues decreased $6.6 million, or 7.2 percent, primarily due to a 40.3 percent decrease in mail revenues. Following the terrorist attacks, the United States Postal Service shifted a portion of the mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers. The mail decrease more than offset an 11.4 percent increase in other freight revenues. Other revenues increased $10.5 million, or 12.4 percent, primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored First USA(R) Visa card. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2002 increased $180.4 million, or 3.7 percent, compared to the 5.5 percent increase in capacity. Operating expenses per ASM decreased 1.7 percent to $.0741, primarily due to decreases in profitsharing expense, average jet fuel costs, and commission expense. Excluding 2001 special items, operating expenses per ASM decreased .9 percent. For 2003, the Company currently expects an increase in operating expenses per ASM primarily due to higher fuel costs and salaries, wages, and benefits. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2002 and 2001 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2002 2001 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 2.89 (cents) 2.84 (cents) .05 (cents) 1.8 % Fuel and oil 1.11 1.18 (.07) (5.9) Maintenance materials and repairs .57 .61 (.04) (6.6) Agency commissions .08 .16 (.08) (50.0) Aircraft rentals .27 .29 (.02) (6.9) Landing fees and other rentals .50 .48 .02 4.2 Depreciation .52 .49 .03 6.1 Other 1.47 1.49 (.02) (1.3) Total 7.41 (cents) 7.54 (cents) (.13)(cents) (1.7) % Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 1.8 percent due to a 5.7 percent increase in salaries and wages per ASM and a 7.6 percent increase in benefits expense per ASM, partially offset by a 30.3 percent decrease in Employee retirement plans expense per ASM. The majority of the increase in salaries and wages was due to headcount additions outpacing the Companys capacity growth in several 14 operational areas, due in part to additional security requirements at airports. The remaining portion of the increase in salaries and wages per ASM was primarily due to increases in average wage rates. The increase in benefits expense per ASM was primarily due to higher health care costs. Employee retirement plans expense per ASM decreased primarily due to the decrease in Company earnings available for profitsharing. In 2002 and 2001, earnings available for profitsharing included $48 million and $235 million, respectively, from grants recognized under the Air Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also expects to experience an increase in salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in 2003 due to the continued impact of headcount additions in excess of capacity growth, higher average wage rates, and higher anticipated health care costs. The Companys Mechanics are subject to an agreement negotiated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the Teamsters), that became amendable in August 2001. The Company reached a tentative agreement with the Teamsters, which was ratified by its membership in October 2002 (on January 27, 2003, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association was certified by the National Mediation Board as the new representative of the Mechanics). The new contract, which includes the issuance of stock options, becomes amendable in August 2005. The Companys Customer Service and Reservations Agents are subject to an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) that became amendable in November 2002. The Company reached a tentative agreement with the IAM in December 2002, which was approved by IAM membership in January 2003. The new contract includes the issuance of stock options and becomes amendable in November 2008 (or 2006 at the Unions option under certain conditions as defined in the agreement). The Companys Pilots are subject to an agreement with the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA). Although the contract between Southwest and SWAPA was not amendable until September 2004, during 2002 the Company negotiated an extension with SWAPA that was ratified by its membership in August 2002. The extended contract, which includes the issuance of stock options, becomes amendable in September 2006. The Companys Ramp, Operations, and Provisioning Agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU). Although the contract between Southwest and TWU was not amendable until June 2006, during 2002 the Company negotiated a two year contract extension with TWU that was ratified by its membership in December 2002. The contract extension included the issuance of stock options. The contract with TWU now becomes amendable in June 2008 (or 2006 at the Unions option under certain conditions as defined in the agreement). The Companys Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement with the TWU that became amendable in June 2002. Southwest is currently in negotiations with the TWU for a new contract. Fuel and oil expense per ASM decreased 5.9 percent, primarily due to a 4.0 percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2002 was $.6801 compared to $.7086 in 2001, excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2002 and 2001 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $44.5 million and $79.9 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 2 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As detailed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has hedges in place for approximately 83 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in 2003, including all of its anticipated requirements for first quarter 2003. Considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, the Company is forecasting first quarter 2003 average fuel cost per gallon to be in the $.70 to $.75 range. The majority of the Companys near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts, which protect the Company in the event of rising jet fuel prices. The Company should also benefit, to a large extent, in the event of a decline in jet fuel prices. 15 Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 6.6 percent. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in airframe expense resulting from fewer outsourced heavy maintenance events versus 2001. More heavy maintenance events were performed internally in 2002, resulting in the costs associated with those events being reflected in salaries and wages. Currently, the Company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM in first quarter and full year 2003, versus 2002, due to an increase in contract rates from outside vendors as well as the number of engine inspections and repairs scheduled. The majority of the Companys engine maintenance work is outsourced. Agency commissions per ASM decreased 50.0 percent, primarily due to a change in the Companys commission rate policy. Effective October 15, 2001, the Company reduced the commission paid to travel agents from eight percent for Ticketless bookings and five percent for paper ticket bookings, to five percent (with no cap), regardless of the type of ticket sold. In addition, the mix of tickets sold through travel agents declined from 25 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2002, thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission expense. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 6.9 percent primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased. Approximately 24.0 percent of the Companys aircraft were under operating lease at December 31, 2002, compared to 25.9 percent at December 31, 2001. Based on the Companys current new aircraft delivery schedule, scheduled aircraft retirements for 2003, and financing plans, the Company expects a decline in aircraft rental expense per ASM in 2003, including the first quarter. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.2 percent primarily as a result of airport rate increases throughout the Companys system. Moreover, following the terrorist attacks, most other major airlines reduced their flight schedules due to the drop in air travel. Since Southwest did not reduce its flights, the Company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers. Depreciation expense per ASM increased 6.1 percent primarily due to growth in the Companys owned aircraft fleet. The Company received delivery of 23 new 737 700 aircraft during 2002, all of which were purchased. Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 1.3 percent despite a per ASM increase of more than 175 percent in aviation insurance costs. (The insurance cost increases were more than offset through various cost control measures implemented immediately following the prior year terrorist attacks, including reductions in personnel related expenses and office expenses: excluding insurance expense, other operating expenses per ASM decreased 8.5 percent). Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war risk coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal government then stepped in to provide supplemental third party war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers, for renewable 60 days periods, at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial rates during 2002 and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market. In November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which mandated the federal government provide third party, passenger and hull war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through August 31, 2003, and which permits such coverage to be extended by the government through December 31, 2003. The Company is unable to predict whether the government will extend this insurance coverage past August 31, 2003; whether alternative commercial insurance with comparable coverage will become available at reasonable premiums; and what impact the outcome will have on the Companys ongoing operations or future financial performance. As a result of recently concluded negotiations for 2003 commercial insurance coverage and the additional coverage provided by the government, the Company currently expects per ASM insurance costs to decrease compared to 2002 for at least the near term, including first quarter 2003. 16 OTHER "Other expenses (income)" included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased $36.2 million, or 51.8 percent compared to the prior year, due to higher debt levels. In fourth quarter 2001, the Company issued $614.3 million in long term debt in the form of Pass Through Certificates. In first quarter 2002, the Company issued $385 million in unsecured notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these two borrowings. The increase in expense caused by these borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on the Companys floating rate debt and the July 2001 redemption of $100 million of unsecured notes. Capitalized interest decreased $3.9 million, or 18.7 percent, primarily as a result of lower 2002 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries, compared to 2001. Based on the Companys current schedule of progress payments and aircraft deliveries, the Company expects progress payment balances, and corresponding capitalized interest, to increase in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest income decreased $5.6 million, or 13.2 percent, as higher invested cash balances for the year were more than offset by lower rates. Other gains in 2002 and 2001 primarily resulted from $48 million and $235 million, respectively, received as the Companys share of government grant funds under the Air Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Air Stabilization Act and grants from the government. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 38.64 percent in 2002 from 38.24 percent in 2001 primarily due to the Companys lower earnings in 2002. 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Consolidated net income for 2001 was $511.1 million ($.63 per share, diluted), as compared to 2000 net income, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, of $625.2 million ($.79 per share, diluted), a decrease of $114.1 million, or 18.2 percent. Consolidated results for 2001 included $235 million in gains that the Company recognized from grants under the Air Stabilization Act and special pre tax charges of approximately $48 million arising from the terrorist attacks (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the grant and special charges related to the terrorist attacks, net income for 2001 was $412.9 million ($.51 per share, diluted). The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for 2000 was $22.1 million, net of taxes of $14.0 million (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income and net income per share, diluted, for 2000, after the cumulative change in accounting principle, were $603.1 million and $.76, respectively. Operating income for 2001 was $631.1 million, a decrease of $390.0 million, or 38.2 percent, compared to 2000. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues decreased $94.4 million, or 1.7 percent, primarily due to a 1.6 percent decrease in passenger revenues. The decrease in passenger revenues was a direct result of the terrorist attacks. From January through August 2001, passenger revenues were higher by $314.9 million, or 8.7 percent, than the same period in 2000 primarily due to an increase in capacity, as measured by ASMs, of 11.6 percent. This capacity increase was due to the addition of 14 aircraft during 2001 (all prior to September 11) and its revenue effects were partially offset by a decrease of 1.9 percent in passenger yield. Passenger yield decreased as a result of fare discounting by the Company and the airline industry in general as the United States economy weakened throughout 2001. The Companys load factor (RPMs divided by ASMs) over this time period was 71.2 percent, compared to 71.7 percent for the same period in 2000. From September through December 2001, passenger revenues were $404.2 million, or 21.7 percent, lower than the same period of 2000. Capacity increased 4.0 percent and the Companys load factor fell to 62.0 percent, compared to 68.2 percent during the same period of 2000. Passenger yields were 17.2 percent 17 lower during this period, versus the same period in 2000, due to aggressive fare sales following the terrorist attacks. For the full year 2001, the Company experienced a 1.2 percent increase in revenue passengers carried, a 5.4 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), and a 9.0 percent increase in ASMs. The Companys load factor for 2001 was off 2.4 points, to 68.1 percent, and there was a 6.6 percent decrease in 2001 passenger yield. As a result of weak economic conditions throughout 2001, consolidated freight revenues decreased $19.5 million, or 17.6 percent. There were decreases in both the number of freight shipments and revenue per shipment. Other revenues increased $14.3 million, or 20.3 percent, primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored First USA Visa card. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2001 increased $295.6 million, or 6.4 percent, compared to the 9.0 percent increase in capacity. Operating expenses per ASM decreased 2.5 percent to $.0754, compared to $.0773 in 2000, primarily due to a decrease in average jet fuel prices. The average fuel cost per gallon in 2001 was $.7086, 10.0 percent lower than the average cost per gallon in 2000 of $.7869. Excluding fuel expense, operating expenses per ASM decreased .3 percent. Operating expenses per ASM for 2001 and 2000 were as follows: Increase Percent 2001 2000 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 2.84 (cents) 2.81 (cents) .03 (cents) 1.1 % Fuel and oil 1.18 1.34 (.16) (11.9) Maintenance materials and repairs .61 .63 (.02) (3.2) Agency commissions .16 .27 (.11) (40.7) Aircraft rentals .29 .33 (.04) (12.1) Landing fees and other rentals .48 .44 .04 9.1 Depreciation .49 .47 .02 4.3 Other 1.49 1.44 .05 3.5 Total 7.54 (cents) 7.73 (cents) (.19) (cents) (2.5) % Salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM increased 1.1 percent due to a 3.2 percent increase in salaries and wages per ASM, and a 9.8 percent increase in benefits expense per ASM, partially offset by a 17.5 percent decrease in Employee retirement plans expense per ASM. The increase in salaries and wages per ASM was primarily due to higher average wage rates within certain workgroups and increased headcount due, in part, to the increased security requirements following the September terrorist attacks. The increase in benefits expense per ASM was primarily due to higher benefits costs, primarily health care. The decrease in Employee retirement plans expense per ASM was primarily due to the decrease in Company earnings available for profitsharing. This decrease in earnings more than offset an increase in expense due to a fourth quarter amendment made to the Companys profitsharing plan. This amendment enabled the Company to take into consideration federal grants under the Act and special charges resulting from the terrorist attacks in the calculation of profitsharing. 18 Fuel and oil expense per ASM decreased 11.9 percent, primarily due to a 10.0 percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2001 was $.7086 compared to $.7869 in 2000, including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2001 and 2000 average jet fuel prices are net of approximately $79.9 million and $113.5 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 3.2 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the Companys capacity growth exceeding the increase in expense. Virtually all of the Companys 2001 capacity growth versus the prior year was accomplished with new aircraft, most of which have not yet begun to incur any meaningful repair costs. A decrease in engine expense was partially offset by an increase in expense for airframe inspections and repairs. In addition to an increase in the number of airframe inspections and repairs, the cost per event increased compared to 2000. Agency commissions per ASM decreased 40.7 percent, primarily due to a change in the Companys commission rate policy. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company reduced the commission rate paid to travel agents from ten percent to eight percent for Ticketless bookings, and from ten percent to five percent for paper ticket bookings. Effective October 15, 2001, the Company reduced the commission paid to travel agents to five percent (with no cap), regardless of the type of ticket sold. In addition, the mix of tickets sold through travel agents declined from 28 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2001, thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission expense. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 12.1 percent primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased. Approximately 25.9 percent of the Companys aircraft were under operating lease at December 31, 2001, compared to 27.3 percent at December 31, 2000. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 9.1 percent primarily as a result of the Companys expansion of facilities at several airports, including Baltimore/Washington International Airport and Chicago Midway Airport. Depreciation expense per ASM increased 4.3 percent primarily due to the growth in the Companys aircraft fleet prior to the terrorist attacks. The Company had received delivery of 14 new 737 700 aircraft prior to September 11, bringing the percentage of owned aircraft in the Companys fleet to 74.1 percent by the end of 2001 compared to 72.7 percent at the end of 2000. Other operating expenses per ASM increased 3.5 percent primarily due to a significant increase in aviation insurance costs following the terrorist attacks. The Companys insurance carriers canceled their war risk and terrorism insurance policies following the terrorist attacks and reinstated such coverage at significantly higher rates than before. OTHER "Other expenses (income)" included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense was flat compared to 2000. Following the terrorist attacks, the Company borrowed the full $475 million available under its revolving credit facility and issued $614.3 million in long term debt in the form of Pass Through Certificates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in expense caused by these borrowings was offset by a decrease in interest rates on the Companys floating rate debt and the July 2001 redemption of $100 million of unsecured notes. Capitalized interest decreased $7.0 million, or 25.3 percent, primarily as a result of lower 2001 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries as compared to 2000. The lower progress payments were due in part to the deferral of Boeing 737 aircraft firm orders and options following the terrorist attacks. Interest income increased $2.5 million, or 6.2 percent, primarily due to higher invested cash balances, partially offset by lower rates. Other gains in 2001 primarily resulted from $235 million received as the Companys share of government grant funds 19 under the Air Stabilization Act, intended to offset the Companys direct and incremental losses caused by the terrorist attacks, through the end of 2001. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Air Stabilization Act and grants from the government. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased slightly to 38.24 percent in 2001 from 38.54 percent in 2000. The decrease primarily resulted from lower effective state tax rates in 2001. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $520.2 million in 2002 compared to $1.5 billion in 2001. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to the decrease in net income and the deferral of approximately $186 million in 2001 excise tax payments until January 2002, as provided for in the Air Stabilization Act. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2002 totaled $603.1 million compared to $997.8 million in 2001. Investing activities in both years consisted primarily of payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. Of the 23 new aircraft the Company put into service during 2002, 11 were recorded (on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) through the consolidation of a special purpose trust (the Trust) during 2001. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Trust. A total of eight new 737 700 aircraft were recorded through consolidation of the Trust during 2002. The remaining four new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company in 2002 were purchased directly from Boeing. The Trust was dissolved prior to December 31, 2002. Net cash used in financing activities was $381.7 million in 2002 compared to cash generated by financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2001. Cash used in financing activities during 2002 was primarily for the repayment of the Companys $475 million revolving credit facility that the Company drew down in September 2001 and for the repayment of the Trust. These uses were partially offset by cash generated from the issuance of $385 million in unsecured notes in March 2002. Financing cash flows in 2001 were generated from borrowings the Company made from its $475 million revolving credit facility and the issuance of $614.3 million in long term debt. These borrowings were partially offset by the redemption of $100 million unsecured notes in 2001. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these financing activities. Cash generated in 2002 and in 2001 was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital. The Company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand at December 31, 2002, of $1.82 billion, internally generated funds, and a $575 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability. The Company has an available revolving credit facility from which it can borrow up to $575 million from a group of banks. One half of the facility is short term and expires on April 23, 2003 if not drawn before that date. The other one half expires on April 23, 2005. The Company expects that it will be able to renew the expiring 365 day facility for an additional 365 day period at reasonable terms. If the Company is unable to renew, the Companys available credit facility will be reduced. 20 The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion in public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it may utilize for aircraft financings in the future. In 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Companys common stock. Repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2002, in aggregate, 18.3 million shares had been repurchased at a total cost of $199.2 million, of which $108.7 million was completed in 2000. No shares were repurchased in 2001 or in 2002. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. As of February 1, 2003, Southwest is scheduled to take delivery of 17 new 737 700 aircraft from Boeing in 2003, 23 in 2004, 24 in 2005, 22 in 2006, 25 in 2007, and six in 2008. The Company also has a total of 79 purchase options for new 737 700 aircraft for years 2004 through 2008 and purchase rights for an additional 217 737 700s during 2007 2012. The Company has the option, which must be exercised two years prior to the contractual delivery date, to substitute 737 600s or 737 800s for the 737 700s. The following table aggregates the Companys expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to December 31, 2002: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS) BEYOND Contractual obligations (1) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2007 TOTAL Long term debt $ 120,797 $ 320,320 $ 637,588 $ 516,980 $ 1,595,685 Capital lease commitments (2) 17,751 41,160 26,758 52,016 137,685 Operating lease commitments 281,042 496,371 365,403 1,459,961 2,602,777 Aircraft purchase commitments 597,097 1,394,569 1,139,891 104,924 3,236,481 Total contractual cash obligations $1,016,687 $ 2,252,420 $ 2,169,640 $ 2,133,881 $ 7,572,628 (1) Does not include other commitments for the purchase of goods and services which in the aggregate are immaterial. (2) Includes amounts classified as interest. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from 21 estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold are initially deferred as "Air traffic liability." Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). "Air traffic liability" primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds, exchanges, or forfeitures of tickets sold for past travel dates. The Companys air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2002 was $412.2 million. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. Tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. "Air traffic liability" includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds, exchanges, and forfeitures for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates; however, these differences have historically not been material. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and fare sale activity. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund and exchange activity may vary from estimated amounts. Since September 2001, the Company has experienced fluctuations in estimated refunds and exchanges, and correspondingly, forfeited tickets, due to many of the factors described above. Following the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent temporary shutdown of U.S. air space, Southwest temporarily suspended its normal refund policy in order to provide the highest Service to the Companys Customers, including the refunding of nonrefundable tickets upon Customer request. As a result, the Company experienced refunds during September 2001 and through December 2001 far above historical refund levels and in excess of the Companys contractual obligations. In evaluating passenger revenue through third quarter 2001, based on these unusually high refund levels, the Company estimated that approximately $30 million of these refunds related to revenue previously recognized for estimated forfeited tickets. As a result, the Company reduced third quarter 2001 "Passenger revenue" by $30 million and restored "Air traffic liability", accordingly. Subsequent to third quarter 2001 and through second quarter 2002, the Company experienced a higher than usual mix of low fare, nonrefundable ticket sales. The Company also experienced changes in Customer travel patterns resulting from various factors including new airport security measures, concerns about further terrorist attacks, and an uncertain economy. Consequently, the Company recorded $36 million in additional passenger revenue in second quarter 2002 as Customers required fewer refunds and exchanges, resulting in more forfeited tickets. 22 While the Company believes the current estimates included in "Air traffic liability" and "Passenger revenue" are reasonable, these estimates may continue to change based on refund, exchange and forfeiture activity varying from pre September 2001 patterns. Accounting for Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately $9.46 billion of long lived assets, including $8.02 billion in flight equipment and related assets. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company has primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the Companys aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual flight hours during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense, as required by GAAP. The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133.) See "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for more information on these risk management activities. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Companys financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2002, was $157.2 million. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil and heating oil) and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities. 23 Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occur and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are realized in the financial statements. Based on these actual results once all values and prices become known, the Companys estimates have proved to be materially accurate. Furthermore, since the majority of the Companys hedges settle within 12 to 24 months from the time the Company enters into the contract for the derivative financial instrument, the estimates being made are relatively short term. Estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the period to period change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from a period to period change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge will result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of charges or income, even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under SFAS 133. See Note 2 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on SFAS 133 and the Companys fuel hedging activities. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some statements in this Form 10 K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the Companys behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) which are not historical facts may be "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements include statements about Southwests estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements. Southwest uses the words "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "forecasts", "may," "will," "should" and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or the Companys present expectations. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: Items directly linked to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, such as the adverse impact of new airline and airport security directives on the Companys costs and Customer demand for travel, changes in the Transportation Security Administrations scope for managing U.S. airport security, the availability and cost of war risk and other aviation insurance, including the federal governments provision of third party war risk coverage, and the possibility of additional incidents that could cause the public to question the safety and or efficiency of air travel. War or other military actions by the U.S. or others. Competitive factors, such as fare sales and capacity decisions by the Company and its competitors, changes in competitors flight schedules, mergers and acquisitions, codesharing programs, and airline bankruptcies. 24 General economic conditions, which could adversely affect the demand for travel in general and consumer ticket purchasing habits, as well as decisions by major freight Customers on how they allocate freight deliveries among different types of carriers. Factors that could affect the Companys ability to control its costs, such as the results of Employee labor contract negotiations, Employee hiring and retention rates, costs for health care, the largely unpredictable prices of jet fuel, crude oil, and heating oil, the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, changes in the Companys overall fuel hedging strategy, capacity decisions by the Company and its competitors, unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements, changes in commission policy, availability of capital markets, and future financing decisions made by the Company. Disruptions to operations due to adverse weather conditions and air traffic control related constraints. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Companys forward looking statements, which represent the Companys views only as of the date this report is filed. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Southwest has interest rate risk in that it holds floating rate debt instruments and has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to minimize its average jet fuel cost through execution of a documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 97 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Fuel hedging. The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2002, were a net asset of $157.2 million. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $112.8 million, is classified as "Fuel hedge contracts" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $44.4 million, is included in "Other assets." The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2002, prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately $135 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2002 levels, except underlying futures prices. 25 Financial market risk. Airline operators are inherently capital intensive as the vast majority of the Companys assets are expensive aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an "A" credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with Standard & Poors and Fitch ratings agencies, and a "Baa1" credit rating with Moodys rating agency. The Companys Aircraft Secured Notes and French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these secured borrowings, the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. As disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling $785 million at December 31, 2002. In addition, as disclosed in Note 7, the Company had outstanding long term fixed rate debt totaling $585.7 million in the form of Pass Through Certificates (Certificates), which are secured by aircraft the Company owns. The total of the Companys long term unsecured notes represented 11.7 percent of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2002. The unsecured long term debt currently has a weighted average maturity of 8.2 years at fixed rates averaging 7.3 percent at December 31, 2002, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The Certificates bear interest at a combined weighted average rate of 5.5 percent. The Company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its unsecured long term debt or its Certificates because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which was $1.82 billion at December 31, 2002. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money markets, and investment grade commercial paper that generally have maturities of three months or less; therefore, the returns earned on these investments parallel closely with floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2002, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its Aircraft Secured Notes, French Credit Agreements, and invested cash because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2002, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately $1.3 million. Using these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt, or its Certificates. The Company is also subject to various types of liquidity and financing risk included in agreements with financial institutions that process credit card transactions on behalf of the Company, the Companys revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements. Such risks included the 26 Company maintaining minimum credit ratings, the Companys assets (for secured debt) maintaining minimum fair values, and the Company achieving minimum covenant ratios with regard to its available or outstanding debt agreements. The Company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of December 31, 2002. However, if conditions change and the Company failed to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep the agreements intact as written. 27
