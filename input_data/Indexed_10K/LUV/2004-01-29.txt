ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR IN REVIEW In 2003, Southwest posted a profit for the 31st consecutive year. The Company also extended its streak of consecutive quarterly profits to 51 periods in fourth quarter 2003. Both of these achievements are unsurpassed in the airline industry. For the third consecutive year, the airline industry as a whole suffered a net loss and many of the larger airlines underwent or continued massive efforts to restructure their business, gain wage concessions from their employees, and slash costs in efforts to avoid bankruptcy or emerge from bankruptcy. For the Company, although profitability levels have not returned to those achieved prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, profits increased considerably versus 2002, even excluding the impact of government grants received in both years. Although the process has been gradual, revenue trends had shown improvement prior to the Iraq war, and have steadily improved since major hostilities in Iraq ended in May 2003. However, air traffic remains depressed compared to pre September 11, 2001, levels, particularly business demand. Unit revenues continue to run below pre September 11, 2001, levels by more than 10 percent and the percentage of Customers traveling on full fares remains down from historical levels. The Company does not anticipate a complete recovery in revenues until the economy fully recovers and there is an upturn in business travel. The Companys business strategy did not waver in 2003. Southwest remained committed to providing predominantly shorthaul flights, high frequency service, low fares, point to point flying, and high quality Customer Service, all while keeping costs low. The Company also continued to complement this strategy by adding longer haul flights, including transcontinental service. The Company continued to respond to the many security changes imposed since the terrorist attacks and find ways to improve Customer convenience and the airport experience. The Company has automated and significantly streamlined the ticketing and boarding process with computer generated bag tags, automated boarding passes, self service boarding pass kiosks, and electronic boarding pass readers at the gate. The Company also has made technological advancements, including the addition of functionality to its website at www.southwest.com, and has continued to enhance its fleet interiors with a new look, including comfortable leather seats. The Company did not open any new cities in 2003, although it continued to improve its quality of service between cities already served. The Company recently announced that it would begin new service to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in May 2004, which will represent the Companys 60th airport and 31st state to which it flies. During 2003, the Company added 17 new 737 700 aircraft to its fleet and retired four older 737 200 aircraft, resulting in a net capacity increase of 4.2 percent. This brought the Companys all 737 fleet to 388 aircraft at the end of 2003. During 2003, the Company made announcements that are expected to benefit the Companys overall cost structure in 2004 and beyond. The Company announced it would add blended winglets to its fleet of 737 700 aircraft. The addition of these wing enhancements, which began to be retrofitted on existing aircraft in fourth quarter 2003 and are expected to take place through early 2005, will extend the range of these aircraft, save fuel, lower engine maintenance costs, and reduce takeoff noise. New aircraft are expected to arrive with winglets already installed beginning in August 2004. In October 2003, the Company announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective December 15, 2003, consistent with virtually all other U.S. airlines. This change in policy is expected 14 Table of Contents to save the Company approximately $40 million in 2004. In November 2003, the Company also announced the consolidation of its nine Reservations Centers into six, effective February 28, 2004. This decision was made in response to the established shift to the internet as a preferred way of booking travel. The Companys website, www.southwest.com, is now accountable for more than half of passenger revenues, and, as a consequence, demand for phone contact has dramatically decreased. The Company estimates the costs associated with this decision, approximately $20 million, will be recognized primarily in first quarter 2004. These costs are primarily related to Employee relocation expenses and severance packages. The Company estimates that future annual operating cost savings related to this decision will exceed the costs incurred. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company also expects to benefit from efficiencies achieved at airports through our effort to improve the Customer experience in ticketing and boarding. Available seat mile (ASM) capacity currently is expected to grow in the 7 to 8 percent range in 2004 with the planned net addition of 29 aircraft. The Company currently has 47 new Boeing 737700s scheduled for delivery during the year and plans to retire 18 of the Companys older 737 200s. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 The Companys consolidated net income for 2003 was $442 million ($.54 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $241 million ($.30 per share, diluted), an increase of $201 million or 83.4 percent. Operating income for 2003 was $483 million, an increase of $66 million, or 15.8 percent compared to 2002. As disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, results for 2003 included $271 million as Other gains from the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act) and results for 2002 included $48 million as Other gains from grants under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Stabilization Act). The Company believes that excluding the impact of these special items will enhance comparative analysis of results. The grants were made to stabilize and support the airline industry as a result of the devastating effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2003 war with Iraq. Neither of these grants was indicative of the Companys operating performance for these respective periods, nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. The following table reconciles results reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for 2003 and 2002 with results excluding the impact of the government grants received: 15 Table of Contents (in millions, except per share amounts) 2003 2002 Operating expenses, as reported $ 5,454 $ 5,105 Profitsharing impact of Stabilization Act grant (7 ) Profitsharing impact of Wartime Act grant (40 ) Operating expenses, excluding impact of government grants $ 5,414 $ 5,098 Operating income, as reported $ 483 $ 417 Profitsharing impact of Stabilization Act grant 7 Profitsharing impact of Wartime Act grant 40 Operating income, excluding impact of government grants $ 523 $ 424 Net income, as reported $ 442 $ 241 Stabilization Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (25 ) Wartime Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (144 ) Net income, excluding government grants $ 298 $ 216 Net income per share, diluted, as reported $ .54 $ .30 Stabilization Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (.03 ) Wartime Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (.18 ) Net income per share, diluted, excluding government grants $ .36 $ .27 Excluding the governments grants received in both years, consolidated net income for 2003 was $298 million ($.36 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $216 million ($.27 per share, diluted), an increase of $82 million, or 38.0 percent. The increase was primarily due to overall higher demand for air travel in 2003, vacation travel in particular. Operating income for 2003 was $523 million, an increase of $99 million, or 23.3 percent compared to 2002. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased $415 million, or 7.5 percent, primarily due to a $400 million, or 7.5 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a 5.6 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) flown. Although the Company saw a disruption in revenue and bookings due to the threat of war and from the subsequent conflict between the United States and Iraq during the first half of 2003, demand improved following the war. The increase in revenue passenger miles primarily was due to a 4.2 percent increase in added capacity, as measured by available seat miles or ASMs. This was achieved through the Companys net addition of 13 aircraft during 2003 (net of four aircraft retirements). The Companys improved load factor for 2003 (RPMs divided by ASMs) was 66.8 percent, compared to 65.9 percent for 2002. The improved 2003 load factor is still well below pre September 11, 2001, annual levels. Passenger yields for 2003 (passenger revenue divided by RPMs) were $.1197 compared to $.1177 in 2002, an increase of 1.7 percent, due to less heavy fare discounting in 2003 by the Company and the airline industry in general. As the economy recovers and demand for business travel increases, the Companys operating revenue yields per ASM (unit revenues) gradually continue to improve. Although the first half of January 2004 showed modest unit revenue growth, bookings suggest that Januarys load factor could fall below January 2003s load factor of 58.0 percent. Consolidated freight revenues increased $9 million, or 10.6 percent, primarily due to an increase in freight and cargo units shipped. Other revenues increased $6 million, or 6.3 percent, primarily due to an increase 16 Table of Contents in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Bank One (formerly First USA) Visa card. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2003 increased $349 million, or 6.8 percent, compared to the 4.2 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2003 and 2002 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2003 2002 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.10 2.89 .21 7.3 % Fuel and oil 1.16 1.11 .05 4.5 Maintenance materials and repairs .60 .57 .03 5.3 Agency commissions .07 .08 (.01 ) (12.5 ) Aircraft rentals .25 .27 (.02 ) (7.4 ) Landing fees and other rentals .52 .50 .02 4.0 Depreciation .53 .52 .01 1.9 Other 1.37 1.47 (.10 ) (6.8 ) Total 7.60 7.41 .19 2.6 % Operating expenses per ASM increased 2.6 percent to $.0760, primarily due to increases in salaries, profitsharing, and jet fuel prices, after hedging gains. For first quarter 2004, excluding costs associated with the Companys reservations center consolidation, the Company currently expects an increase in operating expenses per ASM compared to first quarter 2003 primarily due to higher salaries, jet fuel prices, and airport costs. Based on the Companys aggressive efforts to mitigate these cost pressures, unit costs should begin to decline in the second half of 2004. For the year 2004, the Companys goal is to, at least, keep unit costs flat with 2003. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 7.3 percent. Approximately 60 percent of the increase was due to an increase in salaries and wages per ASM, primarily from increases in average wage rates. The majority of the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in Employee retirement plans expense per ASM, primarily from the increase in 2003 earnings and resulting profitsharing. The Company also expects to experience an increase in salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in 2004 due, in part, to restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the Companys reservations centers. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement with the TWU that became amendable in June 2002. In September 2003, the Company and the TWU requested the assistance of the National Mediation Board in the negotiations for a new contract; however, as of the end of 2003, a mutual agreement had not been reached. Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 4.5 percent, primarily due to a 6.3 percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2003 was 72.3 cents compared to 68.0 cents in 2002, excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2003 and 2002 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $171 million and $45 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 2 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As detailed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 17 Table of Contents Company has hedges in place for over 80 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in 2004 with a combination of derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at about $24 per barrel, including approximately 82 percent of its anticipated requirements for first quarter 2004. Considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, the Company is forecasting first quarter 2004 average fuel cost per gallon to be in the 75 to 80 cent range. The majority of the Companys near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts, which protect the Company in the event of rising jet fuel prices and allow the Company to benefit in the event of declining prices. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 5.3 percent primarily due to an increase in engine maintenance. The Company outsources all of its engine maintenance work. Approximately half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for 737 300 and 500 aircraft subject to a long term maintenance contract, which is based on a contract rate charged per hour flown. The majority of the increase in engine expense for these aircraft in 2003 was due to an increase in the contract rate per hour flown, predicated on increased engine maintenance events. The other half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for 737 700 aircraft, which is based on a time and materials basis. Expense for these aircraft engines increased because of an increase in repairs for these aircraft engines. Currently, the Company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM in first quarter 2004, versus 2003, due to the number of engine repairs scheduled. Agency commissions per ASM decreased 12.5 percent, primarily due to a decline in commissionable revenues. The percentage of commissionable revenues decreased from approximately 20 percent in 2002 to approximately 16 percent in 2003. Approximately 54 percent of passenger revenues in 2003 were derived through the Companys web site at www.southwest.com versus 49 percent in 2002. In October 2003, the Company announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective December 15, 2003. This change in policy is expected to save the Company approximately $40 million in 2004. Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation expense per ASM were both impacted by a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 7.4 percent while depreciation expense per ASM increased 1.9 percent. The Company owns all 17 of the aircraft it put into service during 2003. This, along with the retirement of three owned and one leased aircraft, has increased the Companys percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to 77 percent at December 31, 2003, from 76 percent at December 31, 2002. Based on the Companys scheduled 2004 capacity increases and aircraft financing plans, the Company expects a decline in aircraft rental expense per ASM in 2004. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.0 percent primarily as a result of higher space rental rates throughout the Companys system. During 2003, many other major airlines reduced their flight capacity at airports served by the Company. Since Southwest did not reduce its flights, the Company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers. Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 6.8 percent. Approximately 70 percent of the decrease was due to lower aviation insurance costs. Following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war risk coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal government stepped in to provide supplemental third party war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers for renewable 60 days periods, at substantially lower premiums than then prevailing commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market. In November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which mandated the federal government provide third party, passenger, and hull war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through August 31, 2003, and which permitted such coverage to be extended by the government through December 31, 2003. The Emergency Wartime 18 Table of Contents Supplemental Appropriations Act (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) extended the governments mandate to provide war risk insurance until August 31, 2004, and permits extensions until December 31, 2004. As a result of more coverage from government insurance programs and a more stable aviation insurance market, the Company was able to negotiate lower 2003 aviation insurance premiums than 2002. However, aviation insurance remains substantially higher than before September 11, 2001. The majority of the remaining decrease in other operating expenses per ASM was due to reductions in security costs from the transition of airport security to the federal government, and decreases in advertising and personnel related expenses. As a result of recently concluded negotiations for 2004 commercial insurance coverage and the additional coverage provided by the government, the Company currently expects other operating expenses per ASM to decrease again, in 2004. OTHER Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased $15 million, or 14.2 percent, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower effective interest rates. The Company executed two interest rate swaps in second quarter 2003 to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to a lower floating rate. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2012 and $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due November 1, 2006. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys hedging activities. Excluding the effect of any new debt offerings the Company may execute during 2004, the Company expects a decrease in interest expense compared to 2003, due to the full year effect of the 2003 interest rate swaps, the October 2003 redemption of its $100 million senior unsecured 8 3/4% Notes, and the scheduled redemption of the Companys $175 million Aircraft Secured Notes on its due date in fourth quarter 2004. Capitalized interest increased $16 million, or 94.1 percent, primarily as a result of higher 2003 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries, compared to 2002. Based on the Companys current schedule of progress payments and aircraft deliveries, the Company expects progress payment balances, and corresponding capitalized interest, to increase in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest income decreased $13 million, or 35.1 percent, primarily due to a decrease in rates earned on short term investments. Other gains in 2003 and 2002 primarily resulted from government grants of $271 million and $48 million, respectively, received pursuant to the Wartime and the Stabilization Acts. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these Acts. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 37.60 percent in 2003 from 38.64 percent in 2002 due to higher Company earnings in 2003 and lower effective state income tax rates. 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 The Companys consolidated net income for 2002 was $241 million ($.30 per share, diluted), as compared to 2001 net income of $511 million ($.63 per share, diluted), a decrease of $270 million or 52.8 percent. Approximately 43 percent of this decrease was due to the decrease in government grants that the Company recognized under the Stabilization Act. In 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized $48 million (pretax) and $235 million (pretax) in government grants under the Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remainder of the decrease primarily was due to the full year impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Company and the airline industry. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, all U.S. commercial flight operations were suspended for approximately three days. However, the Company continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses (with the exception of certain direct trip related expenditures such as fuel, landing fees, etc.). The Company canceled approximately 9,000 flights before resuming flight operations on September 14. After operations were fully resumed, load factors and passenger yields were severely depressed, and ticket refund activity increased. In addition, operating expenses in areas 19 Table of Contents such as aviation insurance and security related expenses were much higher than before. From January 2001 through the end of August 2001, the Company had earned approximately $707 million in operating income. However, for September 2001, it incurred operating losses of $113 million, and for fourth quarter 2001, operating income was $37 million. For the full year 2002, operating income was $417 million, a decrease of $214 million, or 33.9 percent compared to 2001 due to the full year impact the terrorist attacks had on airline industry revenue performance. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated 2002 operating revenues decreased $33 million from 2001, or .6 percent, primarily due to a $38 million, or .7 percent, decrease in passenger revenues. The decrease in passenger revenues was primarily due to lower load factors attributable to the post September 11, 2001 reduction in demand for air travel. The Companys load factor for 2002 was 65.9 percent, compared to 68.1 percent for 2001, resulting from a capacity (ASM) increase of 5.5 percent versus a traffic (RPM) increase of only 2.0 percent. The increase in ASMs was due to the net addition of 20 aircraft during 2002 (net of three aircraft retirements). Consolidated freight revenues decreased $6 million, or 6.6 percent, primarily due to a 40.3 percent decrease in mail revenues. Following the terrorist attacks, the United States Postal Service shifted a significant portion of the mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers. The mail decrease more than offset an 11.4 percent increase in other freight revenues. Other revenues increased $11 million, or 12.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Bank One Visa card. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2002 increased $181 million, or 3.7 percent, compared to the 5.5 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2002 and 2001 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2002 2001 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 2.89 2.84 .05 1.8 % Fuel and oil 1.11 1.18 (.07 ) (5.9 ) Maintenance materials and repairs .57 .61 (.04 ) (6.6 ) Agency commissions .08 .16 (.08 ) (50.0 ) Aircraft rentals .27 .29 (.02 ) (6.9 ) Landing fees and other rentals .50 .48 .02 4.2 Depreciation .52 .49 .03 6.1 Other 1.47 1.49 (.02 ) (1.3 ) Total 7.41 7.54 (.13) (1.7 )% Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 1.8 percent due to a 5.7 percent increase in salaries and wages per ASM and a 7.6 percent increase in benefits expense per ASM, mostly offset by a 30.3 percent decrease in Employee retirement plans expense per ASM. The majority of the increase in salaries and wages was due to headcount additions outpacing the Companys capacity growth in several operational areas, due in part to additional security requirements at airports. The remaining portion of the increase in salaries and wages per ASM primarily was due to higher average wage rates. 20 Table of Contents The increase in benefits expense per ASM primarily was due to higher health care costs. Employee retirement plans expense per ASM decreased due to lower Company earnings available for profitsharing. In 2002 and 2001, earnings available for profitsharing included $48 million and $235 million, respectively, from grants recognized under the Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fuel and oil expense per ASM decreased 5.9 percent, primarily due to a 4.0 percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2002 was 68.0 cents compared to 70.9 cents in 2001, excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2002 and 2001 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $45 million and $80 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 6.6 percent. This decrease primarily was due to a decrease in airframe expense resulting from fewer outsourced heavy maintenance events versus 2001. More heavy maintenance events were performed internally in 2002, resulting in the labor costs associated with those events being reflected in salaries and wages. Agency commissions per ASM decreased 50.0 percent, primarily due to a change in the Companys commission rate policy. Effective October 15, 2001, the Company reduced the commission paid to travel agents from eight percent for Ticketless bookings and five percent for paper ticket bookings, to five percent, regardless of the type of ticket sold. In addition, the mix of tickets sold through travel agents declined from 25 percent of total revenues in 2001 to 20 percent in 2002, thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission expense. Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation expense per ASM were both impacted by a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 6.9 percent while depreciation expense per ASM increased 6.1 percent. The Company owns all 23 of the aircraft it put into service during 2002. This, along with the retirement of one owned and two leased aircraft in 2002, increased the Companys percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to 76 percent at December 31, 2002, from 74 percent at December 31, 2001. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.2 percent primarily as a result of airport rate increases throughout the Companys system. Moreover, following the terrorist attacks, most other major airlines reduced their flight schedules due to the drop in air travel. Since Southwest did not reduce its flights, the Company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers. Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 1.3 percent despite a per ASM increase of more than 175 percent in aviation insurance costs. The insurance cost increases were more than offset through various cost control measures implemented immediately following the prior year terrorist attacks, including reductions in personnel related expenses and office expenses. Excluding insurance expense, other operating expenses per ASM decreased 8.5 percent. Following the terrorist attacks, commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war risk coverage available to commercial carriers. The federal government then stepped in to provide supplemental third party war risk insurance coverage to commercial airlines, for renewable 60 days periods, at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial rates during 2002 and for levels of coverage not available at that time in the commercial market. OTHER Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased $36 million, or 51.4 percent, compared to the prior year, due to higher debt levels. In fourth quarter 2001, the Company issued $614 million 21 Table of Contents in long term debt in the form of Pass Through Certificates. In first quarter 2002, the Company issued $385 million in unsecured notes. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these two borrowings. The increase in expense caused by these borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on the Companys floating rate debt and the July 2001 redemption of $100 million of unsecured notes. Capitalized interest decreased $4 million, or 19.0 percent, primarily as a result of lower 2002 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries, compared to 2001. Interest income decreased $6 million, or 14.0 percent, as higher invested cash balances for the year were more than offset by lower rates. Other gains in 2002 and 2001 primarily resulted from $48 million and $235 million, respectively, received as the Companys share of government grants under the Stabilization Act. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Stabilization Act. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 38.64 percent in 2002 from 38.24 percent in 2001, primarily due to the Companys lower earnings in 2002. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2003 compared to $520 million in 2002. For the Company, operating cash inflows are primarily derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day in which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows are primarily related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. For 2003, the increase in operating cash flows primarily was due to higher net income, largely attributable to the $271 million government grant from the Wartime Act. Also contributing to the increase in operating cash flows was an increase in accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts and other receivables. The increase in accrued liabilities primarily was due to an increase in accrued profitsharing from higher 2003 earnings available for profitsharing. The decrease in accounts and other receivables was primarily due to the 2003 collection of a $51 million tax refund related to the 2002 tax year. Cash generated in 2003 and in 2002 was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2003 totaled $1.2 billion compared to $603 million in 2002. Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. Although the Company received fewer new aircraft in 2003 (17 new 737 700s) versus 2002 (23 new 737 700s), there was a substantial increase in progress payments for future deliveries compared to the prior year. The increase in progress payments primarily was related to aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 2005. During 2003, the Company accelerated the delivery for several aircraft from future years into 2004, and exercised options for several 2004 and 2005 deliveries. These decisions resulted in an acceleration of progress payments to the manufacturer related to the aircraft. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash used in financing activities was $48 million in 2003 compared to $382 million in 2002. Cash used in financing activities during 2003 was primarily for the redemption of its $100 million senior unsecured 8 % Notes originally issued in 1991. This was mostly offset by proceeds of $93 million from the exercise of Employee stock options. Cash used in financing activities in 2002 was primarily for the repayment of the Companys $475 million revolving credit facility that the Company drew down in September 2001 and for the repayment of a special purpose trust (Trust) created in 2001. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Trust. These uses were partially offset by cash generated from the issuance of $385 million in unsecured notes in March 2002. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these financing activities. 22 Table of Contents The Company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand at December 31, 2003, of $1.9 billion, internally generated funds, and a $575 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability. The Company has two fully available unsecured revolving credit facilities from which it can borrow up to $575 million from a group of banks. One of the facilities, for half of the total amount, was renewed for an additional year during April 2003. This facility now expires in April 2004. The other facility, for half of the amount, expires in April 2005. The Company expects that it will be able to renew the expiring 364 day facility for an additional 364 day period at reasonable terms. If the Company is unable to renew, the Companys available credit facility will be reduced. The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion in public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it may utilize for aircraft financings in the future. The Company currently expects that a portion of these securities will be issued in 2004. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. Along with the receipt of 17 new 737 700 aircraft from Boeing in 2003, the Company exercised several options for delivery in 2004 and 2005 and accelerated the delivery dates for several aircraft into 2004 from future years. The Company also entered into an agreement to lease a new Boeing 737 700 from a third party beginning in 2004. The following table details the Companys current firm orders, options, and purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft: As of December 31, 2003 Firm Options* 2004** 47 2005 28 6 2006 22 12 2007 25 29 2008 6 45 2009 2012 177 Total 128 269 * Includes purchase rights ** Includes one leased aircraft The Company has the option to substitute 737 600s or 800s for the 700s. This option is applicable to aircraft ordered from the manufacturer and must be exercised two years prior to the contractual delivery date. 23 Table of Contents The following table details information on the 388 aircraft in the Companys fleet as of December 31, 2003: Average Number Number Number 737 Type Seats Age (Yrs) of Aircraft Owned Leased 200 122 21.2 23 21 2 300 137 12.6 194 110 84 500 122 12.7 25 16 9 700 137 3.3 146 145 1 TOTALS 9.6 388 292 96 The Company has engaged in off balance sheet arrangements in the leasing of aircraft. The leasing of aircraft provides flexibility to the Company by allowing for capacity and fleet growth, without the substantial cash outlay necessary to purchase new aircraft. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating the aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. As shown above and as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company operates 96 aircraft that it has leased from third parties, of which 89 are operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating lease are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft are shown below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003: Obligations by period (in millions) 2005 2007 Beyond Contractual obligations 2004 2006 2008 2008 Total Long term debt (1) $ 196 $ 658 $ 110 $ 511 $ 1,475 Capital lease commitments (2) 18 38 29 39 124 Operating lease commitments 283 492 392 1,328 2,495 Aircraft purchase commitments (3) 1,177 1,421 619 3,217 Other purchase commitments 90 133 5 228 Total contractual obligations $ 1,764 $ 2,742 $ 1,155 $ 1,878 $ 7,539 (1) Includes current maturities, but excludes amounts associated with interest rate swap agreements (2) Includes amounts classified as interest (3) Firm orders from the manufacturer The Company currently expects that it will issue a portion of its $1.0 billion in public debt securities and pass through certificates from its outstanding shelf registrations during 2004, in order to fulfill some of its obligations as noted above. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2003. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. In January 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys common stock, utilizing present and anticipated proceeds from the exercise of Employee 24 Table of Contents stock options. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The Companys air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2003 was $462 million. Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns, as noted above, can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund and exchange activity may vary from estimated amounts. Furthermore, the Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported 25 Table of Contents based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Following September 2001 and through 2002, the Company experienced fluctuations in estimated refunds and exchanges, and correspondingly, forfeited tickets, due to many of the factors described above. Following the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent temporary shutdown of U.S. air space, Southwest temporarily suspended its normal refund policy in order to provide the highest Service to the Companys Customers, including the refunding of nonrefundable tickets upon Customer request. As a result, the Company experienced refunds during September 2001 and through December 2001 far above historical refund levels and in excess of the Companys contractual obligations. In evaluating passenger revenue through third quarter 2001, based on these unusually high refund levels, the Company estimated that approximately $30 million of these refunds related to revenue previously recognized for estimated forfeited tickets. As a result, the Company reduced third quarter 2001 Passenger revenue by $30 million and restored Air traffic liability, accordingly. Subsequent to third quarter 2001 and through second quarter 2002, the Company experienced a higher than historical mix of discount, nonrefundable ticket sales. The Company also experienced changes in Customer travel patterns resulting from various factors, including new airport security measures, concerns about further terrorist attacks, and an uncertain economy. Consequently, the Company recorded $36 million in additional passenger revenue in second quarter 2002 as Customers required fewer refunds and exchanges, resulting in more forfeited tickets. During 2003, refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity returned to more historic, pre September 11, 2001, patterns. Accounting for Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $10.6 billion of long lived assets, including $8.6 billion in flight equipment and related assets. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: Estimated Estimated Useful Life Residual value Aircraft and engines 20 to 25 years 15 %* Aircraft parts Fleet life 4 % Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10 % Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term 0 % * The Companys remaining 737 200s, due to be retired by first quarter 2005, have residual values of 2% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company has primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the Companys aircraft. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (a cycle is one take off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys 26 Table of Contents maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense, as required by GAAP. When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). See Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities and see Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on SFAS 133, the Companys fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Companys financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, was $251 million. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily were a combination of collars, purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil and heating oil) and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. Based on these actual results once all values and prices become known, the Companys estimates have proved to be materially accurate. Furthermore, since the majority of the Companys hedges settle within 12 to 24 months from the time the Company enters into the contract for the derivative financial instrument, the estimates being made are relatively short term. 27 Table of Contents Estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the period to period change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from a period to period change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge will result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of charges or income, even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under SFAS 133. SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements including the documentation of a Company hedging strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis, and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is executed by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes (crude oil and heating oil). The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements. During second quarter 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due November 1, 2006. Under the first interest rate swap agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional amount of $385 million until March 1, 2012. Under the second agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.496% every six months on a notional amount of $375 million until November 1, 2006. The Companys interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. Under the shortcut method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2003, was a liability of approximately $18 million. This amount is recorded in Other deferred liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some statements in this Form 10 K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the Companys behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) which are not historical facts, may be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements include statements about Southwests estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements. Southwest uses the words anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, forecasts, may, will, should, and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve 28 Table of Contents risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or the Companys present expectations. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: Items directly linked to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, such as the adverse impact of new airline and airport security directives on the Companys costs and Customer demand for travel, changes in the Transportation Security Administrations scope for managing U.S. airport security, the availability and cost of war risk and other aviation insurance, including the federal governments provision of third party war risk coverage, and the possibility of additional incidents that could cause the public to question the safety and or efficiency of air travel. War or other military actions by the U.S. or others. Competitive factors, such as fare sales and capacity decisions by the Company and its competitors, changes in competitors flight schedules, mergers and acquisitions, codesharing programs, and airline bankruptcies. General economic conditions, which could adversely affect the demand for travel in general and consumer ticket purchasing habits, as well as decisions by major freight Customers on how they allocate freight deliveries among different types of carriers. Factors that could affect the Companys ability to control its costs, such as the results of Employee labor contract negotiations, Employee hiring and retention rates, costs for health care, the largely unpredictable prices of jet fuel, crude oil, and heating oil, the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, changes in the Companys overall fuel hedging strategy, capacity decisions by the Company and its competitors, unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements, changes in commission policy, availability of capital markets, future financing decisions made by the Company, and reliance on single suppliers for both the Companys aircraft and its aircraft engines. Disruptions to operations due to adverse weather conditions and air traffic control related constraints. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Companys forward looking statements, which represent the Companys views only as of the date this report is filed. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 96 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 29 Table of Contents Companys accounting for its hedging program and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Fuel hedging. The Company utilizes its fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume 1.2 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2004. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $12 million per year. The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2003, were net assets of $251 million. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $164 million, is classified as Fuel hedge contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $87 million, is included in Other assets. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2003, prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately $125 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2003, levels, except underlying futures prices. Financial market risk. Airline operators are inherently capital intensive as the vast majority of the Companys assets are expensive aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an A credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with Standard Poors and Fitch ratings agencies, and a Baa1 credit rating with Moodys rating agency. The Companys Aircraft Secured Notes and French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due November 1, 2006. Due to these transactions, the Company considers these debts to also be at floating rates. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the Aircraft Secured Notes and French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. Excluding the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling $300 million at December 31, 2003. These senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of 9.3 years at fixed rates averaging 7.75 percent at December 31, 2003, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The fixed rate portion of the Companys pass through certificates consists of its Class A certificates and Class B certificates, which totaled $193 million at December 31, 2003. These Class A and Class B certificates had a weighted average maturity of 2.3 years at fixed rates averaging 5.58 percent at December 31, 2003. The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $964 million, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 4.6 years at floating rates averaging 1.47 percent at December 31, 2003. In total, 30 Table of Contents the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 6.5 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2003. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money markets, investment grade commercial paper, and other highly rated financial instruments. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2003, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash, and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2003, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $1 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance, short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2003, an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement, the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements. Covenants included the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and minimum asset fair values. The Company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of December 31, 2003. However, if conditions change and the Company failed to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written. 31 Table of Contents
