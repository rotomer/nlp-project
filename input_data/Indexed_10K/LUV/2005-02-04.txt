ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR IN REVIEW In 2004, Southwest posted a profit for its 32nd consecutive year, and 55th consecutive quarter. Southwests 2004 profit of $313 million exceeded our 2003 profit, excluding the impact of a 2003 federal government grant, by 5.0 percent. These achievements were accomplished despite record high energy prices, and aggressive industry growth, which contributed to the continuing weak airline revenue environment. For the fourth consecutive year, the airline industry as a whole suffered a substantial net loss. As a result, certain carriers filed for bankruptcy protection, and many carriers underwent or continued massive efforts to restructure their business, gain wage concessions from their employees, and slash costs. To maintain its low cost competitive advantage, the Company continued its Company wide efforts to improve its cost structure. As a result, the Company increased productivity at all Employee levels, and improved the overall efficiency of its operations. In November 2003, the Company announced the consolidation of its Reservations centers from nine to six, effective February 2004. Of the 1,900 Employees affected, approximately 1,000 did not elect to move to one of the Companys remaining reservations locations. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In second quarter 2004, the Company offered an early out option to substantially all Employees, primarily in an effort to alleviate overstaffing in certain areas of the Company. The overstaffing primarily was the result of slower passenger growth; changes in Customer buying habits and boarding processes; and the federalization of airport security. Due to these and other productivity efforts, the Companys headcount per aircraft decreased from 85 at December 31, 2003, to 74 at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has added blended winglets to approximately 92 percent of its fleet of 737 700 aircraft. The addition of these wing enhancements, which are expected to be completed for all 737 700 aircraft in early 2005, extend the range of these aircraft, save fuel, lower potential engine maintenance costs, and reduce takeoff noise. All new 737 700 aircraft now arrive from Boeing with winglets already installed. The Company expects annual fuel consumption savings of approximately 3 percent for each aircraft outfitted with the winglets. The Company also phased out commissions on travel agency sales in 2004, consistent with virtually all other U.S. airlines. This change in policy saved the Company approximately $50 million in 2004. Demand for air travel was stronger in 2004, albeit at depressed fare levels. Southwest had Company record load factors for every month from March to July. For full year 2004, Southwests load factor was 69.5 percent, which was up 2.7 points from 2003, and represented the second highest load factor in the Companys history. Passenger revenue yield per RPM, on the other hand, was down 1.8 percent compared to 2003. Overall, unit revenues continue to run well below pre September 11, 2001, levels, and the percentage of Customers traveling on full fares remains down from historical levels. The Company does not anticipate a complete recovery in revenues until full fare business travel fully recovers or there is a rationalization of industry capacity. The Company believes that, despite the difficult airline industry environment, it is well positioned to grow and remain profitable in 2005. The Companys low cost competitive advantage, protective fuel hedging position, and excellent Employees have allowed Southwest to react quickly to market opportunities. The Company added Philadelphia to its route system in May 2004, and ramped up growth at Chicago Midway Airport. In fourth quarter 2004, Southwest was selected as the winning bidder at a bankruptcy court approved auction for certain ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA) assets, which ensures the Company can continue to add low fare service in Chicago. As part of the transaction, which closed in December 2004, Southwest agreed to pay $40 million for certain ATA assets, consisting of the leasehold rights to six ATA Chicago Midway Airport gates 13 Table of Contents and the leasehold rights to an aircraft maintenance hangar at Midway. Southwest and ATA have also agreed to a codeshare arrangement, which was approved by the Department of Transportation in January 2005, in which each carrier will exchange passengers on select routes at Midway. The Company believes this agreement could result in additional revenues of $25 million to $50 million, annually. In addition, Southwest has provided ATA with debtor in possession financing and made other financial commitments to ATA. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. During 2004, the Company added 47 new 737 700 aircraft to its fleet and retired 18 older 737 200 aircraft, resulting in a net available seat mile (ASM) capacity increase of 7.1 percent. This brought the Companys all 737 fleet to 417 aircraft at the end of 2004. The demand for Southwests low fare, high quality Customer Service flights in Philadelphia has made this city the Companys most aggressive new city start ever. Also, in January 2005, the Company announced that Pittsburgh would become the 60th city the Company flies to, with daily service beginning May 2005. ASM capacity currently is expected to grow approximately 10 percent in 2005 with the planned net addition of 29 aircraft. The Company currently has 34 new Boeing 737700s scheduled for delivery during the year and will retire all five of its remaining 737 200s in January 2005. 14 Table of Contents Results of Operation 2004 Compared With 2003 The Companys consolidated net income for 2004 was $313 million ($.38 per share, diluted), as compared to 2003 net income of $442 million ($.54 per share, diluted), a decrease of $129 million or 29.2 percent. Operating income for 2004 was $554 million, an increase of $71 million, or 14.7 percent compared to 2003. As disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, results for 2003 included $271 million as Other gains from the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act). The Company believes that excluding the impact of this special item will enhance comparative analysis of results. The grant was made to stabilize and support the airline industry as a result of the 2003 war with Iraq. Financial results including the grant were not indicative of the Companys operating performance for 2003, nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. There were no special items in 2004. The following table reconciles and compares results reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for 2004 and 2003 with results excluding the impact of the government grant received in 2003: (in millions, except per share and per ASM amounts) 2004 2003 Operating expenses, as reported $ 5,976 $ 5,454 Profitsharing impact of government grant (40 ) Operating expenses, excluding grant impact $ 5,976 $ 5,414 Operating expenses per ASM, as reported $ .0777 $ .0760 Profitsharing impact of government grant (.0006 ) Operating expenses per ASM, excluding grant impact $ .0777 $ .0754 Operating income, as reported $ 554 $ 483 Profitsharing impact of government grant 40 Operating income, excluding impact of government grants $ 554 $ 523 Net income, as reported $ 313 $ 442 Government grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (144 ) Net income, excluding government grants $ 313 $ 298 Net income per share, diluted, as reported $ .38 $ .54 Government grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (.18 ) Net income per share, diluted, excluding government grants $ .38 $ .36 Excluding the government grant received, consolidated net income for 2004 increased $15 million, or 5.0 percent, compared to 2003 net income of $298 million. The increase primarily was due to higher revenues from the Companys fleet growth and addition of capacity, which slightly exceeded higher costs. Excluding the impact of the 2003 government grant, operating income increased $31 million, or 5.9 percent, compared to 2003. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased $593 million, or 10.0 percent, primarily due to a $539 million, or 9.4 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to an 11.4 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) flown, driven by the Companys growth and a 2.7 point increase in the Companys load factor compared to 2003. The Company increased available seat miles (ASMs) by 7.1 percent compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the net addition of 29 aircraft during 2004 (47 new aircraft, net of 18 aircraft retirements). The Companys load factor for 2004 (RPMs divided by ASMs) was 69.5 percent, compared to 66.8 percent for 2003. Although this represented a strong load factor performance for the Company, passenger yields for 2004 (passenger revenue 15 Table of Contents divided by RPMs) remained under considerable pressure due to significant capacity increases by a large majority of carriers. Passenger yields for 2004 declined to $.1176, compared to $.1197 in 2003, a decrease of 1.8 percent, because of heavy fare discounting arising as a result of the glut in industry seats available. The Company believes the pressure on passenger yields will continue into the foreseeable future, barring a dramatic decrease in industry capacity or a strong upturn in full fare travel. However, continued industry discounting will most likely keep load factors at elevated levels compared to historical averages. The Companys January 2005 load factor was 58.8 percent, which was 2.6 points higher than January 2004s load factor of 56.2 percent. However, we expect January 2005s passenger unit revenues to fall below the year ago performance. Consolidated freight revenues increased $23 million, or 24.5 percent. Approximately 70 percent of the increase was due to an increase in freight and cargo revenues, primarily due to more units shipped. The remaining 30 percent of the increase was due to higher mail revenues, as the U.S. Postal Service shifted more business to commercial carriers. Other revenues increased $31 million, or 30.4 percent, primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase (formerly Bank One) Visa card. The Company expects continued year over year increases in both freight and other revenues in first quarter 2005, in comparison to first quarter 2004; however, not at the rate experienced in 2004. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2004 increased $522 million, or 9.6 percent, compared to the 7.1 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2004 and 2003 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2004 2003 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.18 3.10 .08 2.6 % Fuel and oil 1.30 1.16 .14 12.1 Maintenance materials and repairs .60 .60 Agency commissions .07 (.07 ) (100.0 ) Aircraft rentals .23 .25 (.02 ) (8.0 ) Landing fees and other rentals .53 .52 .01 1.9 Depreciation and amortization .56 .53 .03 5.7 Other 1.37 1.37 Total 7.77 7.60 .17 2.2 % Operating expenses per ASM increased 2.2 percent to $.0777, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of hedging gains, and an increase in salaries, wages, and benefits. These increases were partially offset by the Companys elimination of commissions paid to travel agents, which was effective December 15, 2003. For first quarter 2005, the Company currently expects operating expenses per ASM, excluding fuel, to decline from first quarter 2004s unit costs, excluding fuel, of 6.57 cents, primarily due to year over year decreases in salaries, wages, and benefits and maintenance costs per ASM. The expected decrease in salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM will primarily be due to $13 million in severance and relocation costs associated with the Companys reservations center consolidation in first quarter 2004. For the year 2005, the Company expects unit costs, excluding fuel, to be lower than 2004. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 2.6 percent, inclusive of $40 million in additional expense from the profitsharing impact of the 2003 government grant. Excluding the profitsharing impact of 16 Table of Contents the 2003 government grant, approximately 70 percent of the increase per ASM was due to higher salaries expense, primarily from higher average wage rates, and 25 percent was due to higher benefits costs, primarily health care and workers compensation. For fourth quarter 2004 versus 2003, salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM decreased 1.0 percent, as the Company benefited from increased labor productivity. This increase in productivity was driven primarily by headcount reductions from the Companys reservations center consolidation and early out program during 2004, and slowed hiring. The Company expects to experience a decrease in salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2005 due, in part, to severance and other charges related to the consolidation of the Companys reservations centers in first quarter 2004, along with increased productivity. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During second quarter 2004, the Company and the Transport Workers Union Local 556 reached a tentative labor agreement (contract) for the Companys Flight Attendants, which includes both pay increases and the issuance of stock options. During July 2004, a majority of the Companys Flight Attendants ratified the contract, which is for the period from June 1, 2002, to May 31, 2008. During third quarter 2004, the Company and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, representing the Companys Mechanics, agreed to extend the date the current agreement becomes amendable to August 2008. The extension includes both pay raises and the issuance of stock options, and was ratified by a majority of the Companys Mechanics. During third quarter 2004, the Company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing the Companys Flight Simulator Technicians, agreed to extend the date the current agreement becomes amendable to November 2011. The extension includes both pay raises and the issuance of stock options, and was ratified by a majority of the Companys Simulator Technicians. Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 12.1 percent, primarily due to a 14.5 percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon, net of hedging gains. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2004 was 82.8 cents compared to 72.3 cents in 2003, excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2004 and 2003 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $455 million and $171 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to better the fuel efficiency of its aircraft. These steps primarily included the addition of blended winglets to 177 of the Companys 737 700 aircraft as of December 31, 2004, and the upgrade of certain engine components on many aircraft. The Company estimates that these and other efficiency gains saved the Company approximately $28 million, at 2004 average unhedged market jet fuel prices. As detailed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has hedges in place for approximately 85 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in 2005 with a combination of derivative instruments that effectively cap prices at a crude oil equivalent price of approximately $26 per barrel. Considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, the Company is forecasting first quarter 2005 average fuel cost per gallon, net of expected hedging gains, to exceed fourth quarter 2004s average price per gallon of 89.1 cents. The majority of the Companys near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts, which protect the Company in the event of rising jet fuel prices and allow the Company to benefit in the event of declining prices. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM were flat compared to 2003. Currently, the Company expects a decrease in maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM in first quarter 2005, versus first quarter 2004, due to a decrease in the number of scheduled maintenance events. Agency commissions per ASM decreased to zero, due to the elimination of commissions paid to travel agents, effective December 15, 2003. The Company records commission expense in the period of travel, not the period of sale. Consequently, the Company recognized small amounts of commission expense in 2004 as all pre 17 Table of Contents December 15, 2003 commissionable sales were flown, primarily in the first quarter of 2004. For the full year 2003, approximately 16 percent of passenger revenues were commissionable, based on the Companys previous policy of paying a 5 percent commission to travel agents. For 2004, approximately 13 percent of revenues were derived through travel agents, 59 percent through the Companys web site at southwest.com, and the remaining portion through the Companys Reservations Centers. For fourth quarter 2004, approximately 63 percent of passenger revenues were derived from southwest.com. Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation and amortization expense per ASM were both impacted by a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 8.0 percent while depreciation and amortization expense per ASM increased 5.7 percent. Of the 47 aircraft the Company acquired during 2004, 46 are owned and one is on operating lease. This, along with the retirement of 16 owned and two leased aircraft, has increased the Companys percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to 79 percent at December 31, 2004, from 77 percent at December 31, 2003. Based on the Companys scheduled 2005 capacity increases and aircraft financing plans, the Company expects a year over year decline in aircraft rental expense per ASM in 2005. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 1.9 percent primarily due to the Companys expansion of gate and counter space at several airports across our system. Other operating expenses per ASM were flat compared to 2003. An increase in expense from higher fuel taxes as a result of the substantial increase in fuel prices was mostly offset by lower advertising expense. OTHER Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased by $3 million, or 3.3 percent, primarily due to the Companys October 2003 redemption of $100 million of senior unsecured 8 3/4% Notes originally issued in 1991. This decrease was partially offset by the Companys September 2004 issuance of $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes and the fourth quarter 2004 issuance of $112 million in floating rate financing. Concurrently with the September 2004 issuance, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert this fixed rate debt to floating rate. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the interest rate swap agreement. Excluding the effect of any new debt offerings the Company may execute during 2005, the Company expects an increase in interest expense compared to 2004, due to the full year effect of the $350 million Notes, the fourth quarter 2004 issuance of $112 million in floating rate financing, and higher expected floating interest rates. These increases are expected to more than offset a decrease in expense from the March 2005 redemption of $100 million 8% senior unsecured notes. Capitalized interest increased $6 million, or 18.2 percent, primarily as a result of higher 2004 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries, compared to 2003. Interest income decreased $3 million, or 12.5 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average invested cash balances. Other gains in 2003 primarily resulted from the government grant of $271 million received pursuant to the Wartime Act. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the grant. Other losses in 2004 primarily include amounts recorded in accordance with SFAS 133. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys hedging activities. During 2004, the Company recognized approximately $24 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the Companys measurements of hedge effectiveness and $13 million in expense related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 35.94 percent in 2004 from 37.60 percent in 2003. Approximately half of the rate reduction primarily was due to lower effective state income tax rates. The remainder of the decrease primarily was due to a reduction in estimated liabilities for prior year taxes as a result of discussions with taxing authorities. The Company expects its 2005 effective tax rate to be approximately 38 percent. 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 The Companys consolidated net income for 2003 was $442 million ($.54 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $241 million ($.30 per share, diluted), an increase of 18 Table of Contents $201 million, or 83.4 percent. Operating income for 2003 was $483 million, an increase of $66 million, or 15.8 percent compared to 2002. As disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, results for 2003 included $271 million as Other gains from the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (Wartime Act) and results for 2002 included $48 million as Other gains from grants under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Stabilization Act). The Company believes that excluding the impact of these special items will enhance comparative analysis of results. The grants were made to stabilize and support the airline industry as a result of the devastating effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2003 war with Iraq. Neither of these grants were indicative of the Companys operating performance for these respective periods, nor should they be considered in developing trend analysis for future periods. The following table reconciles results reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for 2003 with results excluding the impact of the government grant received in that period: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2003 2002 Operating expenses, as reported $ 5,454 $ 5,105 Profitsharing impact of Stabilization Act grant (7 ) Profitsharing impact of Wartime Act grant (40 ) Operating expenses, excluding impact of government grants $ 5,414 $ 5,098 Operating income, as reported $ 483 $ 417 Profitsharing impact of Stabilization Act grant 7 Profitsharing impact of Wartime Act grant 40 Operating income, excluding impact of government grants $ 523 $ 424 Net income, as reported $ 442 $ 241 Stabilization Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (25 ) Wartime Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (144 ) Net income, excluding government grants $ 298 $ 216 Net income per share, diluted, as reported $ .54 $ .30 Stabilization Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (.03 ) Wartime Act grant, net of income taxes and profitsharing (.18 ) Net income per share, diluted, excluding government grants $ .36 $ .27 Excluding the governments grants received in both years, consolidated net income for 2003 was $298 million ($.36 per share, diluted), as compared to 2002 net income of $216 million ($.27 per share, diluted), an increase of $82 million, or 38.0 percent. The increase primarily was due to overall higher demand for air travel in 2003, especially vacation travel. Operating income for 2003 was $523 million, an increase of $99 million, or 23.3 percent, compared to 2002. OPERATING REVENUES Consolidated operating revenues increased $415 million, or 7.5 percent, primarily due to a $400 million, or 7.5 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to a 5.6 percent increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) flown. Although the Company saw a disruption in revenue and bookings due to the threat of war and from the subsequent conflict between the United States and Iraq during first half 2003, demand improved following the war. The increase in revenue passenger miles primarily was due to a 4.2 percent increase in added capacity, as measured by available seat miles or ASMs. This was achieved through the Companys net addition of 13 aircraft during 2003 (net of four aircraft retirements). The Companys improved load factor for 2003 was 66.8 percent, compared to 65.9 percent for 2002. Passenger yields for 2003 were $.1197 compared to $.1177 in 19 Table of Contents 2002, an increase of 1.7 percent, due to less fare discounting in 2003 by the Company and the airline industry, in general. Consolidated freight revenues increased $9 million, or 10.6 percent, primarily due to an increase in freight and cargo units shipped. Other revenues increased $6 million, or 6.3 percent, primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase (formerly Bank One) Visa card. OPERATING EXPENSES Consolidated operating expenses for 2003 increased $349 million, or 6.8 percent, compared to the 4.2 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2003 and 2002 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2003 2002 (decrease) change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.10 2.89 .21 7.3 % Fuel and oil 1.16 1.11 .05 4.5 Maintenance materials and repairs .60 .57 .03 5.3 Agency commissions .07 .08 (.01 ) (12.5 ) Aircraft rentals .25 .27 (.02 ) (7.4 ) Landing fees and other rentals .52 .50 .02 4.0 Depreciation and amortization .53 .52 .01 1.9 Other 1.37 1.47 (.10 ) (6.8 ) Total 7.60 7.41 .19 2.6 % Operating expenses per ASM increased 2.6 percent to $.0760, primarily due to increases in salaries, profitsharing, and jet fuel prices, after hedging gains. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased 7.3 percent. Approximately 60 percent of the increase was due to an increase in salaries and wages per ASM, primarily from increases in average wage rates. The majority of the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in Employee retirement plans expense per ASM, primarily from the increase in 2003 earnings and resulting profitsharing. Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 4.5 percent, primarily due to a 6.3 percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2003 was 72.3 cents compared to 68.0 cents in 2002, excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities. The Companys 2003 and 2002 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $171 million and $45 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 5.3 percent primarily due to an increase in engine maintenance. The Company outsources all of its heavy engine maintenance work. Approximately half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft subject to a long term maintenance contract, which is based on a contract rate charged per hour flown. The majority of the increase in engine expense for these aircraft in 2003 was due to an increase in the contract rate per hour flown, predicated on increased engine maintenance events. The other half of the increase in engine maintenance expense was for 737 700 aircraft, which is based on a time and materials basis. Expense for these aircraft engines increased due to the growing number of this type of aircraft in the Companys fleet. Agency commissions per ASM decreased 12.5 percent, primarily due to a decline in commissionable revenues. The percentage of commissionable revenues decreased from approximately 20 percent in 2002 to 20 Table of Contents approximately 16 percent in 2003. Approximately 54 percent of passenger revenues in 2003 were derived through the Companys web site at southwest.com versus 49 percent in 2002. In October 2003, the Company announced it would no longer pay commissions on travel agency sales effective December 15, 2003. Aircraft rentals per ASM and depreciation and amortization expense per ASM were both impacted by a higher percentage of the aircraft fleet being owned. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 7.4 percent while depreciation and amortization expense per ASM increased 1.9 percent. The Company owns all 17 of the aircraft it put into service during 2003. This, along with the retirement of three owned and one leased aircraft, increased the Companys percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to 77 percent at December 31, 2003, from 76 percent at December 31, 2002. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM increased 4.0 percent primarily as a result of higher space rental rates throughout the Companys system. During 2003, many other major airlines reduced their flight capacity at airports served by the Company. Since Southwest did not reduce its flights, the Company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers. Other operating expenses per ASM decreased 6.8 percent. Approximately 70 percent of the decrease was due to lower aviation insurance costs. As a result of more coverage from government insurance programs and a more stable aviation insurance market, the Company was able to negotiate lower 2003 aviation insurance premiums compared to 2002. However, aviation insurance for 2003 was substantially higher than before September 11, 2001. The majority of the remaining decrease in other operating expenses per ASM was due to reductions in security costs from the transition of airport security to the federal government, and decreases in advertising and personnel related expenses. OTHER Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased $15 million, or 14.2 percent, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower effective interest rates. The Company executed two interest rate swaps in second quarter 2003 to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to a lower floating rate. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2012 and $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due November 1, 2006. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys hedging activities. Capitalized interest increased $16 million, or 94.1 percent, primarily as a result of higher 2003 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries, compared to 2002. Interest income decreased $13 million, or 35.1 percent, primarily due to a decrease in rates earned on short term investments. Other gains in 2003 and 2002 primarily resulted from government grants of $271 million and $48 million, respectively, received pursuant to the Wartime and the Stabilization Acts. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these Acts. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 37.60 percent in 2003 from 38.64 percent in 2002 due to higher Company earnings in 2003 and lower effective state income tax rates. 21 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2004 compared to $1.3 billion in 2003. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. For 2004, the decrease in operating cash flows primarily was due to lower net income in 2004, largely attributable to the $271 million government grant received in 2003, and an increase in Accounts and other receivables. The increase in Accounts and other receivables was primarily due to the $40 million debtor in possession loan made to ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA), in December 2004 (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and an increase in receivables from fuel hedge counterparties from higher hedging gains recorded in fourth quarter 2004 versus fourth quarter 2003. These were partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities, primarily from higher counterparty deposits associated with the Companys fuel hedging program. For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Cash generated in 2004 and in 2003 primarily was used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2004 totaled $1.9 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2003. Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 46 new 737 700 aircraft in 2004 (and leased one additional 737 700) versus the purchase of 17 new 737 700s in 2003. However, progress payments for future deliveries were substantially higher in 2003 than 2004, due to the fact that, during 2003, the Company accelerated the delivery for several aircraft from future years into 2004, and exercised options for several 2004 and 2005 deliveries. These decisions resulted in an acceleration of progress payments to the manufacturer related to the aircraft. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, in 2004, the Company made an initial payment of $34 million for certain ATA assets, and provided ATA with $40 million in debtor in possession financing. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net cash provided by financing activities was $133 million in 2004, primarily from the issuance of $520 million in long term debt. The majority of the debt issuance was the $350 million senior unsecured notes issued in September 2004, and the fourth quarter 2004 issuance of $112 million in floating rate financing. The largest cash outflows in financing activities were from the Companys repurchase of $246 million of its common stock during 2004, and the redemption of long term debt, primarily the $175 million Aircraft Secured Notes that came due in November 2004. For 2003, net cash used in financing activities was $48 million. Cash used primarily was for the redemption of its $100 million senior unsecured 8 3/4% Notes originally issued in 1991. This was mostly offset by proceeds of $93 million from the exercise of Employee stock options. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt. The Company has various options available to meet its 2005 capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand at December 31, 2004, of $1.3 billion, internally generated funds, and a $575 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability. The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $650 million in public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it may utilize for aircraft financings or other purposes in the future. The Company currently expects that a portion of these securities will be issued in 2005, primarily to replace debt that is coming due and to fund current fleet growth plans. 22 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. Along with the receipt of 47 new 737 700 aircraft in 2004 (one of which is leased), the Company exercised its remaining options for aircraft to be delivered in 2005, and several more options for aircraft to be delivered in 2006. The following table details the Companys current firm orders, options, and purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft: Current Schedule Firm Options* 2005 34 2006 26 8 2007 25 29 2008 6 45 2009 2012 177 Total 91 259 * Includes purchase rights The Company has the option to substitute 737 600s or 800s for the 700s. This option is applicable to aircraft ordered from the manufacturer and must be exercised two years prior to the contractual delivery date. The Company has engaged in off balance sheet arrangements in the leasing of aircraft. The leasing of aircraft provides flexibility to the Company effectively as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating the aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. As shown above and as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company operates 95 aircraft that it has leased from third parties, of which 88 are operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating lease are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft are shown below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004: Obligations by period (in millions) 2006 2008 Beyond Contractual obligations 2005 2007 2009 2009 Total Long term debt (1) $ 129 $ 707 $ 25 $ 936 $ 1,797 Capital lease commitments (2) 24 26 26 26 102 Operating lease commitments 343 535 430 1,369 2,677 Aircraft purchase commitments (3) 920 1,232 105 2,257 Other purchase commitments 120 78 15 127 340 Total contractual obligations $ 1,536 $ 2,578 $ 601 $ 2,458 $ 7,173 (1) Includes current maturities, but excludes amounts associated with interest rate swap agreements (2) Includes amounts classified as interest (3) Firm orders from the manufacturer 23 Table of Contents The Company currently expects that it will issue a portion of its $650 million in outstanding shelf registrations for public debt securities during 2005. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In January 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys common stock, utilizing present and anticipated proceeds from the exercise of Employee stock options. Repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. During 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 17.0 million of its common shares for a total of approximately $246 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The Companys Air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2004 was $529 million, compared to $462 million as of December 31, 2003. Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns, as noted, can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The 24 Table of Contents Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. Furthermore, the Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting for Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $11.9 billion (at cost) of long lived assets, including $10.0 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 329 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2004, which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 88 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2004, are on operating lease. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: Estimated Estimated Useful Life Residual value Aircraft and engines 20 to 25 years 2% 15 % Aircraft parts Fleet life 4 % Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10 % Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term 0 % In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the Companys aircraft. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required by GAAP. When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairments related to its 25 Table of Contents existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). See Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on SFAS 133, the Companys fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2004, the Company was a party to over 300 financial derivative instruments, related to fuel hedging, for the years 2005 through 2009. The fair value of the Companys fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004, was $796 million, compared to $251 million at December 31, 2003. The large increase in fair value primarily was due to the dramatic increase in energy prices throughout 2004, and the Companys addition of derivative instruments to increase its hedge positions in future years. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically, as was evident during 2004, based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. Based on these actual results once all values and prices become known, the Companys estimates have proved to be materially accurate. Estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of charges or income, even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a 26 Table of Contents future period. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under SFAS 133, in relation to the fair value of the underlying financial derivative instruments. SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements including the documentation of a Company hedging strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis, and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is executed by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes (crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline). The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements. The primary objective for the Companys use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities. Concurrently, the Companys interest rate hedges are also intended to take advantage of market conditions in which short term rates are significantly lower than the fixed longer term rates on the Companys long term debt. During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due 2006. The floating rate paid under each agreement sets in arrears. Under the first agreement, the Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional amount of $385 million until 2012. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 is estimated to be 4.490 percent based on actual and forward rates at December 31, 2004. Under the second agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.496% every six months on a notional amount of $375 million until 2006. Based on actual and forward rates at December 31, 2004, the average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 is estimated to be 4.695 percent. During 2004, the Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement relating to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.25% every six months on a notional amount of $350 million until 2014. The floating rate is set in advance. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2004 was 2.814 percent. The Companys interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. Under the shortcut method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and, thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2004, was a liability of approximately $16 million. This amount is recorded in Other deferred liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments, and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. 27 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some statements in this Form 10 K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the Companys behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) which are not historical facts, may be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements include statements about Southwests estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements. Southwest uses the words anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, forecasts, may, will, should, and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or the Companys present expectations. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: Items directly linked to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, such as the adverse impact of new airline and airport security directives on the Companys costs and Customer demand for travel, changes in the Transportation Security Administrations scope for managing U.S. airport security, the availability and cost of war risk and other aviation insurance, including the federal governments provision of third party war risk coverage, and the possibility of additional incidents that could cause the public to question the safety and or efficiency of air travel. War or other military actions by the U.S. or others. Competitive factors, such as fare sales and capacity decisions by the Company and its competitors, changes in competitors flight schedules, mergers and acquisitions, codesharing programs, and airline bankruptcies. General economic conditions, which could adversely affect the demand for travel in general and consumer ticket purchasing habits, as well as decisions by major freight Customers on how they allocate freight deliveries among different types of carriers. Factors that could affect the Companys ability to control its costs, such as the results of Employee labor contract negotiations, Employee hiring and retention rates, costs for health care, the largely unpredictable prices of jet fuel, crude oil, and heating oil, the continued effectiveness of the Companys fuel hedges, changes in the Companys overall fuel hedging strategy, capacity decisions by the Company and its competitors, unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements, changes in commission policy, availability of capital markets, future financing decisions made by the Company, and reliance on single suppliers for both the Companys aircraft and its aircraft engines. Disruptions to operations due to adverse weather conditions and air traffic control related constraints. Internal failures of technology or large scale external interruptions in technology infrastructure, such as power, telecommunications, or the internet. Risks involved with the Companys acquisition of certain assets from ATA Airlines, Inc. (ATA), including the ability to efficiently utilize the rights to the leases acquired, and the collectibility of loans made to ATA. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Companys forward looking statements, which represent the Companys views only as of the date this report is filed. The Company undertakes no 28 Table of Contents obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 95 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Fuel hedging. The Company utilizes its fuel hedges, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume 1.3 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2005. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $13 million per year. The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2004, were net assets of $796 million. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $428 million, is classified as Fuel hedge contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $368 million, is included in Other assets. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2004, prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately $300 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2004, levels, except underlying futures prices. Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. At December 31, 2004, the Company had agreements with seven counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31, 2004, the Company held $330 million in cash collateral deposits, and another $150 million in U.S. Treasury Bills, under these bilateral collateral provisions. These collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally eliminate, the credit risk associated with the Companys hedging program. The cash deposits are included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments 29 Table of Contents of Liabilities, the U.S. Treasury Bills, supplied as non cash collateral by counterparties, are not reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Financial market risk. The vast majority of the Companys assets are expensive aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an A credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with Standard Poors and Fitch ratings agencies, and a Baa1 credit rating with Moodys rating agency. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. This includes the Companys $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due 2006, and the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. Excluding the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes, and the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling $300 million at December 31, 2004. These senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years at fixed rates averaging 7.75 percent at December 31, 2004, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The fixed rate portion of the Companys pass through certificates consists of its Class A certificates and Class B certificates, which totaled $174 million at December 31, 2004. These Class A and Class B certificates had a weighted average maturity of 1.5 years at fixed rates averaging 5.63 percent at December 31, 2004. The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $1.2 billion, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 7.1 years at floating rates averaging 4.42 percent at December 31, 2004. In total, the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 5.2 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2004. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money markets, investment grade commercial paper, and other highly rated financial instruments. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2004, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash, and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2004, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $2 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance, short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004, an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. 30 Table of Contents The Company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement, the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements. Covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings. For the revolving credit facility, the Company shall also maintain, at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 1.25 to 1.0. The Company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of December 31, 2004. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written. 31 Table of Contents
