Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Year in Review Southwest recorded a profit of $499 million in 2006, an increase of $15 million, or 3.1 percent, compared to the Companys 2005 net income of $484 million. Although the airline industry as a whole in 2006 was expected to report its first collective profit since 2000, Southwests string of consecutive profitable years has now reached 34, and the Company also extended its number of consecutive profitable quarters to 63, both of which are unmatched in the industry. Southwests 2006 operating income was $934 million, an increase of $209 million, or 28.8 percent, compared to 2005. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by strong revenues, especially during the first half of the year, and effective cost control measures. As a result of the extensive restructuring in the U.S. airline industry in 2004 and 2005, several carriers reduced domestic capacity, resulting in fare increases and higher load factors for many airlines in 2006. In fact, Southwests 2006 load factor of 73.1 percent was a company record. The Company modestly raised its fares over the course of the year, resulting in an increase in passenger revenue yield per RPM (passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles) of 6.9 percent compared to 2005. Unit revenue (total revenue divided by available seat miles) also increased a healthy 10.2 percent compared to 2005 levels, as a result of the higher load factor and higher RPM yield. The Companys 2006 CASM (cost per available seat mile) was basically flat compared to 2005, excluding fuel. This was primarily a result of the Companys continued focus on controlling non fuel costs and attempting to offset wage rate and benefit increases through productivity and efficiency improvements. In addition, the Companys headcount per aircraft at December 31, 2006 was 68, which was an improvement versus a year ago level of 71. Furthermore, from the end of 2003 to the end of 2006, the Companys headcount per aircraft decreased 20.0 percent, as the number of Employees remained virtually flat despite the net addition of 93 aircraft during that three year period. Including fuel expense, 2006 CASM increased 9.3 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to the 48.5 percent increase in the Companys fuel cost per gallon, including the effects of hedging. Significant events for Southwest and or the airline industry during 2006 included: * The Wright Amendment Reform Act of 2006 immediately lifted through ticketing restrictions, so that Customers could purchase a single one stop ticket between Dallas Love Field and any Southwest destination beyond the nine Wright Amendment states (to which nonstop Love Field service is permitted), and will eventually eliminate substantially all restrictions associated with the Wright Amendment in 2014. This Act also reduced the maximum number of available gates for commercial air service at Love Field from 32 to 20, of which the Company will ultimately lease 16. Dallas Love Field is a significant destination for Southwest as well as the location of the Companys headquarters. * The Department of Transportation announced that for August, September, and October 2006, Southwest carried the most passengers of any U.S. airline. * Southwest began service to two new destinations Denver, Colorado and Washington Dulles in northern Virginia. * During 2006, Southwest was authorized by its Board of Directors to repurchase a total of $1.0 billion of its outstanding common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company repurchased 49.1 million shares for $800 million. * The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) mandated new security measures as a result of a terrorist plot uncovered by authorities in London. The stringent new rules, mostly regarding the types of liquid items that can be carried onboard the aircraft, had a negative impact on air travel beginning in mid August, especially on shorthaul routes and with business travelers. The Company estimated it lost more than $40 million in passenger revenue in August and September related to the security threat and these new restrictions. * The price of jet fuel continued to be a significant factor for Southwest and other airlines. Despite the Companys industry leading fuel hedging program, which resulted in cash savings of $675 million in 2006, the Companys jet fuel cost per gallon still increased by 48.5 percent compared to 2005. * The Company added 36 737 700 aircraft in 2006, bringing its fleet to 481 Boeing 737s at December 31, 2006. As the Company experienced in 2006, it must continue to overcome higher jet fuel prices to grow profits. Based on current and projected energy prices for 2007 and expected growth plans, the Company 16 Table of Contents believes expenditures for jet fuel could increase between $400 million and $500 million compared to 2006, even including the effects of fuel derivative contracts the Company has in place as of January 2007. The Companys fuel derivative contracts in place for 2007 provide protection for nearly 95 percent of the Companys expected jet fuel consumption at an average price of approximately $50 per barrel of crude oil. The Company once again hopes to overcome the impact of higher anticipated 2007 fuel prices and other cost pressures through improved revenues and continued focus on non fuel costs. As Southwest moves into 2007, the Company believes its low cost competitive advantage, protective fuel hedging position, excellent Employees, and strong balance sheet will allow Southwest to respond quickly to potential industry consolidation and to favorable market opportunities. The Company plans to add 37 new 737 700 aircraft to its fleet in 2007, resulting in a net available seat mile (ASM) capacity increase of approximately eight percent. Based on these deliveries, the Companys fleet will total 518 737s by the end of 2007. Results of Operations 2006 Compared With 2005 The Companys consolidated net income for 2006 was $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted), as compared to 2005 net income of $484 million ($.60 per share, diluted), an increase of $15 million, or 3.1 percent. Operating income for 2006 was $934 million, an increase of $209 million, or 28.8 percent, compared to 2005. The 2006 increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenues from the Companys fleet growth, improved load factors, and higher fares, which more than offset a significant increase in the cost of jet fuel. The Company believes operating income provides a better indication of the Companys financial performance for both 2006 and 2005 than does net income. This is due to the fact that, generally, certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods, are included in Other (gains) losses, which is below the operating income line, in both periods. In 2006, these adjustments, which are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives and are included in Other (gains) losses, totaled net losses of $101 million. For 2005, these adjustments totaled net gains of $110 million. Operating Revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, or 19.8 percent, primarily due to a $1.5 billion, or 20.2 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in capacity, an increase in RPM yield, and an increase in load factor. Approximately 45 percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the Companys 8.8 percent increase in available seat miles compared to 2005. The Company increased available seat miles as a result of the addition of 36 aircraft (all 737 700 aircraft). Approximately 35 percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the 6.9 percent increase in passenger yields. Average passenger fares increased 11.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to less fare discounting because of the strong demand for air travel coupled with the availability of fewer seats as a result of industrywide domestic capacity reductions. The remainder of the passenger revenue increase primarily was due to the 2.4 point increase in the Companys load factor compared to 2005. The 73.1 percent load factor for 2006 represented the highest annual load factor in the Companys history. The airline revenue environment changed significantly from the first half of 2006 to the second half of the year. The Company believes this was due to both reduced demand related to domestic economic factors, as well as the effects of the increased carryon baggage restrictions put in place following the terrorist plot uncovered by London authorities in August 2006. The airline revenue environment regained some momentum during late fourth quarter 2006, and, despite growing capacity 10 percent during the quarter, the Company achieved a record load factor of 70.2 percent at healthy yields, which resulted in a steady unit revenue growth rate of 4.2 percent. Based upon traffic and bookings to date, the Company expects 2007 first quarter unit revenue growth to exceed first quarter 2006s 9.15 cents per ASM. Consolidated freight revenues increased slightly versus 2005. An $18 million, or 17.1 percent, increase in freight and cargo revenues, primarily as a result of higher rates charged, was almost entirely offset by lower mail revenues. The lower mail revenues were primarily due to the Companys decision to discontinue carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service effective as of the end of second quarter 2006. Due to this mid year decision in 2006, the Company expects a year over year decrease in freight revenue for the first half of 2007. Other revenues increased $30 million, or 17.4 percent, compared to 2005, primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase Visa 17 Table of Contents card. The Company expects a similar increase in first quarter 2007, also due to higher commissions earned. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2006 increased $1.3 billion, or 18.9 percent, compared to the 8.8 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2006 and 2005 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2006 2005 (Decrease) Change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.29 3.27 .02 .6 % Fuel and oil 2.31 1.58 .73 46.2 Maintenance materials and repairs .51 .52 (.01 ) (1.9 ) Aircraft rentals .17 .19 (.02 ) (10.5 ) Landing fees and other rentals .53 .53 Depreciation and amortization .56 .55 .01 1.8 Other 1.43 1.41 .02 1.4 Total 8.80 8.05 .75 9.3 % Operating expenses per ASM increased 9.3 percent to 8.80 cents, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of gains from the Companys fuel hedging program. The Companys average cost per gallon of fuel increased 48.5 percent versus the prior year. Excluding fuel, year over year CASM was basically flat with 2005. Based on current cost trends, the Company expects first quarter 2007 unit costs, excluding fuel, to increase from 2006s full year figure of 6.49 cents. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased .6 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in average wage rates, mostly offset by productivity efforts that have enabled the Company to grow overall headcount at a rate that is less than the growth in ASMs. The Companys headcount at December 31, 2006, was 2.9 percent higher than at December 31, 2005, despite the 8.8 growth in available seat miles. The Company expects a similar performance for salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2007 versus first quarter 2006, due to higher wage rates partially offset by a reduction in share based compensation expense. The Companys Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents are subject to an agreement with the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL CIO (TWU), which becomes amendable on June 30, 2008. However, under certain conditions, TWU could elect to give notice to the Company by June 1, 2007, of its desire to make the agreement amendable on June 30, 2007. During second quarter 2006, TWU membership voted to not make the contract amendable on June 30, 2007. The Company is unable to predict whether future votes between now and June 2007 would result in the same outcome. The Companys Pilots are subject to an agreement with the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), which became amendable during September, 2006. The Company and SWAPA recently began discussions on a new agreement. Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 46.2 percent, net of hedging gains, primarily due to a significant increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon. Although the Companys fuel hedge position was not as strong as the position the Company held in 2005, the Companys hedging program still resulted in the realization of $675 million in cash settlements during 2006. These settlements resulted in a 2006 reduction to Fuel and oil expense of $634 million. However, even with this hedge position, the Companys jet fuel cost per gallon increased 48.5 percent versus 2005. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2006 was $1.53 compared to $1.03 in 2005, excluding fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, including the addition of blended winglets to all of the Companys 737 700 aircraft. The Company has also announced it will install blended winglets on a significant number of its 737 300 aircraft, beginning in first quarter 2007. 18 Table of Contents The Company has benefited from the recent decline in energy prices and is currently 100 percent protected with fuel derivative instruments for its first quarter 2007 jet fuel purchase requirements. These instruments are at an average crude oil equivalent price of $50 per barrel, and the majority of these positions effectively perform like option contracts allowing the Company to benefit in most cases from energy price decreases. Based on this protection and current market conditions, the Company expects its first quarter 2007 jet fuel cost per gallon to be in the $1.65 to $1.70 range, excluding the impact of any hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS 133. As of mid January 2007, the Company had fuel derivative contracts in place for approximately 95 percent of its expected fuel consumption for the remainder of 2007 at approximately $50 per barrel; 65 percent in 2008 at approximately $49 per barrel; over 50 percent in 2009 at approximately $51 per barrel; over 25 percent in 2010 at $63 per barrel; approximately 15 percent in 2011 at $64 per barrel, and 15 percent in 2012 at $63 per barrel. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 1.9 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to a decrease in repair events for aircraft engines. Based on the number of scheduled repair events for both engines and airframes in first quarter 2007, the Company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs per ASM compared to the 2006 figure of 51 cents. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 10.5 percent. The Companys 8.8 percent increase in ASMs was generated by the 36 aircraft the Company acquired during 2006, all of which were purchased. The number of aircraft on operating lease remained the same. The Company currently expects a similar year over year comparison for first quarter 2007. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM was flat compared to 2005. The Company currently expects a year over year increase in landing fees and other rentals per ASM for first quarter 2007 primarily due to higher rates paid for airport space. Depreciation expense per ASM increased 1.8 percent, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense per ASM from 36 new 737 700 aircraft purchased during 2006 and the resulting higher percentage of owned aircraft. The Company currently expects a similar year over year comparison for first quarter 2007. Other operating expenses per ASM increased 1.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in revenue related costs, such as credit card processing fees, from the Companys 20.2 percent increase in passenger revenues. The Company currently expects a similar year over year comparison for first quarter 2007. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $6 million, or 4.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in floating interest rates. This was partially offset by the Companys repayment of $607 million in debt during 2006. The majority of the Companys long term debt is at floating rates. In addition, the Company issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes during December 2006. Excluding the effect of any new debt offerings the Company may execute during 2007, the Company expects a reduction in interest expense compared to 2006, primarily due to a lower average debt balance. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capitalized interest increased $12 million, or 30.8 percent, compared to 2005 due to higher 2006 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries as well as higher interest rates. Interest income increased $37 million, or 78.7 percent, primarily due to an increase in rates earned on cash and investments. During 2006, the Company recognized approximately $52 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the Companys measurements of hedge effectiveness (i.e., the premium cost of fuel derivative option contracts.) Also during 2006, the Company recognized approximately $101 million of additional expense in Other (gains) losses, net, related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain contracts. In the second half of 2006, both current and forward prices for the commodities Southwest uses for hedging jet fuel fell significantly, resulting in a reduction in the unrealized gains the Company had experienced in prior periods. Of this additional expense, approximately $42 million was unrealized, mark to market changes in the fair value of derivatives due to the discontinuation of hedge accounting for certain contracts that will settle in future periods; approximately $39 million was ineffectiveness associated with the change in value of hedges designated for future periods; and $20 million was ineffectiveness and mark to market losses related to the change in value of contracts that settled during 2006. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. For 2005, the Company recognized approximately $35 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the Companys measurements of hedge effectiveness and $110 million in 19 Table of Contents additional income related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and unrealized mark to market changes in the fair value of certain derivative contracts. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 36.8 percent in 2006 from 37.9 percent in 2005. The decrease in the 2006 rate was primarily due to a $9 million reduction related to a revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during 2006. The Company currently expects its 2007 effective rate to be approximately 38 percent. 2005 Compared With 2004 The Companys consolidated net income for 2005 was $484 million ($.60 per share, diluted), as compared to 2004 net income of $215 million ($.27 per share, diluted), an increase of $269 million, or 125.1 percent. Operating income for 2005 was $725 million, an increase of $321 million, or 79.5 percent, compared to 2004. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenues from the Companys fleet growth, improved load factors, and higher fares, which more than offset a significant increase in the cost of jet fuel. The larger percentage increase in net income compared to operating income primarily was due to variability in Other (gains) losses, due to unrealized 2005 gains resulting from the Companys fuel hedging activities, in accordance with SFAS 133. Operating Revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 16.1 percent, primarily due to a $1.0 billion, or 15.9 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in capacity, an increase in RPM yield, and an increase in load factor. Holding other factors constant (such as yields and load factor), almost 70 percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the Companys 10.8 percent increase in available seat miles compared to 2004. The Company increased available seat miles as a result of the net addition of 28 aircraft (33 new 737 700 aircraft net of five 737 200 aircraft retirements). Approximately 18 percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the 2.8 percent increase in passenger yields. Average passenger fares increased 5.8 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to less fare discounting because of the strong demand for air travel coupled with the availability of fewer seats from industrywide domestic capacity reductions. The remainder of the passenger revenue increase primarily was due to the 1.2 point increase in the Companys load factor compared to 2004. Consolidated freight revenues increased $16 million, or 13.7 percent. Approximately 65 percent of the increase was due to an increase in freight and cargo revenues, primarily due to higher rates charged on shipments. The remaining 35 percent of the increase was due to higher mail revenues. The U.S. Postal Service periodically reallocates the amount of mail business given to commercial and freight air carriers and, during 2005, shifted more business to commercial carriers. Other revenues increased $39 million, or 29.3 percent, compared to 2004. Approximately 35 percent of the increase was from commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase Visa card. An additional 35 percent of the increase was due to an increase in excess baggage charges, as the Company modified its fee policy related to the weight of checked baggage during second quarter 2005. Among other changes, the limit at which baggage charges apply was reduced to 50 pounds per checked bag. 20 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2005 increased $733 million, or 12.0 percent, compared to the 10.8 percent increase in capacity. To a large extent, changes in operating expenses for airlines are driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2005 and 2004 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis: Increase Percent 2005 2004 (Decrease) Change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.27 3.35 (.08 ) (2.4 )% Fuel and oil 1.58 1.30 .28 21.5 Maintenance materials and repairs .52 .61 (.09 ) (14.8 ) Aircraft rentals .19 .23 (.04 ) (17.4 ) Landing fees and other rentals .53 .53 Depreciation and amortization .55 .56 (.01 ) (1.8 ) Other 1.41 1.39 .02 1.4 Total 8.05 7.97 .08 1.0 % Operating expenses per ASM increased 1.0 percent to 8.05 cents, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of hedging gains. The Company was able to hold flat or reduce unit costs in every cost category, except fuel expense and other operating expense, through a variety of cost reduction and productivity efforts. These efforts, however, were entirely offset by the significant increase in the cost of fuel. Excluding fuel, CASM was 2.8 percent lower than 2004, at 6.48 cents. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM decreased 2.4 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to a reduction in share based compensation expense, the majority of which is due to stock options granted by the Company. As a result of the timing of grants in prior years and their related vesting provisions, share based compensation expense decreased from $135 million in 2004 to $80 million in 2005. Excluding the impact of share based compensation expense, salaries, wages, and benefits decreased slightly due to productivity efforts that enabled the Company to grow overall headcount at a rate that was less than the growth in ASMs. This decrease was partially offset by higher average wage rates, and higher profitsharing expense associated with the Companys higher earnings. Fuel and oil expense per ASM increased 21.5 percent, primarily due to a 24.8 percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon, net of hedging gains. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2005 was $1.03 compared to 82.8 cents in 2004, excluding fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains. The Companys 2005 and 2004 average jet fuel costs are net of approximately $892 million and $455 million in gains from hedging activities, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company took to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft. These steps primarily included the addition of blended winglets to all of the Companys 737 700 aircraft, and the upgrade of certain engine components on many aircraft. The Company estimates that these and other efficiency gains saved the Company approximately $70 million during 2005, at average unhedged market jet fuel prices. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM decreased 14.8 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease in repair events for aircraft engines. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 17.4 percent. Of the 33 aircraft the Company acquired during 2005, all are owned. In addition, during 2005, the Company renegotiated the leases on four aircraft, and, as a result, reclassified these aircraft from operating leases to capital leases. These transactions increased the Companys percentage of aircraft owned or on capital lease to 81 percent at December 31, 2005, from 79 percent at December 31, 2004. Depreciation expense per ASM decreased 1.8 percent. An increase in depreciation expense per ASM from 33 new 737 700 aircraft purchased during 2005 and the higher percentage of owned aircraft, was more than offset by lower expense associated with the Companys retirement of its 737 200 fleet and all 737 200 remaining spare parts by the end of January 2005. Other operating expenses per ASM increased 1.4 percent compared to 2004. Approximately 75 percent of the increase related to higher 2005 security fees in the form of a $24 million retroactive assessment the Company received from the Transportation Security Administration in January 2006. The remainder of the increase 21 Table of Contents primarily related to higher fuel taxes as a result of the substantial increase in fuel prices compared to 2004. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $34 million, or 38.6 percent, primarily due to an increase in floating interest rates. The majority of the Companys long term debt is at floating rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capitalized interest was flat compared to 2004 as lower 2005 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries were offset by higher interest rates. Interest income increased $26 million, or 123.8 percent, primarily due to an increase in rates earned on cash and investments. Other (gains) losses, net primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with SFAS 133. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys hedging activities. During 2005, the Company recognized approximately $35 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the Companys measurements of hedge effectiveness. Also during 2005, the Company recognized approximately $110 million of additional income in Other (gains) losses, net, related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain contracts. Of this additional income, approximately $77 million was unrealized, mark to market changes in the fair value of derivatives due to the discontinuation of hedge accounting for certain contracts that will settle in future periods, approximately $9 million was unrealized ineffectiveness associated with hedges designated for future periods, and $24 million was ineffectiveness and mark to market gains related to contracts that settled during 2005. For 2004, the Company recognized approximately $24 million of expense related to amounts excluded from the Companys measurements of hedge effectiveness and $13 million in expense related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges and unrealized mark to market changes in the fair value of certain derivative contracts. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 37.9 percent in 2005 from 36.5 percent in 2004. The 2004 rate was favorably impacted by an adjustment related to the ultimate resolution of an airline industry wide issue regarding the tax treatment of certain aircraft engine maintenance costs, and lower state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in 2006 compared to $2.1 billion in 2005. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. The operating cash flows in both years were significantly impacted by fluctuations in counterparty deposits associated with the Companys fuel hedging program (counterparty deposits are reflected as an increase to Cash and a corresponding increase to Accrued liabilities.) There was a decrease in counterparty deposits of $410 million for 2006, versus an increase of $620 million during 2005. The decrease in these deposits during 2006 was due to the decline in fair value of the Companys fuel derivative portfolio from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006, especially during the second half of the year. The increase during 2005 was primarily due to a large increase in the fair value of the Companys fuel derivative instruments, as a result of escalating energy prices during 2005. Cash flows from operating activities for 2006 were also driven by the $499 million in net income, plus noncash depreciation and amortization expense of $515 million. For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Cash generated in 2006 and in 2005 was used primarily to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2006 totaled $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2005. Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 34 new 737 700 aircraft and two previously owned 737 700 aircraft in 2006 versus the purchase of 33 new 737 700s in 2005. In addition, progress payments for future deliveries were higher in 2006 than 2005. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2006 were also reduced by $117 million related to a change in the balance of the Companys short term investments, namely auction rate securities. Net cash used in financing activities was $801 million in 2006, primarily from the repurchase of $800 million of common stock and the repayment of $607 million 22 Table of Contents in debt. The Company repurchased a total of 49 million shares of outstanding common stock during 2006 as a result of three buyback programs authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. These uses were partially offset by the issuance of $300 million senior unsecured 5.75% notes in December 2006 and $260 million in proceeds from exercises of Employee stock options. During 2005, the Company generated a net $260 million from financing activities primarily from the issuance of $300 million senior unsecured 5.125% notes in February 2005, and proceeds of $132 million from exercises of Employee stock options. These were partially offset by the redemption of the Companys $100 million senior unsecured 8% notes in March 2005 and the repurchase of $55 million of common stock. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt. The Company has various options available to meet its 2007 capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand and short term investments at December 31, 2006, totaling $1.8 billion, internally generated funds, and a $600 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability. The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion in public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it may utilize for aircraft financings or other purposes in the future. The Company may issue a portion of these securities in 2007, primarily to fund current fleet growth plans or to take advantage of certain strategic growth opportunities if they were to arise. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The Company received 36, 737 700 aircraft in 2006 34 of which were new aircraft from Boeing, and two of which were pre owned and purchased from a third party. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had exercised all remaining options for aircraft to be delivered in 2007, and has firm orders for 37 737 700 aircraft in 2007, 30 in 2008, 18 in 2009, and ten each in 2010 2012. The Company also had options for four 737 700 aircraft in 2008, 18 in 2009, 32 in 2010, and 30 each in 2011 and 2012. Southwest also has an additional 54 purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft for the years 2008 through 2014. The Company has the option to substitute 737 600s or 800s for the 700s. This option is applicable to aircraft ordered from the manufacturer and must be exercised 18 months prior to the contractual delivery date. The leasing of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating the aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. The Company operates 93 aircraft leased from third parties, of which 84 are operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft are included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the letters of credit are an off balance sheet item, the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $211 million at December 31, 2006. 23 Table of Contents The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006: Obligations by Period 2008 2010 Beyond Contractual Obligations 2007 2009 2011 2011 Total (In millions) Long term debt(1) $ 111 $ 25 $ 29 $ 1,507 $ 1,672 Interest commitments(2) 45 80 80 277 482 Capital lease commitments(3) 16 32 27 75 Operating lease commitments 360 598 453 1,000 2,411 Aircraft purchase commitments(4) 1,004 1,225 656 184 3,069 Other purchase commitments 34 47 26 107 Total contractual obligations $ 1,570 $ 2,007 $ 1,271 $ 2,968 $ 7,816 (1) Includes current maturities, but excludes amounts associated with interest rate swap agreements (2) Related to fixed rate debt (3) Includes amounts classified as interest (4) Firm orders from the manufacturer There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2006. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys revolving credit facility. In January 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys common stock, utilizing present and anticipated proceeds from the exercise of Employee stock options. Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. This program was completed during first quarter 2005, resulting in the total repurchase of approximately 20.9 million of the Companys common shares. In 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized three separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of $1.0 billion of the Companys Common Stock $300 million authorized in January 2006, $300 million authorized in May 2006, and $400 million authorized in November 2006. Repurchases have been made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. Through December 31, 2006, these programs resulted in the repurchase of a total of 49.1 million shares for $800 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (GAAP). The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The Companys Air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2006 was $799 million, compared to $649 million as of December 31, 2005. 24 Table of Contents Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable) that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Holding other factors constant, a ten percent change in the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets for 2006 would have resulted in a $16 million, or .2%, change in Passenger revenues recognized for that period. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns, as noted, can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. No material adjustments were recorded for years 2004, 2005, or 2006. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting for Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $13.9 billion (at cost) of long lived assets, including $11.8 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 397 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2006, which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 84 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2006, are on operating lease. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: Estimated Residual Estimated Useful Life value Aircraft and engines 23 to 25 years 15% Aircraft parts Fleet life 4% Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10% Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term 0% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of the Companys aircraft. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required by GAAP. 25 Table of Contents When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). See Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on SFAS 133, the Companys fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2006, the Company was a party to over 480 financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging program, for year 2007 and beyond. The fair value of the Companys fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, was $999 million, compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The large decrease in fair value primarily was due to the decrease in energy prices in the second half of 2006, as well as the expiration of approximately $675 million in fuel derivative instruments that related to 2006, net of new derivative instruments the Company added for future years. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically, as was evident during both 2005 and 2006, based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, and general economic conditions, among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. In recent years, because of increased volatility in energy markets, the Companys estimates have materially differed from actual results, resulting in increased volatility in the Companys periodic financial results. Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period. 26 Table of Contents Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to Other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities, especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value of the Companys fuel derivatives and the recent volatility in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period, including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate. This may result, and has resulted, in increased volatility in the Companys financial statements. The significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products, and the volatility of the different types of products the Company uses for protection. The number of instances in which the Company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, has increased recently, primarily due to these reasons. In these cases, the Company has determined that the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the time period remaining until settlement and therefore must discontinue special hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS 133. When this happens, any changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings in the period of change. As the fair value of the Companys hedge positions increases in amount, there is a higher degree of probability that there will be continued variability recorded in the income statement and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in future periods will be material. This is primarily due to the fact that small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes. SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements, including the documentation of a Company hedging strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis, and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is designated by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes. The Company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are used in the measurement of effectiveness for the Companys fuel hedges, as required by SFAS 133. During first quarter 2006, the Company did revise its method for forecasting future cash flows. Previously, the Company had estimated future cash flows using actual market forward prices of like commodities and adjusting for historical differences from the Companys actual jet fuel purchase prices. The Companys new methodology utilizes a statistical based regression equation with data from market forward prices of like commodities. This equation is then adjusted for certain items, such as transportation costs, that are stated in the Companys fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors. This change to the Companys methodology for estimating future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) was applied prospectively, in accordance with the Companys interpretation of SFAS 133. The Company believes that this change for estimating future cash flows will result in more effective hedges over the long term. The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements. The primary objective for the Companys use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities. During 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, and $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates due 2006. The interest rate swap associated with the $375 million 5.496% Class A 2 pass through certificates expired on the date the certificates were repaid in fourth quarter 2006. The floating rate paid under the swap associated with the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012 sets in arrears. The Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months and receives 6.5% every six months on a notional amount of $385 million until 2012. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2006 is estimated to be 7.63 percent based on actual and forward rates at December 31, 2006. 27 Table of Contents The Company is also party to an interest rate swap agreement relating to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, in which the floating rate is set at the beginning of each six month period. Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.25% every six months on a notional amount of $350 million until 2014. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2006 was 5.69 percent. The Companys interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. Under the shortcut method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and, thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2006, was a liability of approximately $30 million. The comparable fair value of these same agreements at December 31, 2005, was a liability of $31 million. The long term portion of these amounts are recorded in Other deferred liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for each respective year. In accordance with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments, and forward jet fuel prices, would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Share Based Compensation The Company has share based compensation plans covering the majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via collective bargaining, a plan covering the Companys Board of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with one Executive Officer of the Company. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of Employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. However, prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment using the modified retrospective transition method. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of Employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. In addition, results for prior periods have been retroactively adjusted utilizing the pro forma disclosures in those prior financial statements, except as noted. As part of this revision, the Company recorded cumulative share based compensation expense of $409 million for the period 1995 2005, resulting in a reduction to Retained earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. This adjustment, along with the creation of a net Deferred income tax asset in the amount of $130 million, resulted in an offsetting increase to Capital in excess of par value in the amount of $539 million in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The Deferred tax asset represents the portion of the cumulative expense related to stock options that will result in a future tax deduction. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, certain assumptions used in the Black Scholes model, such as expected term, can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Companys stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term. For 2005 and 2006, the Company has relied on observations of both historical volatility trends, implied future volatility 28 Table of Contents observations as determined by independent third parties, and implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock. For both 2006 and 2005 stock option grants, the Company utilized expected volatility based on the expected life of the option, but within a range of 25% to 27%. Prior to 2005, the Company relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input for determining the estimated fair value of stock options. In determining the expected term of the option grants, the Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield of the Companys common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Companys current dividend yield, and adjusted for anticipated future changes. Vesting terms for the Companys stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted. For grants made to Employees under collective bargaining plans, vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement. For Other Employee Plans, options vest and become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of continued employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants in any of the Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. None of the Companys grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions, as defined. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has $74 million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to past grants of stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. The total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized compensation cost is approximately ten years; however, the majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two years, in accordance with vesting provisions. Over 80 percent of net unrecognized amount at December 31, 2006, related to options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. In addition, the vast majority of the $80 million in share based compensation expense reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006, was related to options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Based on Employee stock options expected to vest during 2007, the number of options eligible to be granted in future periods and the Companys expectation of future grants, the Company expects the expense related to share based compensation to decrease significantly during 2007 compared to 2006 expense. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Forward Looking Statements Some statements in this Form 10 K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the Companys behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) which are not historical facts, may be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are based on, and include statements about, Southwests estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements. Specific forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and include, without limitation, words such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, forecasts, may, will, should, and similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by Southwests forward looking statements or from historical experience or the Companys present expectations. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Companys forward looking statements, which represent the Companys views only as of the date this report is filed. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement, 29 Table of Contents whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 93 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Fuel Hedging The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2007. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $15 million per year, excluding any impact of the Companys derivative instruments. The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2006, were net assets of $999 million. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $369 million, is classified as Fuel derivative contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $630 million, is included in Other assets. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2006, prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to $480 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2006, levels, except underlying futures prices. Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. At December 31, 2006, the Company had agreements with eight counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31, 2006, the Company held $540 million in cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions. These collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally eliminate, the credit risk associated with the Companys hedging program. The deposits are included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Market Risk The vast majority of the Companys assets are aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an A credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with Standard & Poors and Fitch ratings agencies, and a Baa1 credit rating with Moodys rating agency. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has 30 Table of Contents converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. This includes the Companys $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012 and the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. Excluding the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes, and the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling $800 million at December 31, 2006. These senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of 10.2 years at fixed rates averaging 5.98 percent at December 31, 2006, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $843 million, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 7.0 years at floating rates averaging 6.74 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. In total, the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 7.4 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2006. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.4 billion, and short term investments, which totaled $369 million, at December 31, 2006. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money market instruments, investment grade commercial paper, auction rate securities, and other highly rated financial instruments. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2006, would not have a material affect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash, and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2006, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $3 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance, short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement, the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements. Covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings. For the revolving credit facility, the Company shall also maintain, at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 1.25 to 1.0. The Company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of December 31, 2006. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written. 31 Table of Contents
