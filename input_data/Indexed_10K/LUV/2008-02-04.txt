Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Year in Review Several events were significant for Southwest during 2007. For example, Southwest: * Extended its string of consecutive profitable years to 35 and consecutive profitable quarters to 67. Both of these marks are unmatched in the modern era of aviation results. * Implemented a new Customer boarding method for flights to significantly reduce the average time a Customer spends waiting in line at the gate, while retaining the Companys famous open seating policy once aboard the aircraft. * Introduced a new fare structure including a Business Select product, which enables Customers to be among the first to board the aircraft. We also unveiled enhancements to our Rapid Rewards program. * Began a significant gate re design to enhance the airport experience for Customers, to be installed at virtually all airports served by the Company. * Grew the Companys fleet by 39 Boeing 737 700 aircraft to a total of 520 737s as of December 31, 2007. * Earned $727 million (on a cash basis, before profitsharing and income taxes) from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivative instruments the Company had previously entered into to protect against jet fuel price increases. * Incurred a one time $25 million charge (before profitsharing and income taxes) related to an early retirement program that was offered by the Company and accepted by more than 600 Employees during third quarter 2007, as one of many efforts underway to improve the Companys future profitability. * Announced an expansion of our GDS (Global Distribution System) and corporate travel account efforts through an agreement with Travelports Galileo and Worldspan. * Recommenced service to San Francisco International Airport, with the highest initial concentration of flights of any new city in the Companys history. * Repurchased 66 million shares of Company common stock totaling $1.0 billion through programs authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. Although the Companys 2007 net income of $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted) exceeded its 2006 net income of $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted), the increase was entirely driven by certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods. In fact, the Companys operating income, which excludes these items, actually declined 15.3 percent from 2006 to 2007, primarily due to the significant increase in fuel costs, which the Company was not able to recover through increased revenues. The airline revenue environment was more difficult than the Company envisioned coming into 2007. This was due to a slowing economy as well as continued competitive pressures from both new airlines as well as those that have significantly reduced their cost structures through the bankruptcy process or the threat of bankruptcy. The Company did raise fares several times during 2007 in an attempt to offset fuel cost pressures; however, these increases did not keep up with the rapidly increasing fuel prices. Looking ahead to 2008, the Company believes it has retained, and in some cases strengthened, its low cost competitive advantages as demonstrated by its protective fuel hedging position, excellent Employees, and strong balance sheet. These enable Southwest to respond quickly to potential industry consolidation and to favorable market opportunities in the face of an uncertain economy and record energy prices. Based on current and projected energy prices for 2008 and expected growth plans, the Company believes net cash expenditures for jet fuel, which exclude certain FAS 133 gains and losses, could increase more than $500 million compared to 2007, even including the effects of fuel derivative contracts the Company has in place as of January 2008. The Companys fuel derivative contracts in place for 2008 provide protection for over 70 percent of the Companys expected jet fuel consumption at an average price of approximately $51 per barrel of crude oil. The Company is also currently expecting a significant increase in its aircraft engine maintenance activity in 2008. The Company will attempt to overcome the impact of higher anticipated 2008 fuel prices and other cost pressures through improved revenues and continued focus on non fuel costs. Based on this current outlook, Southwest has reduced its previously planned growth rate for 2008. The Company currently plans to grow its fleet by a net seven aircraft. The Company will add 29 new 737 700 aircraft from Boeing, but plans to return from lease or sell a total of 22 aircraft, resulting in a net available seat mile (ASM) capacity 18 Table of Contents increase of four to five percent. For first quarter 2008, the Companys year over year capacity increase is expected to slightly exceed six percent. Based on current plans, the Companys fleet is scheduled to total 527 737s by the end of 2008. Results of Operations 2007 Compared With 2006 Southwests profit of $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted) in 2007 was an increase of $146 million, or 29.3 percent, compared to the Companys 2006 net income of $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted). However, the Companys net profit results in both 2007 and 2006 include certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with SFAS 133, that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods. These adjustments, which are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives, are included in Other (gains) losses, which is below the operating income line, in both periods. In 2007, these adjustments totaled net gains of $360 million. For 2006, these adjustments totaled net losses of $101 million. Therefore, Southwest believes operating income provides a better indication of the Companys financial performance for both 2007 and 2006 than does net income. Southwests 2007 operating income was $791 million, a decrease of $143 million, or 15.3 percent, compared to 2006. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by a substantial increase in fuel expense, despite the fact that the Company once again benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program. The Company had instruments in place to protect against over 90 percent of its fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of $50 per barrel. This resulted in a $686 million reduction to Fuel and oil expense during 2007, although, even with this protection, the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon increased from $1.53 in 2006 to $1.70 in 2007. Although fuel prices began 2007 at moderately high levels, they quickly increased and stayed at record levels throughout most of the second half of the year. Market crude oil prices flirted with $100 per barrel several times during 2007 and market (unhedged) jet fuel prices reached as high as $2.87 per gallon during the second half of the year. Operating Revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $775 million, or 8.5 percent, primarily due to a $707 million, or 8.1 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to an increase in capacity, as the Company added aircraft and flights, resulting in a 7.5 percent increase in available seat miles compared to 2006. The Company purchased a total of 37 new Boeing 737 700 aircraft during 2007, and added another two leased 737 700s from a previous owner, resulting in the addition of 39 aircraft for the year. The Company attempted to combat high fuel prices through modest fare increases. However, general economic conditions as well as significant low fare competition made it difficult to raise fares as much as the Company had done in 2006. The Companys passenger revenue yield per RPM (passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles) increased 1.2 percent compared to 2006. Unit revenue (total revenue divided by available seat miles) also increased 0.9 percent compared to 2006 levels, as a result of the higher RPM yield. The Company has been encouraged by more recent year over year unit revenue trends, which improved each month during fourth quarter 2007. The improved trends have continued thus far in first quarter 2008. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our nations overall economy, however, it is difficult for the Company to precisely predict first quarter 2008 revenues. Consolidated freight revenues decreased $4 million, or 3.0 percent, versus 2006. A $10 million, or 8.5 percent, increase in freight revenues, resulting primarily from higher rates, was more than offset by a $14 million decline in mail revenues. The lower mail revenues were due to the Companys decision to discontinue carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service effective as of the end of second quarter 2006. The Company expects an increase in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter 2008, primarily due to an increase in capacity and higher rates charged. Other revenues increased $72 million, or 35.6 percent, compared to 2006, primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase Visa card. The Company currently expects another increase in first quarter 2008, also due to higher commissions earned, and at a somewhat comparable rate to the 2007 increase. 19 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2007 increased $918 million, or 11.3 percent, compared to a 7.5 percent increase in capacity. Historically, changes in operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2007 and 2006 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): Increase Percent 2007 2006 (Decrease) Change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.22 3.29 (.07 ) (2.1 )% Fuel and oil 2.55 2.31 .24 10.4 Maintenance materials and repairs .62 .51 .11 21.6 Aircraft rentals .16 .17 (.01 ) (5.9 ) Landing fees and other rentals .56 .53 .03 5.7 Depreciation and amortization .56 .56 Other 1.43 1.43 Total 9.10 8.80 .30 3.4 % The Companys 2007 CASM (cost per available seat mile) increased 3.4 percent compared to 2006. Approximately 80 percent of this increase was solely due to the increase in fuel expense, net of gains from the Companys fuel hedging program. The remainder of the increase was due to higher maintenance expense. All other operating expense categories combined to be approximately flat compared to 2006. Due to higher fuel prices, the Company has intensified its focus on controlling non fuel costs and continues to mitigate wage rate and benefit cost pressures through productivity and efficiency improvements. The Companys headcount per aircraft at December 31, 2007, was 66, versus a year ago level of 68. From the end of 2003 to the end of 2007, Southwests headcount per aircraft decreased 22 percent, as the Company implemented various technology improvements, which improved efficiency and enabled the Company to grow capacity without a commensurate increase in headcount. Based on current cost trends, the Company expects first quarter 2008 unit costs to increase from first quarter 2007s 8.93 cents, due primarily to a significant increase in fuel costs and the continuation of higher maintenance costs. The higher expected fuel costs are due to the fact that the Companys protective position as to fuel derivative instruments is not as favorable as first quarter 2007, and current physical (unhedged) jet fuel prices are significantly higher than the prior year. On an absolute dollar basis, Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $161 million, primarily from a $204 million increase in salaries and wages, partially offset by a $43 million decrease in benefits. The dollar increase in salaries and wages was due primarily to a 5.2 percent headcount increase, and the dollar decrease in benefits was due primarily to a $33 million decrease in profitsharing, attributable to lower income available for profitsharing, and a $43 million decrease in share based compensation, due to fewer Employee stock options becoming vested during 2007 versus 2006. These benefits decreases were partially offset by higher healthcare costs. Although the Companys net income was higher than 2006, income available for profitsharing was lower, since the Companys profitsharing plan does not consider the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program as a result of SFAS 133. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM decreased 2.1 percent compared to 2006, primarily due to lower profitsharing expense and lower share based compensation expense, despite the increase in ASMs. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SFAS 133 and fuel hedging, and Note 13 for further information on share based compensation. Based on current trends, the Company expects salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2008 to be in line with first quarter 2007s unit cost. The Companys Pilots are subject to an agreement with the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), which became amendable during September 2006. The Company and SWAPA are currently in discussions on a new agreement. The Companys Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement with the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL CIO (TWU), which becomes amendable in June 2008. The Companys Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents are subject to an agreement with the TWU, which becomes amendable in July 2008. However, 20 Table of Contents the Company and TWU began negotiations on a new agreement in January 2008. The Companys Stock Clerks are subject to an agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the Companys Mechanics are subject to an agreement with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Both of these agreements become amendable in August 2008. The Companys Customer Service and Reservations Agents are subject to an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL CIO, which becomes amendable in November 2008. Fuel and oil expense increased $398 million, and on a per ASM basis increased 10.4 percent versus 2006. Approximately 60 percent of the dollar increase was due to an increase in fuel prices, and the remainder was from an increase in gallons consumed to support the 7.5 percent capacity increase versus 2006. On a per ASM basis, nearly the entire increase was due to higher fuel prices. The fuel derivative instruments the Company held for 2007 were not as favorable as those held in the prior year, as they were at higher average crude oil equivalent prices than the instruments that settled/expired in 2006. Despite this, the Companys hedging program resulted in the realization of $727 million in cash settlements during 2007. These settlements generated a 2007 reduction to Fuel and oil expense of $686 million, compared to the prior year when the Companys fuel derivative instruments resulted in a $634 million reduction to Fuel and oil expense. Even with these significant hedge positions in both years, the Companys jet fuel cost per gallon increased 11.1 percent versus 2006. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2007 was $1.70 compared to $1.53 in 2006, excluding fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2007 increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, including the addition of blended winglets to all of the Companys 737 700 aircraft. The Company is also in the process of installing blended winglets on a significant number of its 737 300 aircraft. The Company holds a significant fuel hedge position for 2008, although for a lower percentage of forecasted consumption than in 2007. As of mid January 2008, the Company is nearly 75 percent protected with fuel derivative instruments for its first quarter 2008 jet fuel requirements, at an average crude oil equivalent price of $51 per barrel, and the majority of these positions effectively perform like option contracts allowing the Company to benefit in most cases from energy price decreases. During first quarter 2007, market prices (unhedged) for jet fuel averaged $1.81 per gallon, and the Company had fuel derivatives in place to protect against nearly 100 percent of its fuel usage at a crude oil equivalent price of $50 per barrel. January 2008 average market prices (unhedged) for jet fuel have been in the $2.60 to $2.65 range. Based on this difference in protection and current market conditions, the Company expects its first quarter 2008 jet fuel cost per gallon to be approximately $2.00 per gallon, excluding the impact of any hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in SFAS 133. In addition, the Company had fuel derivative contracts in place for over 70 percent of its expected fuel consumption for the remainder of 2008 at approximately $51 per barrel; over 55 percent in 2009 at approximately $51 per barrel; nearly 30 percent in 2010 at approximately $63 per barrel; over 15 percent in 2011 at $64 per barrel; and over 15 percent in 2012 at $63 per barrel. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 21.6 percent compared to 2006, while increasing $148 million on a dollar basis. On a dollar basis, engine expense accounted for over 45 percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for over 43 percent of the increase. With respect to airframe expense, the Company completed significantly more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in the prior year. These events, which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown, were higher in number as well as cost per event, and were also due to the ongoing transition to a new airframe maintenance program for 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft which began in 2006. In engine expense, there was a significant increase in repairs for the Companys 737 700 aircraft engines primarily due to the maturation of this fleet, which was introduced in 1997, and more repair events than expected. On a per ASM basis, approximately 48 percent of the increase in maintenance materials and repairs was a result of the higher airframe expense, and approximately 43 percent of the increase was due to the higher engine expense. In first quarter 2008, the Company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs per ASM compared to first quarter 2007 and fourth quarter 2007, due to higher engine expense for 737 700 aircraft as well as continued higher airframe expense from the transition of aircraft to the Companys new airframe maintenance program for 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 5.9 percent and, on a dollar basis, decreased slightly. The decrease per ASM was due primarily to the fact that the Company increased overall ASMs by 7.5 percent, but the number of aircraft on operating lease increased by only two from 2006 to 2007. The Company added 37 21 Table of Contents purchased aircraft to its fleet during 2007, and leased two additional 737 700 aircraft. The Company currently expects similar year over year rental expense comparisons for first quarter 2008. Landing fees and other rentals increased $65 million on a dollar basis and 5.7 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2006. The dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in airport gate space to support the increase in capacity and trips flown versus 2006. On a per ASM basis, the increase was due primarily to higher rates paid for airport space. The Company currently expects a year over year increase in landing fees and other rentals per ASM for first quarter 2008, primarily due to higher rates paid for airport space. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $40 million on a dollar basis compared to 2006, but was flat on a per ASM basis. The dollar increase was due primarily to 37 new 737 700 aircraft purchased during 2007. Based on current fleet and growth plans, the Company expects a similar year over year comparison for first quarter 2008 on a per ASM basis. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys future aircraft deliveries. Other operating expenses increased $108 million but were flat on a per ASM basis, compared to 2006. On a dollar basis, approximately 20 percent of the increase was due to an increase in revenue related costs associated with the 8.1 percent increase in passenger revenues (such as credit card processing fees) and approximately 20 percent was due to higher personnel expenses (which includes items associated with flight crew travel, such as hotel and per diem costs) caused by the increase in capacity and trips flown. Excluding anticipated gains from the sale of aircraft, the Company currently expects an increase in other operating expenses on a per ASM basis for first quarter 2008 compared to first quarter 2007, assuming increased revenues. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased by $9 million, or 7.0 percent, primarily due to the Companys repayment of $729 million in debt during 2006 and 2007. This was partially offset by the issuance of $800 million in new debt instruments in 2006 and 2007; however, the timing of the new debt issued compared to the debt repaid resulted in lower expense for 2007. The Company currently expects an increase in interest expense compared to 2007, primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with recent borrowings in late 2006 and in 2007. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined slightly compared to 2006 due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries. Interest income decreased $40 million, or 47.6 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average cash and short term investment balances on which the Company earns interest. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the Companys hedging activities and SFAS 133. During 2007, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they didnt qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. The gains resulted from the dramatic increase in the fair value of the Companys portfolio of fuel derivative instruments as commodity prices reached record levels. During 2006, the Company recorded losses related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges, as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they didnt qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, as commodity prices declined during that year. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 (In millions) Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (219 ) $ 42 Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net (51 ) 39 Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (90 ) 20 Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 58 52 Other 10 (2 ) $ (292 ) $ 151 22 Table of Contents See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 39.0 percent in 2007 from 36.8 percent in 2006. The higher 2007 rate included an $11 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net addition related to a revision in Illinois income tax laws enacted in 2007. The 2006 rate included a $9 million net reduction related to a revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during 2006. The Company currently expects its 2008 effective tax rate to be between 36 and 37 percent. The lower expected 2008 rate is primarily due to the January 2008 reversal of the 2007 Illinois tax law change, that resulted in the $11 million tax increase. The Company currently expects to reverse the $11 million net charge during first quarter 2008. 2006 Compared With 2005 The Companys consolidated net income for 2006 was $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted), as compared to 2005 net income of $484 million ($.60 per share, diluted), an increase of $15 million, or 3.1 percent. Operating income for 2006 was $934 million, an increase of $209 million, or 28.8 percent, compared to 2005. The 2006 increase in operating income was due primarily to higher revenues from the Companys fleet growth, improved load factors, and higher fares, which more than offset a significant increase in the cost of jet fuel. In both 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized adjustments related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives, which are included in Other (gains) losses. For 2006, these adjustments totaled net losses of $101 million. For 2005, these adjustments totaled net gains of $110 million. Operating Revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, or 19.8 percent, almost entirely due to a $1.5 billion, or 20.2 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues was due primarily to an increase in capacity, an increase in RPM yield, and an increase in load factor. Approximately 45 percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the Companys 8.8 percent increase in available seat miles compared to 2005. The Company increased available seat miles as a result of the addition of 36 737 700 aircraft. Approximately 35 percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to a 6.9 percent increase in passenger yields. Average passenger fares increased 11.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to less fare discounting because of strong demand for air travel coupled with the availability of fewer seats as a result of industrywide domestic capacity reductions. The remainder of the passenger revenue increase was due primarily to the 2.4 point increase in the Companys load factor compared to 2005. The airline revenue environment changed significantly from the first half of 2006 to the second half of the year. The Company believes this was due to both reduced demand related to domestic economic factors, as well as the effects of the increased carryon baggage restrictions put in place following the terrorist plot uncovered by London authorities in August 2006. The airline revenue environment regained some momentum during late fourth quarter 2006, and, despite growing capacity 10 percent during the quarter, the Company achieved a record load factor of 70.2 percent at healthy yields, which resulted in a unit revenue growth rate of 4.2 percent. Consolidated freight revenues increased slightly versus 2005. An $18 million, or 17.1 percent, increase in freight and cargo revenues, primarily as a result of higher rates charged, was almost entirely offset by lower mail revenues. The lower mail revenues were due to the Companys decision to discontinue carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service effective as of the end of second quarter 2006. Other revenues increased $30 million, or 17.4 percent, compared to 2005, primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase Visa card. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2006 increased $1.3 billion, or 18.9 percent, compared to the 8.8 percent increase in capacity. Historically, changes in operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes in capacity, or 23 Table of Contents ASMs. The following presents Southwests operating expenses per ASM for 2006 and 2005 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM and or an absolute dollar basis: Increase Percent 2006 2005 (Decrease) Change Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.29 3.27 .02 .6 % Fuel and oil 2.31 1.58 .73 46.2 Maintenance materials and repairs .51 .52 (.01 ) (1.9 ) Aircraft rentals .17 .19 (.02 ) (10.5 ) Landing fees and other rentals .53 .53 Depreciation and amortization .56 .55 .01 1.8 Other 1.43 1.41 .02 1.4 Total 8.80 8.05 .75 9.3 % Operating expenses per ASM increased 9.3 percent to 8.80 cents, primarily due to an increase in jet fuel prices, net of gains from the Companys fuel hedging program. The Companys average cost per gallon of fuel increased 48.5 percent versus the prior year. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM increased .6 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in average wage rates, largely offset by productivity efforts that enabled the Company to grow overall headcount at a rate less than the growth in ASMs. The Companys headcount at December 31, 2006, was 2.9 percent higher than at December 31, 2005, despite the 8.8 percent growth in available seat miles. On a dollar basis, Salaries, wages and benefits increased $270 million, of which $197 million was solely wages. The $197 million increase in wages represented a 10.1 percent increase compared to 2005, on an 8.8 percent increase in ASMs. Of the $197 million increase in wages, the majority was related to the increase in average wage rates. Fuel and oil expense increased $797 million, and on a per ASM basis increased 46.2 percent, net of hedging gains, primarily due to a significant increase in the average cost per gallon of jet fuel. Although the Companys fuel hedge position was not as strong as the position the Company held in 2005, the Companys hedging program still resulted in the realization of $675 million in cash settlements during 2006. These settlements resulted in a 2006 reduction to Fuel and oil expense of $634 million. However, even with this hedge position, the Companys jet fuel cost per gallon increased 48.5 percent versus 2005. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2006 was $1.53 compared to $1.03 in 2005, excluding fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, including the addition of blended winglets to all of the Companys 737 700 aircraft. On an absolute dollar basis, maintenance materials and repairs expense increased $22 million, primarily due to an increase in the number of aircraft engine repairs. However, on a per ASM basis, maintenance materials and repairs decreased 1.9 percent compared to 2005, as the dollar increase was only 4.9 percent versus the capacity (ASM) increase of 8.8 percent. Aircraft rentals per ASM decreased 10.5 percent. The Companys 8.8 percent increase in ASMs was generated by the 36 aircraft the Company acquired during 2006, all of which were purchased. The number of aircraft on operating lease remained the same, thereby reducing the percentage of these aircraft in the total fleet. On an absolute dollar basis, expense decreased $5 million due to the renegotiation of some aircraft leases at lower rates. Landing fees and other rentals per ASM was flat compared to 2005. On a dollar basis, expense increased $41 million, primarily due to the Companys increase in airport space to support additional flight activity. Depreciation and amortization expense per ASM increased 1.8 percent, and on a dollar basis increased $46 million. These increases were primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense per ASM from 36 new 737 700 aircraft purchased during 2006 and the resulting higher percentage of owned aircraft. In absolute dollars, Other operating expenses increased $122 million, of which $39 million related to credit card processing fees. The $39 million increase in credit card processing fees represented a 22.2 percent increase from 2005 compared to the Companys 20.2 percent increase in Passenger revenues. In excess of 97 percent of Passenger revenues are booked via customer credit cards, resulting in a close correlation between these two measures. The second 24 Table of Contents and third largest increases in Other operating expenses on an absolute dollar basis were in Fuel taxes ($18 million, or 14.0 percent, primarily due to a 15.0 percent increase in the unhedged cost of jet fuel per gallon and a 7.9 percent increase in gallons consumed), and Personnel expenses ($16 million, or 11.9 percent, primarily representing hotel and per diem costs for Pilots and Flight Attendants, primarily due to a 6.2 percent increase in trips flown). Other operating expenses per ASM increased 1.4 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenue related costs, such as credit card processing fees, related to the Companys 20.2 percent increase in Passenger revenues. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $6 million, or 4.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in floating interest rates. This was partially offset by the Companys repayment during 2006 of $607 million in debt. The majority of the Companys long term debt is at floating rates. In addition, the Company issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes during December 2006. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Capitalized interest increased $12 million, or 30.8 percent, compared to 2005, due to higher 2006 progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries as well as higher interest rates. Interest income increased $37 million, or 78.7 percent, primarily due to an increase in rates earned on cash and investments. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the Companys hedging activities and SFAS 133. During 2006, the Company recorded losses related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as the decrease in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they didnt qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. The losses resulted from the decrease in the fair value of the Companys portfolio of fuel derivative instruments as commodity prices declined during the year. During 2005, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they didnt qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, as commodity prices increased during that year. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: (In millions) 2006 2005 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ 42 $ (77 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net 39 (9 ) Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net 20 (24 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 52 35 Other (2 ) (15 ) $ 151 $ (90 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 36.8 percent in 2006 from 37.9 percent in 2005. The decrease in the 2006 rate was due primarily to a $9 million net reduction related to a revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 billion in 2007 compared to $1.4 billion in 2006. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. The operating cash flows in both 2007 and 2006 were also significantly impacted by fluctuations in counterparty deposits associated with the Companys fuel hedging program (counterparty deposits are reflected as an increase to Cash and a corresponding increase to Accrued liabilities). There was an increase in counterparty deposits of $1.5 billion for 2007, versus a decrease of $410 million during 2006. The increase in these deposits during 2007 was due to the significant increase in fair value of the Companys fuel derivative portfolio from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007. The decrease during 2006 was due primarily to a decrease in the fair value of the Companys fuel derivative instruments, as a result of a decline in energy commodity 25 Table of Contents prices during 2006. Cash flows associated with purchasing and or selling derivatives are also classified as operating cash flows, although these amounts were not material for 2007 or 2006. Cash flows from operating activities for 2007 were also driven by the $645 million in net income, plus noncash depreciation and amortization expense of $555 million. For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Cash generated in 2007 and in 2006 was used primarily to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2007 totaled $1.5 billion, approximately the same as in 2006. Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 37 new 737 700 aircraft in 2007 (the remaining two 737 700s added to the fleet during 2007 were leased) versus the purchase of 36 737 700s in 2006. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2007 were also reduced by $198 million related to a change in the balance of the Companys short term investments, namely auction rate securities. Net cash used in financing activities was $493 million in 2007, primarily from the repurchase of $1.0 billion of common stock. The Company repurchased a total of 66 million shares of outstanding common stock during 2007 as a result of buyback programs authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. These uses were partially offset by the October 2007 issuance of $500 million Pass Through Certificates consisting of $412 million 6.15% Series A certificates and $88 million 6.65% Series B certificates. Net cash used in financing activities was $801 million in 2006, primarily from the repurchase of $800 million of common stock and the repayment of $607 million in debt. The Company repurchased a total of 49 million shares of outstanding common stock during 2006 as a result of three buyback programs authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. These uses were partially offset by the issuance of $300 million senior unsecured 5.75% notes in December 2006 and $260 million in proceeds from exercises of Employee stock options. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt. The Company has various options available to meet its 2008 capital and operating commitments, including cash on hand and short term investments at December 31, 2007, totaling $2.8 billion, internally generated funds, and a $600 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. The Company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability. The Company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $540 million in public debt securities and pass through certificates, which it may utilize for aircraft financings or other purposes in the future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The Company received 39 Boeing 737 700 aircraft in 2007 37 of which were new aircraft from Boeing, and two of which were pre owned and leased from a third party. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had exercised all remaining options for aircraft to be delivered in 2008, and had firm orders for 29 737 700 aircraft in 2008, 20 in 2009, 10 each in 2010 2012, and 29 thereafter. The Company also had options for 8 737 700 aircraft in 2009, 24 in 2010, 22 in 2011 and 30 in 2012. Southwest also has an additional 54 purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft for the years 2008 through 2014. The Company has the option to substitute 737 600s or 800s for the 700s. This option is applicable to aircraft ordered from Boeing and must be exercised 18 months prior to the contractual delivery date. The leasing of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating the aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for leased aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. The Company operates 95 leased aircraft, of which 86 are operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft is included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the letters of credit 26 Table of Contents are an off balance sheet item, the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $211 million at December 31, 2007. The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007: Obligations by Period 2009 2011 Beyond Contractual Obligations 2008 2010 2012 2012 Total (In millions) Long term debt(1) $ 27 $ 65 $ 451 $ 1,499 $ 2,042 Interest commitments(2) 115 229 208 556 1,108 Capital lease commitments(3) 16 32 12 60 Operating lease commitments 400 633 430 876 2,339 Aircraft purchase commitments(4) 747 839 902 684 3,172 Other purchase commitments 60 64 14 138 Total contractual obligations $ 1,365 $ 1,862 $ 2,017 $ 3,615 $ 8,859 (1) Includes current maturities, but excludes amounts associated with interest rate swap agreements (2) Related to fixed rate debt (3) Includes amounts classified as interest (4) Firm orders from Boeing There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys revolving credit facility. In January 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Companys common stock, utilizing present and anticipated proceeds from the exercise of Employee stock options. Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. This program was completed during first quarter 2005, resulting in the total repurchase of approximately 21 million of the Companys common shares. In 2006 and 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized five separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of $1.8 billion of the Companys Common Stock $300 million authorized in January 2006, $300 million authorized in May 2006, $400 million authorized in November 2006, $300 million authorized in March 2007, and $500 million authorized in May 2007. Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. These programs, the last of which was completed during third quarter 2007, resulted in the repurchase of a total of approximately 116 million shares. During January 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys Common Stock. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. 27 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The Companys Air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2007 was $931 million, compared to $799 million as of December 31, 2006. Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable) that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Holding other factors constant, a ten percent change in the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets for 2007 would have resulted in a $20 million, or .2%, change in Passenger revenues recognized for that period. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. No material adjustments were recorded for years 2005, 2006, or 2007. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting for Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $15.2 billion (at cost) of long lived assets, including $13.0 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 434 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2007, which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 86 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2007, are on operating lease. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: Estimated Residual Estimated Useful Life value Aircraft and engines 23 to 25 years 15% Aircraft parts Fleet life 4% Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10% Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term 0% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from Boeing. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. 28 Table of Contents Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required by GAAP. When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, Southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on SFAS 133, the Companys fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be reflected at market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2007, the Company was a party to over 346 financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging program, for year 2008 and beyond. The fair value of the Companys fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007, was $2.4 billion, compared to $999 million at December 31, 2006. The large increase in fair value was due primarily to the significant increase in energy prices in the second half of 2007, net of the expiration (i.e., settlement) of approximately $727 million in fuel derivative instruments that related to 2007 and net of new derivative instruments the Company added for future years. Of the remaining $2.4 billion in fair value of fuel hedging financial derivative instruments at December 31, 2007, approximately $1.1 billion is expected to settle, or expire during 2008. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically, as was evident during recent years, based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, and general economic conditions, among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the Companys ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the Company hedges. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. In recent years, 29 Table of Contents because of increased volatility in energy markets, the Companys estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated have materially differed from actual results, resulting in increased volatility in the Companys periodic financial results. For example, historical data had been utilized in qualifying unleaded gasoline for SFAS 133 hedge accounting under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would result in effective hedges, as defined. This historical data is updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether SFAS 133 hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity the Company uses in its hedging program. During 2006, based on these updates, the Company in fact lost SFAS 133 hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments, and thus has marked all such derivatives to market value in each subsequent quarterly period since that time, with all changes in value reflected as a component of Other gains/losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Although commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases, there have been instances in which the Company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities. In these instances, the Company has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes reflected in the income statement each reporting period. Although the Companys prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases still qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting in specific locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. If recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an extended period of time or worsens in the near future, the Company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil and heating oil derivatives, which would create further volatility in the Companys financial results. Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative instrument may not expire/settle until a future period. Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to Other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities, especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value of the Companys fuel derivatives and the recent volatility in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period, including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has resulted, in increased volatility in the Companys financial statements. The significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products, and the volatility of the different types of products the Company uses for protection. The number of instances in which the Company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, has increased recently, primarily due to these reasons. In these cases, the Company has determined the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the time period remaining until settlement and therefore must discontinue special hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS 133. When this happens, any changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings in the period of change. As the fair value of the Companys hedge positions can fluctuate significantly in amount from period to period, it is probable there will be continued variability recorded in the income statement and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in future periods will be material. This is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes. SFAS 133 is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements, including the documentation of a Company hedging strategy, statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis, and strict contemporaneous 30 Table of Contents documentation that is required at the time each hedge is designated by the Company. As required by SFAS 133, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis. The Company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis. This analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes. The Company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the Companys fuel hedges, as required by SFAS 133. During first quarter 2006, the Company did revise its method for forecasting these future cash flows. Prior to 2006, the Company had estimated future cash flows using actual market forward prices of a single like commodity and adjusting for historical differences from the Companys actual jet fuel purchase prices. The Company implemented an improved model for forecasting forward jet fuel prices during 2006, due to the fact that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices, depending on specific geographic locations in which the Company hedges. In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company then adjusts for certain items, such as transportation costs, that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors, in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge. This improved methodology for estimating future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) was applied prospectively, in accordance with the Companys interpretation of SFAS 133. The Company did not, however, change its method for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness. As a result of this new method for forecasting future jet fuel prices, the Company believes its hedges are more likely to be effective over the long term. The Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements. The primary objective for the Companys use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities. The Company currently holds interest rate swap agreements related to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, its $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and its $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due 2027. The interest rate swaps associated with the $300 million 5.125% notes and $100 million 7.375% debentures were entered into during 2007. The floating rate paid under the swap associated with the $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012 is set in arrears. The Company pays the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin every six months and receives 6.5 percent every six months on a notional amount of $385 million until 2012. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2007 is estimated to be 7.31 percent based on actual and forward rates at December 31, 2007. The floating rate for the swap agreement relating to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014 is set at the beginning of each six month period. Under this agreement, the Company pays LIBOR plus a margin every six months and receives 5.25 percent every six months on a notional amount of $350 million until 2014. The average floating rate paid under this agreement during 2007 was 6.02 percent. For both the swap agreements associated with the $300 million 5.125% notes and $100 million 7.375% debentures, the Company pays the LIBOR plus a margin every six months on the notional amount of the debt, and receives the fixed stated rate of the notes or debentures every six months until the date the notes or debentures become due. The average floating rate paid during 2007 under the agreement associated with the $300 million 5.125% notes due 2016 was 4.64 percent. The average floating rate paid during 2007 under the agreement associated with the $100 million 7.375% debentures due 2027 was 6.73 percent. The Companys interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. Under the shortcut method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and, thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. The fair values of the interest rate swap agreements, which are adjusted regularly, is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt. The total fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2007, was an asset of approximately $16 million. The total fair value of the swap agreements held at December 31, 2006, was a liability of $30 million. The long term portion of these amounts is recorded in Other deferred liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for each respective year. In accordance with fair value hedging, the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments, and forward jet fuel prices, would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Share Based Compensation The Company has share based compensation plans covering the majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via collective bargaining, a plan covering the Companys Board of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with the Executive Chairman of the Company. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of Employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. However, prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment using the modified retrospective transition method. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of Employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. In addition, results for prior periods were retroactively adjusted utilizing the pro forma disclosures in those prior financial statements. As part of this revision, the Company recorded cumulative share based compensation expense of $409 million for the period 1995 2005, resulting in a reduction to Retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. This adjustment, along with the creation of a net Deferred income tax asset in the amount of $130 million, resulted in an offsetting increase to Capital in excess of par value in the amount of $539 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. The Deferred tax asset represents the portion of the cumulative expense related to stock options that will result in a future tax deduction. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, certain assumptions used in the Black Scholes model, such as expected term, can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Companys stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term. For 2006 and 2007, the Company has relied on observations of historical volatility trends, implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties, and implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock. For both 2007 and 2006 stock option grants, the Company utilized expected volatility based on the expected life of the option, but within a range of 24 percent to 27 percent. Prior to 2005, the Company relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input for determining the estimated fair value of stock options. In determining the expected term of the option grants, the Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield of the Companys common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Companys current dividend yield, and adjusted for anticipated future changes. Vesting terms for the Companys stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted. For grants made to Employees under collective bargaining plans, vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement. For Other Employee Plans, options generally vest and become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of continued 32 Table of Contents employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants in any of the Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. None of the Companys grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions, as defined. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $37 million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to past grants of stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.25 years. The total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized compensation cost was approximately eight years; however, the majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two years, in accordance with vesting provisions. The majority of the $37 million in share based compensation expense reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2007, was related to options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Based on Employee stock options expected to vest during 2008, and the Companys expectation of future grants, the Company expects the expense related to share based compensation to once again decrease during 2008 compared to 2007 expense. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Recent Accounting Developments In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company is subject to the provisions of SFAS 157 beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has not yet determined whether SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. However, the Company believes it will likely be required to provide additional disclosures as part of future financial statements, beginning with first quarter 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Statement 159). Statement 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. Statement 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe Statement 159 will result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. Southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 95 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Fuel Hedging The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2008. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $15 million per year, excluding any impact of the Companys derivative instruments. The fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2007, were net assets of $2.4 billion. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $1.1 billion, is classified as Fuel derivative contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $1.3 billion, is included in Other assets. 33 Table of Contents The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2007, prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to $658 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2007, levels, except underlying futures prices. Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. The credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. At December 31, 2007, the Company had agreements with nine counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels. At December 31, 2007, the Company held $2.0 billion in cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions. These collateral deposits serve to decrease, but not totally eliminate, the credit risk associated with the Companys hedging program. The deposits are included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Market Risk The vast majority of the Companys assets are aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an A credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with Standard Poors and Fitch ratings agencies, and a Baa1 credit rating with Moodys rating agency as of December 31, 2007. In January 2008, Fitch announced a cut in the Companys senior unsecured debt rating to A. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. This includes the Companys $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, the $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and the $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due 2027. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. Excluding the notes or debentures that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Companys only fixed rate senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2007 were its $300 million notes due 2016. These senior unsecured notes have a fixed rate of 5.75 percent, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The Companys outstanding $500 million EETCs, which are secured by 16 Boeing 737 700 aircraft, had an effective fixed rate of 6.24 percent. The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $1.3 billion, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 6.1 years at floating rates averaging 5.68 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. In total, the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 6.5 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2007. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $2.2 billion, and short term investments, which totaled $566 million, at December 31, 2007. However, the Company generally does not retain the interest earnings on the $2.0 billion in cash collateral deposits from counterparties associated with the Companys fuel derivative instruments. See Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money market instruments, investment grade commercial paper, auction rate securities, and other highly rated financial instruments. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest 34 Table of Contents rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2007, would not have a material affect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash (excluding cash collateral deposits), and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2007, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $3 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance (excluding cash collateral deposits), short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007, an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement, the revolving credit facility, and outstanding debt agreements. Covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings. For the revolving credit facility, the Company must also maintain, at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 1.00 to 1.25. The Company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of December 31, 2007. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements, it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written. 35 Table of Contents
