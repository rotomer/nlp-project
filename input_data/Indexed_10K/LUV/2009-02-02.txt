Item 7. Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Year in Review For the 36th consecutive year, the Company reported a net profit, earning $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted) in 2008. In addition, the Company recorded operating profits in all four quarters of 2008, as it has now done in 71 consecutive quarters dating back to the second quarter of 1991. Given the significance of events that took place during 2008, the Companys challenge to continue these streaks was unprecedented in recent history. Demand for air travel, especially for the low fares offered by the Company, was strong during the first half of 2008 and through the summer months. However, demand for air travel waned, especially during fourth quarter 2008, which the Company believes was a result of the crisis experienced in worldwide credit markets and the domestic recessionary environment that became evident during the year. The Company was able to gradually raise fares throughout most of the year to combat an enormous increase in fuel prices; however, during the fourth quarter, the Company offered more discounted fares in order to stimulate demand as the number of people choosing to travel by air declined versus the prior year. The Companys ability to raise fares during 2008 (as well as to keep prior fare increases in place) was due in part to competitor capacity reductions in certain of the Companys markets especially beginning in September 2008, but was also aided by several Company initiatives including: a slowing of internal capacity growth at times during 2008; optimizing the flight schedule to eliminate unproductive and less popular flights and reallocating capacity to fund market growth opportunities such as Denver, and the upcoming addition of the Companys newest city, Minneapolis St. Paul (beginning service in March 2009); enhancement of revenue management technologies, processes, and techniques; and aggressive promotion of the Companys No Hidden Fees, Low Fare brand. In addition to having a significant impact on the entire U.S. economy, energy and fuel prices were again a major story for airlines during 2008. After beginning the year at approximately $100 per barrel, the price of crude oil skyrocketed to over $145 in July 2008. This caused the Company, as well as all major U.S. airlines, to reconsider growth and capacity plans for the near future, as the devastating impact of these fuel prices was evident in the financial results of all domestic airlines. The summer spike in oil prices, as well as other clearly evident deteriorating economic conditions that followed, caused the Company to modify its growth and to plan for an expected decrease in demand for air travel. Even with fuel derivative instruments in place for approximately 78 percent of the Companys fuel consumption during 2008, the Companys fuel and oil expense increased $1.0 billion versus 2007. The fuel derivative instruments the Company had in place for 2008 resulted in settlement gains of $1.3 billion (on a cash basis, before profitsharing and income taxes), which was an increase of $566 million compared to the fuel derivative cash settlement gains the Company received during 2007. As a result of the rapid collapse in energy prices during fourth quarter 2008, the Company has effectively reduced its net fuel hedge position in place for the years from 2009 through 2013 to approximately ten percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in each of those years. Due to the manner in which the Company reduced its fuel hedge for these future years (primarily by selling swap instruments, which in most cases were sold at lower prices than the positions that were previously purchased), and disregarding any future potential activity involving fuel derivative instruments, the Company has fixed some losses associated with these instruments and expects to pay higher than market prices for fuel for these periods. The market value (as of December 31, 2008) of the Companys net fuel derivative contracts for 2009 through 2013 reflects a net liability of approximately $992 million. Based on this liability at December 31, 2008 (and assuming no change to the fuel hedge portfolio), the Companys jet fuel costs per gallon would exceed market (or unhedged) prices by approximately $.16 to $.17 in each year from 2009 to 2011, $.10 in 2012, and $.08 in 2013. These estimates are based on expected future cash settlements from fuel derivatives, but exclude any Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133) impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market value because they do not qualify for special hedge accounting. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 20 Table of Contents Although the Companys 2008 net income of $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted) declined compared to 2007 net income of $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted), much of the decline was driven by a fluctuation in certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with SFAS 133, that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods. These instruments contributed net losses totaling $19 million in 2008, but had resulted in net gains totaling $360 million for 2007. Operating income for 2008 was $449 million, a 43.2 percent decrease compared to 2007. The lower 2008 operating income primarily was due to the 35.6 percent increase in the Companys average fuel cost per gallon, including hedging, which counteracted an 11.8 percent increase in operating revenues. Looking ahead to 2009, the Company remains cautious about demand for air travel given current domestic economic conditions. However, the rapid decline in fuel prices combined with the announced cutbacks in domestic capacity by major U.S. airlines, have thus far mitigated much of the impact of fewer people flying. The Company expects its net available seat mile (ASM) capacity in first quarter 2009 to be approximately four to five percent lower than first quarter 2008. However, at this same time, competitors have reduced their seats by approximately 15 percent in certain markets where they compete with the Company. The Company has announced it will start service to Minneapolis St. Paul, Minnesota, beginning in March 2009, representing the 65th city and 33rd state to which the Company flies. In addition, the Company has received initial approval to acquire 14 take off and landing slots at New Yorks LaGuardia airport from the former ATA Airlines, Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2008. Pending final approval by the bankruptcy court and closing of the transaction, which is currently expected to be in March 2009, the Company could begin flying up to seven daily roundtrips to LaGuardia as early as summer 2009. The Company also announced its intention to enter into codeshare agreements with two different airlines Canadian carrier WestJet and Mexican carrier Volaris. The Company and WestJet plan to announce codeshare flight schedules and additional features regarding the relationship by late 2009. The Company and Volaris plan to announce codeshare flight schedules and additional features regarding the relationship by early 2010. Certain details of these alliances are subject to approvals by both the U.S. and Canadian/Mexican governments. The Company is also continuing to consider codeshare opportunities with other carriers, both domestic and international. For the year 2009, the Company currently plans to reduce its fleet by a net two aircraft. The Company plans to add 13 new 737 700 aircraft from Boeing, and plans to return from lease or retire a total of fifteen aircraft. Based on current plans, the Companys fleet is scheduled to total 535 737s by the end of 2009. Results of Operations 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys net income of $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted) in 2008 represented a decrease of $467 million, or 72.4 percent, compared to its 2007 net income of $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted). The majority of the decline in net income was due to the fluctuation of certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with SFAS 133. These included adjustments impacting earnings through the recording of gains and or losses in 2008 and 2007 associated with fuel derivatives expiring in future periods, and settlement/expiration of fuel derivative instruments for cash in 2008 or 2007, but for which gains and or losses had been recorded in earnings in a prior period. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Both of these types of adjustments are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives. Adjustments associated with fuel derivative instruments and SFAS 133 included $19 million in net losses for 2008, and $360 million in net gains for 2007. These are included in Other (gains) losses, net, which is below the operating income line, in both periods. Due to the fact that items associated with SFAS 133 have resulted in large adjustments to Other (gains) losses, net, the Company believes operating income provides a better indication of the Companys financial performance for both 2008 and 2007 than does net income. The Companys 2008 operating income was $449 million, a decrease of $342 million, or 43.2 percent, compared to 2007. The majority of this decrease in 2008 was due to the substantial increase in fuel expense, despite the fact that the Company once again benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program. Entering 2008, the Company had instruments in place for over 75 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of $51 per 21 Table of Contents barrel. Even with this protection, however, the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon increased from $1.80 in 2007 to $2.44 in 2008. Operating Revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 11.8 percent, primarily due to a $1.1 billion, or 11.5 percent, increase in passenger revenues. Despite carrying approximately the same number of passengers as 2007, the Company was able to generate an 11.8 percent increase in average fares. The Company raised fares several times during 2008 in an attempt to keep up with rapidly increasing jet fuel prices. This strategy was aided by the Companys own slowdown in growth as well as significant capacity reductions by competitors in certain of the Companys markets. The Company purchased a total of 26 new Boeing 737 700 aircraft during 2008, and returned nine 737 300s from lease, resulting in the net addition of 17 aircraft for the year. This fleet growth enabled the Company to fly 3.6 percent more ASMs in 2008 versus the prior year. However, as a result of higher fares and general economic conditions, revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased only 1.6 percent, resulting in a load factor decrease of 1.4 points to 71.2 percent. As a result of the Companys management of fares, passenger revenue yield per RPM (passenger revenues divided by RPMs) increased 9.7 percent compared to 2007. Unit revenue (operating revenues divided by ASMs) also increased 7.8 percent compared to 2007 levels, primarily as a result of the higher RPM yield. Based on weak economic conditions, which are expected to persist at least in the short term, the Company had previously made the decision to further reduce its future capacity. The Company expects a four to five percent reduction in ASMs in first quarter 2009 compared to first quarter 2008 and approximately a four percent year over year decline in ASMs for full year 2009. Although recent unit revenue trends continue to be above prior year levels, there is no assurance this trend will continue. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the nations overall economy, it is difficult for the Company to precisely predict first quarter 2009 revenues. Consolidated freight revenues increased $15 million, or 11.5 percent, versus 2007. This increase primarily was due to higher rates charged for cargo and freight during 2008. The Company currently expects a slight increase in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter 2009 versus first quarter 2008, primarily due to higher rates charged. Other revenues increased $55 million, or 20.1 percent, compared to 2007. Approximately half of the increase was due to an increase in charter revenues versus 2007 as the Company flew charters that were not operated by competitors due to capacity reductions and or bankruptcy. The majority of the remainder of the increase was from higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase&reg; Visa card. The Company currently expects a slight year over year decrease in first quarter 2009 Other revenues compared to first quarter 2008 primarily due to lower expected charter revenues. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2008 increased $1.5 billion, or 16.6 percent, compared to a 3.6 percent increase in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2008 and 2007 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): 2008 2007 Increase(decrease) Percentchange Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.23 3.22 .01 .3 % Fuel and oil 3.60 2.70 .90 33.3 Maintenance materials and repairs .70 .62 .08 12.9 Aircraft rentals .15 .16 (.01 ) (6.3 ) Landing fees and other rentals .64 .56 .08 14.3 Depreciation and amortization .58 .56 .02 3.6 Other 1.34 1.28 .06 4.7 Total 10.24 9.10 1.14 12.5 % 22 Table of Contents The Companys 2008 CASM (cost per available seat mile) increased 12.5 percent compared to 2007. Approximately 80 percent of this increase was due to the increase in fuel expense, net of gains from the Companys fuel hedging program. The majority of the remainder of the increase was due to higher airport costs and maintenance expense. As a result of higher fuel prices throughout much of 2008, the Company has continued its diligent focus on improving fuel efficiency and controlling non fuel costs. The Company has implemented various technology improvements, which have improved efficiency and enabled the Company to grow headcount at either the same or a slower rate than capacity. Based on current cost trends, the Company expects first quarter 2009 unit costs to increase from first quarter 2008s 9.69 cents, excluding any impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market value because they do not qualify for special hedge accounting, primarily due to higher salaries, wages, and benefits and the continuation of higher maintenance costs. Unit costs will be negatively impacted due to the Companys decision to decrease its capacity versus first quarter 2008, as it will have similar or higher fixed costs that are spread over fewer ASMs. Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $127 million on an absolute dollar basis. Nearly the entire increase was from higher salaries and wages, primarily as a result of higher average wage rates. An increase in health and workers compensation benefits primarily caused by inflationary increases in the cost of medical care was mostly offset by a $46 million decrease in profitsharing, attributable to lower income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense excludes the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program as a result of SFAS 133. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SFAS 133 and fuel hedging. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM was basically flat compared to 2007. Salaries and wages per ASM increased primarily due to higher wage rates, but were almost completely offset by a decline in profitsharing expense per ASM, as capacity grew 3.6 percent, but profitsharing expense declined 34.7 percent versus 2007. Based on current trends, the Company expects salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2009 to slightly increase from fourth quarter 2008s unit cost of 3.32 cents, but not exceed 3.40 cents per ASM. The Companys Pilots are subject to an agreement between the Company and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), which became amendable during September 2006. The Company and SWAPA are currently in discussions on a new agreement. The Companys Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement between the Company and the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL CIO Local 556 (TWU 556), which became amendable in June 2008. The Company and TWU are currently in discussions on a new agreement. The Companys Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents are subject to an agreement between the Company and the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL CIO Local 555 (TWU 555), which became amendable in July 2008. The Company and TWU are currently in mediation. The Companys Stock Clerks are subject to an agreement between the Company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 19 (IBT Local 19), and the Companys Mechanics are subject to an agreement between the Company and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA). Both of these agreements became amendable in August 2008. The Company and AMFA reached a Tentative Agreement on behalf of the Southwest Mechanics in fourth quarter 2008, which was ratified by the Mechanics during January 2009. The Company and IBT Local 19 remain in discussions on a new agreement for the Companys Stock Clerks. The Companys Customer Service and Reservations Agents are subject to an agreement between the Company and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL CIO (IAM), which became amendable in November 2008. The Company and IAM are currently in discussions on a new agreement. The Companys Aircraft Appearance Technicians and Flight Dispatchers are subject to agreements between the Company and AMFA and the Company and the Transportation Workers of America, AFL CIO, Local 550, which will become amendable in February 2009 and November 2009, respectively. Fuel and oil expense increased $1.0 billion, or 38.0 percent, and on a per ASM basis increased 33.3 23 Table of Contents percent versus 2007. Both the dollar and the per ASM increase were driven primarily by a 35.6 percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel, including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging, and including related taxes. As a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of SFAS 133, the Company recognized net gains totaling $1.1 billion in 2008 relating to fuel derivative instruments versus $686 million of net gains recognized in 2007. Cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives were $1.3 billion in 2008 versus $727 million for 2007. The primary reason that gains recognized in Fuel and oil expense during 2008 were less than the cash settlement of fuel derivatives was due to the fact that a portion of the gains associated with these settlements had already been recognized in earnings in prior periods, as they were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for SFAS 133 special hedge accounting. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2008 increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, its aircraft engines, and its flight plans and procedures. These steps resulted in a 2.1 percent reduction in fuel gallons consumed per ASM flown for 2008 versus 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the Company holds fuel hedge positions for the years from 2009 through 2013. For each of these years, the Company has a net fuel hedge position for approximately ten percent of its currently forecasted fuel consumption for those periods. As of October 15, 2008, the Company had more significant fuel derivative positions related to these future periods, but during fourth quarter 2008, made the decision to reduce such positions to the current levels. The Company accomplished this reduced hedge by entering into additional derivative contracts through selling primarily fixed price swap derivatives. The Company believes this strategy enables it to participate in further price declines via the sold derivatives, which should materially offset further declines in value of the Companys previously purchased derivatives. This decision also benefitted the Company by reducing its exposure to cash collateral requirements the Company would be required to post with its counterparties if market prices continued to fall. Since, in many cases, fuel derivatives were sold at lower prices than the positions that were previously purchased, and disregarding any future potential activity involving fuel derivative instruments, the Company has fixed some losses associated with these instruments and currently expects to pay higher than market prices for fuel for these future periods. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 12.9 percent compared to 2007, while increasing $105 million on a dollar basis. On both a dollar basis and a per ASM basis, engine expense accounted for almost 60 percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for approximately 40 percent of the increase. The majority of the increase in engine costs related to the Companys 737 700 aircraft. For all of 2007 and the first half of 2008, these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis. During the first half of 2008, there were significantly more repair events for these engines than in the first half of 2007. This was due to the fact that the 737 700 is the newest aircraft type in the Companys fleet, and, as this fleet has matured, the number of engines on these aircraft undergoing their first major overhaul has increased. As further discussed below, in June 2008, the Company transitioned to a new engine repair agreement for these aircraft and, as noted below, expense is now based on flight hours associated with 737 700 engines. The expense for 737 700 engines recognized in the second half of 2008 associated with the current agreement also exceeded the expense recognized in the second half of 2007, when repairs were still being accounted for on a time and materials basis. The increase in airframe expense primarily was due to more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in the prior year. These events, which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown, were higher in number as well as cost per event. In June 2008, the Company transitioned from its previous 737 700 engine repair agreement with GE Engines Services, Inc. (GE Engines), under which repairs were done pursuant to a combination of fixed pricing and time and material terms, to a new agreement with GE Engines that provides for engine repairs to be done on a rate per flight hour basis. The previous agreement was set to expire in 2013, while the new agreement will expire in 2018. The new agreement covers all engines currently in the Companys 737 700 fleet as well as future firm deliveries for this aircraft type. Under this new agreement, the Company has effectively transferred risk for specified future repairs and maintenance on 24 Table of Contents these engines to the service provider and will pay GE Engines a contractual rate per hour flown, as stated in the agreement. Since expense for these engine repairs is now based on engine hours flown, as it is for the Companys 737 300 and 737 500 fleet, this new agreement allows the Company to more reliably predict future engine repair costs. Considering the new agreement, the Company expects Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM for first quarter 2009 to be similar to the .78 cents per ASM experienced in fourth quarter 2008, based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events and projected engine hours flown. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 6.3 percent and, on a dollar basis, decreased slightly. Both decreases primarily were due to the fact that the Company returned nine operating lease aircraft to lessors during 2008 while the Companys overall ASM capacity increased 3.6 percent through purchases of new aircraft from Boeing. The Company executed a sale and leaseback of five of its 737 700 aircraft during December 2008, and the leases qualified as operating leases. The Company also executed a sale and leaseback of an additional five of its 737 700 aircraft during first quarter 2009, and has determined that these leases will be classified as operating leases. As a result of these transactions, the Company currently expects rental expense per ASM for first quarter 2009 to be in the .18 cent range. Landing fees and other rentals increased $102 million on a dollar basis and increased 14.3 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2007. The majority of both the dollar increase and per ASM increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of both space increases by the Company to accommodate new flight activity and higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space. A portion of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity, as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights. As a consequence of this continued rate inflation at various airports, the Company currently expects Landing fees and other rentals per ASM in first quarter 2009 to be in the low .70 cents per ASM range. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $44 million on a dollar basis compared to 2007, and was up 3.6 percent on a per ASM basis. The dollar increase primarily was due to the 26 new 737 700 aircraft purchased during 2008. On a per ASM basis, the increase was due to a higher proportion of the Companys 2008 growth being accomplished through owned aircraft. Prior to the sale and leaseback of five aircraft executed during December 2008, the Company had purchased the 26 new aircraft received during 2008 and had returned nine previously leased aircraft back to lessors, thereby increasing the percentage of the fleet owned. Taking into account the sale and leaseback transactions completed in December 2008 and January 2009, the Company expects an increase in depreciation expense for first quarter 2009 on a per ASM basis compared to fourth quarter 2008, due to approximately the same number of owned aircraft spread over a reduced number of ASMs. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys future aircraft deliveries and Note 8 for further information on the sale and leaseback transactions. Other operating expenses increased $105 million and were up 4.7 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2007. The majority of the increases on both a dollar basis and a per ASM basis were due to an increase in revenue related costs associated with the 11.5 percent increase in passenger revenues (such as credit card processing fees). Taking into account the reclassification of fuel taxes into Fuel and oil expense as noted in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company currently expects other operating expenses on a per ASM basis for first quarter 2009 to be in the 1.50 cents range, primarily due to higher costs related to marketing and advertising initiatives. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $11 million, or 9.2 percent, primarily due to the Companys issuance of $500 million Pass Through Certificates in October 2007, the Companys borrowing under its $600 million term loan in May 2008, and its borrowing of $400 million of the available $600 million under its revolving credit facility in October 2008. These issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the Companys floating rate debt. The Company currently expects an increase in first 25 Table of Contents quarter 2009 interest expense compared to first quarter 2008, primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with borrowings in 2008. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined 50.0 percent, or $25 million, compared to 2007, due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $18 million, or 40.9 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the Companys hedging activities and SFAS 133. During the first half of 2008, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges, as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, as commodity prices rose during that period. During the second half of 2008, when commodity prices fell, the Company recorded significant losses from hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives not qualifying for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, thereby more than offsetting the gains previously recorded during the first half of the year. During 2007, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. The gains resulted from the increase in the fair value of the Companys portfolio of fuel derivative instruments as commodity prices rose. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 (In millions) Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (6 ) $ (219 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net 106 (51 ) Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (80 ) (90 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 69 58 Other 3 10 $ 92 $ (292 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 35.9 percent in 2008 from 39.0 percent in 2007. The lower 2008 rate included an $12 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net reduction related to the first quarter 2008 reversal of a 2007 revision in Illinois income tax laws. The 2007 rate included an $11 million addition to taxes from the enactment of the Illinois tax law. The Company currently expects its 2009 effective tax rate to be between 37 and 38 percent. 2007 Compared With 2006 The Companys profit of $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted) in 2007 was an increase of $146 million, or 29.3 percent, compared to its 2006 net income of $499 million ($.61 per share, diluted). However, the Companys net profit results in both 2007 and 2006 included certain gains and losses, recorded in accordance with SFAS 133, that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods. These adjustments, which are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives, are included in Other (gains) losses, which is below the operating income line, in both periods. In 2007, these adjustments totaled net gains of $360 million. For 2006, these adjustments totaled net losses of $101 million. Therefore, the Company believes operating income provides a better indication of its financial 26 Table of Contents performance for both 2007 and 2006 than does net income. The Companys 2007 operating income was $791 million, a decrease of $143 million, or 15.3 percent, compared to 2006. The decrease in operating income primarily was driven by a substantial increase in fuel expense, despite the fact that the Company once again benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program. The Company had instruments in place to protect against over 90 percent of its fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of $50 per barrel. This resulted in a $686 million reduction to Fuel and oil expense during 2007, although, even with this protection, the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon, including fuel related taxes, increased from $1.64 in 2006 to $1.80 in 2007. Although fuel prices began 2007 at moderately high levels, they quickly increased and stayed at record levels throughout most of the second half of the year. Market crude oil prices flirted with $100 per barrel several times during 2007 and market (unhedged) jet fuel prices reached higher than $2.85 per gallon during the second half of the year. Operating Revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $775 million, or 8.5 percent, primarily due to a $707 million, or 8.1 percent, increase in passenger revenues. The increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in capacity, as the Company added aircraft and flights, resulting in a 7.5 percent increase in available seat miles compared to 2006. The Company purchased a total of 37 new Boeing 737 700 aircraft during 2007, and added another two leased 737 700s from a previous owner, resulting in the addition of 39 aircraft for the year. The Company attempted to combat high fuel prices through modest fare increases. However, general economic conditions as well as significant low fare competition made it difficult to raise fares as much as the Company had done in 2006. The Companys passenger revenue yield per RPM (passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles) increased 1.2 percent compared to 2006. Unit revenue (total revenue divided by available seat miles) also increased 0.9 percent compared to 2006 levels, as a result of the higher RPM yield. Consolidated freight revenues decreased $4 million, or 3.0 percent, versus 2006. A $10 million, or 8.5 percent, increase in freight revenues, primarily resulting from higher rates, was more than offset by a $14 million decline in mail revenues. The lower mail revenues were due to the Companys decision to discontinue carrying mail for the U.S. Postal Service effective as of the end of second quarter 2006. Other revenues increased $72 million, or 35.6 percent, compared to 2006, primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase&reg; Visa card. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2007 increased $918 million, or 11.3 percent, compared to a 7.5 percent increase in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are typically driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2007 and 2006 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): 2007 2006 Increase(Decrease) PercentChange Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.22 3.29 (.07 ) (2.1 )% Fuel and oil 2.70 2.47 .23 9.3 Maintenance materials and repairs .62 .51 .11 21.6 Aircraft rentals .16 .17 (.01 ) (5.9 ) Landing fees and other rentals .56 .53 .03 5.7 Depreciation and amortization .56 .56 Other 1.28 1.27 .01 0.8 Total 9.10 8.80 .30 3.4 % The Companys 2007 CASM (cost per available seat mile) increased 3.4 percent compared to 2006. Approximately 80 percent of this increase was due to the increase in fuel expense, net of gains from the 27 Table of Contents Companys fuel hedging program. The remainder of the increase was due to higher maintenance expense. All other operating expense categories combined to be approximately flat compared to 2006. Due to higher fuel prices, the Company intensified its focus on controlling non fuel costs and continued to mitigate wage rate and benefit cost pressures through productivity and efficiency improvements. The Companys headcount per aircraft at December 31, 2007, was 66, versus a December 31, 2006 level of 68. From the end of 2003 to the end of 2007, the Companys headcount per aircraft decreased 22 percent, as it implemented various technology improvements, which improved efficiency and enabled the Company to grow capacity without a commensurate increase in headcount. On an absolute dollar basis, Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $161 million, primarily from a $204 million increase in salaries and wages, partially offset by a $43 million decrease in benefits. The dollar increase in salaries and wages primarily was due to a 5.2 percent headcount increase, and the dollar decrease in benefits primarily was due to a $33 million decrease in profitsharing, attributable to lower income available for profitsharing, and a $43 million decrease in share based compensation, due to fewer Employee stock options becoming vested during 2007 versus 2006. These benefits decreases were partially offset by higher healthcare costs. Although the Companys net income was higher than 2006, income available for profitsharing was lower, since the Companys profitsharing plan does not consider the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program as a result of SFAS 133. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM decreased 2.1 percent compared to 2006, primarily due to lower profitsharing expense and lower share based compensation expense, despite the increase in ASMs. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SFAS 133 and fuel hedging, and Note 14 for further information on share based compensation. Fuel and oil expense increased $406 million, and on a per ASM basis increased 9.3 percent versus 2006. Approximately 55 percent of the dollar increase was due to an increase in fuel prices, and the remainder was from an increase in gallons consumed to support the 7.5 percent capacity increase versus 2006. On a per ASM basis, nearly the entire increase was due to higher fuel prices. The fuel derivative instruments the Company held for 2007 were not as favorable as those held in the prior year, as they were at higher average crude oil equivalent prices than the instruments that settled/expired in 2006. Despite this, the Companys hedging program resulted in the realization of $727 million in cash settlements during 2007. These settlements generated a 2007 reduction to Fuel and oil expense of $686 million, compared to the prior year when the Companys fuel derivative instruments resulted in a $634 million reduction to Fuel and oil expense. Even with these significant hedge positions in both years, the Companys jet fuel cost per gallon increased 9.8 percent versus 2006. The average cost per gallon of jet fuel in 2007 was $1.80 compared to $1.64 in 2006, including fuel related taxes and net of hedging gains. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2007 increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, including the addition of blended winglets to all of the Companys 737 700 aircraft and a significant number of its 737 300 aircraft. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 21.6 percent compared to 2006, while increasing $148 million on a dollar basis. On a dollar basis, engine expense accounted for over 45 percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for over 43 percent of the increase. With respect to airframe expense, the Company completed significantly more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in 2006. These events, which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown, were higher in number as well as cost per event, and were also due to the ongoing transition to a new airframe maintenance program for 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft which began in 2006. In engine expense, there was a significant increase in repairs for the Companys 737 700 aircraft engines primarily due to the maturation of this fleet, which was introduced in 1997, and more repair events than expected. On a per ASM basis, approximately 48 percent of the increase in maintenance materials and repairs was a result of the higher airframe expense, and approximately 43 percent of the increase was due to the higher engine expense. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 5.9 percent and, on a dollar basis, decreased slightly. The decrease per ASM primarily was due to the fact that the Company increased overall ASMs by 7.5 percent, 28 Table of Contents but the number of aircraft on operating lease increased by only two from 2006 to 2007. The Company added 37 purchased aircraft to its fleet during 2007, and leased two additional 737 700 aircraft. Landing fees and other rentals increased $65 million on a dollar basis and 5.7 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2006. The dollar increase primarily was due to an increase in airport gate space to support the increase in capacity and trips flown versus 2006. On a per ASM basis, the increase primarily was due to higher rates paid for airport space. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $40 million on a dollar basis compared to 2006, but was flat on a per ASM basis. The dollar increase primarily was due to 37 new 737 700 aircraft purchased during 2007. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys future aircraft deliveries. Other operating expenses increased $100 million but were relatively flat on a per ASM basis, compared to 2006. On a dollar basis, over 20 percent of the increase was due to an increase in revenue related costs associated with the 8.1 percent increase in passenger revenues (such as credit card processing fees) and over 20 percent was due to higher personnel expenses (which includes items associated with flight crew travel, such as hotel and per diem costs) caused by the increase in capacity and trips flown. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased by $9 million, or 7.0 percent, primarily due to the Companys repayment of $729 million in debt during 2006 and 2007. This was partially offset by the issuance of $800 million in new debt instruments in 2006 and 2007; however, the timing of the new debt issued compared to the debt repaid resulted in lower expense for 2007. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined slightly compared to 2006 due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries. Interest income decreased $40 million, or 47.6 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average cash and short term investment balances on which the Company earns interest. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the Companys hedging activities and SFAS 133. During 2007, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they didnt qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. The gains resulted from the dramatic increase in the fair value of the Companys portfolio of fuel derivative instruments as commodity prices reached record levels. During 2006, the Company recorded losses related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges, as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they didnt qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, as commodity prices declined during that year. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 (In millions) Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (219 ) $ 42 Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net (51 ) 39 Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (90 ) 20 Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 58 52 Other 10 (2 ) $ (292 ) $ 151 See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. 29 Table of Contents Income taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 39.0 percent in 2007 from 36.8 percent in 2006. The higher 2007 rate included an $11 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net addition related to a revision in Illinois income tax laws enacted in 2007. The 2006 rate included a $9 million net reduction related to a revision in the State of Texas franchise tax law enacted during 2006. As a result of the January 2008 reversal of the 2007 Illinois tax law change, the Company reversed the previously mentioned $11 million net charge during first quarter 2008. Liquidity And Capital Resources Net cash used in operating activities was $1.5 billion in 2008 compared to $2.8 billion provided by operations in 2007. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. Operating cash flows over the past three years have also been significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions. During 2006, 2007, and the first ten months of 2008, the value of the Companys fuel derivative instruments was positive, resulting in the Company holding counterparty cash deposits at times significant amounts. These cash deposits held were reflected as an increase to Cash and a corresponding increase to Accrued liabilities. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, increases and or decreases to these cash deposits have been reflected in operating cash flows within the changes to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities line item. In late 2008, the net fair value of fuel derivative instruments held became a liability, requiring the Company to post cash collateral with a counterparty. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of cash posted with this counterparty was $240 million, and is reflected as a decrease to Cash and a corresponding increase to Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Increases or decreases to cash deposits posted to counterparties are reflected in operating cash flows within the changes to Other current assets line item. Since the amount of cash collateral deposits held by the Company at December 31, 2007 was $2.0 billion, the net change in cash deposits for 2008 was a net operating outflow of $2.2 billion. This compares to an increase in counterparty deposits (operating inflow) of $1.5 billion for 2007. The increase in these deposits during 2007 was due to the significant increase in fair value of the Companys fuel derivative portfolio from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007 (in conjunction with rising energy prices). Cash flows associated with purchasing derivatives, which are also classified as operating cash flows, were a net outflow of $418 million in 2008, but were immaterial for 2007. Cash flows from operating activities for 2008 were also driven by the $178 million in net income, plus noncash depreciation and amortization expense of $599 million. For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Operating cash generated primarily is used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2008 totaled $978 million, versus $1.5 billion used in 2007. Investing activities in both years primarily consisted of payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 26 new 737 700 aircraft in 2008 versus the purchase of 37 737 700s in 2007. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2008 and 2007 were also reduced by $55 million and $198 million, respectively, related to changes in the balance of the Companys short term investments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2008. During 2008, the Company borrowed $600 million under a Term Loan Agreement, borrowed $400 million under its revolving credit facility, sold $400 million of Secured Notes, and raised approximately $173 million from a sale and leaseback transaction involving five of the Companys 737 700 aircraft. The Company also received $117 million in proceeds from Employees exercise of stock options and $91 million from a credit line borrowing. These inflows were partially offset by the Companys repurchase of $54 million of its Common Stock, representing a total of 4.4 million shares. Net cash used in financing activities was $493 million in 2007, primarily from the Companys repurchase of $1.0 billion of its common stock. The Company repurchased a total of 66 million shares of outstanding common 30 Table of Contents stock during 2007 as a result of buyback programs authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. These uses were partially offset by the October 2007 issuance of $500 million Pass Through Certificates consisting of $412 million 6.15% Series A certificates and $88 million 6.65% Series B certificates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt. The Company recently amended one of its counterparty agreements, and the amendment became effective in January 2009. This amendment significantly reduced the Companys current exposure to cash collateral requirements. Previously, if the Company became obligated to post collateral as security for its potential obligations under the agreement, all such collateral was required to be cash. Under the amendment, until January 1, 2010, if the Company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts of up to $300 million and in excess of $700 million, the Company will continue to be required to post cash collateral; however, if the Company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts between $300 million and $700 million, the Company has pledged 20 of its Boeing 737 700 aircraft as collateral in lieu of cash. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, And Contingent Liabilities And Commitments The Company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The Company received 26 Boeing 737 700 aircraft in 2008, all of which were new aircraft from Boeing. Three additional Boeing 737 700 aircraft were scheduled to be received during 2008; however, due to a strike by machinists at Boeing during the second half of the year, these aircraft were deferred until 2009. The Company also retired nine of its older leased 737 300 aircraft during 2008 and executed a sale and leaseback transaction for five of its owned 737 700 aircraft. Due to the collapse of the credit market in 2008 and the severe economic recession, the Company evaluated its future aircraft needs based on a projected decline in demand for air travel. This led the Company to revise its future firm commitments for new aircraft from Boeing. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had reduced its firm orders to a total of 99 737 700 aircraft for the years 2009 through 2016. The Company also had reduced its options to 67 737 700 aircraft from 2010 through 2015, with an additional 54 purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft through 2018 as set forth in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2009, the Company further revised its firm orders to 104 737 700 aircraft and its options to 62 737 700 aircraft as set forth in Part I, Item 2 of this filing. The Company has the option to substitute 737 600s or 800s for the 700s. This option is applicable to aircraft ordered from Boeing and must be exercised 18 months prior to the contractual delivery date. The leasing of aircraft (including the sale and leaseback of aircraft) effectively provides flexibility to the Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating leased aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. As of December 31, 2008, the Company operated 91 leased aircraft, of which 82 are operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft is included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the letters of credit are off balance sheet, the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $222 million at December 31, 2008. 31 Table of Contents The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008: Obligations by period (in millions) Contractual obligations 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Beyond2013 Total Long term debt (1) $ 58 $ 1,028 $ 523 $ 1,879 $ 3,488 Interest commitments (2) 188 376 271 668 1,503 Capital lease commitments (3) 16 27 43 Operating lease commitments 376 573 355 728 2,032 Aircraft purchase commitments (4) 393 937 1,135 769 3,234 Other purchase commitments 50 117 52 219 Total contractual obligations $ 1,081 $ 3,058 $ 2,336 $ 4,044 $ 10,519 (1) Includes current maturities, but excludes amounts associated with interest rate swap agreements (2) Related to fixed rate debt (3) Includes amounts classified as interest (4) Firm orders from Boeing In addition to the above contractual fixed obligations, the Company also had estimated obligations at December 31, 2008, related to its fuel derivative positions for the years 2009 through 2013 (based on the contractual settlement date of those derivative instruments). Although the fair value of these positions can fluctuate significantly based on forward market prices for crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, the following table displays these estimated obligations as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total Fuel derivative obligations $ 246 $ 239 $ 236 $ 146 $ 125 $ 992 Available to the Company at December 31, 2008, was cash on hand and short term investments totaling $1.8 billion, present and future internally generated funds, and $200 million remaining under its $600 million bank revolving line of credit. The Companys October 2008 $400 million borrowing under its revolving credit facility is being used for general corporate purposes and was done in order to enhance the Companys liquidity as a result of the current instability of the credit market. Unless extended or renewed, the revolving credit facility expires and would require full repayment by August 2010. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company executed the second tranche of a sale and leaseback transaction generating approximately $173 million in cash for the Company. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements. Notwithstanding current economic conditions and the current liquidity environment, the Company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability, which should enable it to meet its 2009 capital and operating requirements. However, given the current environment, interest rates on borrowing are significantly higher than levels experienced in recent history. As of December 31, 2008, the book value of the Companys unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately $7.5 billion. Standard & Poors and Fitch both recently downgraded the Companys credit rating from A to BBB+ based on the volatility of fuel prices, current economic conditions, and a more negative assessment of the long term fundamentals of the U.S. airline industry. While the Companys credit rating remains investment grade, as defined, the lower rating will likely result in a slight increase in its borrowing costs on a prospective basis. Moodys has also recently reaffirmed the Companys Baa1 rating, which is also considered investment grade. In 2006 and 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized five separate programs for the 32 Table of Contents repurchase of up to a total of $1.8 billion of the Companys Common Stock $300 million authorized in January 2006, $300 million authorized in May 2006, $400 million authorized in November 2006, $300 million authorized in March 2007, and $500 million authorized in May 2007. Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. These programs, the last of which was completed during third quarter 2007, resulted in the repurchase of a total of approximately 116 million shares. During January 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys Common Stock. Repurchases have been and will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. The Company repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total of $54 million as part of this program through February 15, 2008; however, the Company has not repurchased any additional shares from that date through the date of this filing. The Company does not believe it is prudent to repurchase shares at the current time considering todays unstable financial markets and volatile fuel prices. Critical Accounting Policies And Estimates The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The Companys Air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2008 was $963 million, compared to $931 million as of December 31, 2007. Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable) that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Holding other factors constant, a ten percent change in the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets for 2008 would have resulted in a $21 million, or .2 percent, change in Passenger revenues recognized for that period. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or 33 Table of Contents forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, and promotional fare activity. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. No material adjustments were recorded for the years 2008, 2007, or 2006. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting For Long lived Assets As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $15.9 billion (at cost) of long lived assets, including $13.7 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 455 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2008, which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 82 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2008, are on operating lease. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: Estimated Useful Life EstimatedResidualvalue Aircraft and engines 23 to 25 years 10% 15% Aircraft parts Fleet life 4% Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10% Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term 0% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types, current and projected future market information, and recommendations from Boeing. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required by GAAP. When appropriate, the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, the company has continued to operate all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce profits. consequently, the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices, and accounts for them 34 Table of Contents under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on SFAS 133, the Companys fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be reflected at market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2008, the Company was a party to over 536 financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging program, for the years from 2009 through 2013. The fair value of the Companys fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008, was a net liability of $992 million, compared to an asset of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2007. The large decrease in fair value primarily was due to the significant decrease in energy prices in the fourth quarter of 2008, net of the expiration (i.e., settlement in which the Company received cash proceeds) of approximately $1.3 billion in fuel derivative instruments that related to 2008 and net of new derivative instruments the Company added for future years. Of the $992 million liability in fair value of fuel hedging financial derivative instruments at December 31, 2008, approximately $246 million is expected to settle, or expire during 2009. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically, as was evident during 2008, based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. During 2008, market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of over $147 per barrel and hit a low price of under $35 per barrel both within a period of approximately five months. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, and general economic conditions, among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices, as required by SFAS 133. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the Companys ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the Company hedges. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. In recent years, because of increased volatility in energy markets, the Companys estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated have materially differed from actual results, resulting in increased volatility in the Companys periodic financial results. For example, historical data had been utilized in qualifying unleaded gasoline for SFAS 133 hedge accounting under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would result in effective hedges, as defined. This historical data is updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether SFAS 133 hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity the Company uses in its hedging program. Based on these updates, in certain prior periods, the Company has in fact lost SFAS 133 hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments. At such times, the Company has marked all such derivatives to market value in each quarterly period, with all changes in value reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Although 35 Table of Contents commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases, there have been instances in which the Company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities. In these instances, the Company has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes reflected in the income statement each reporting period. Although the Companys prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases still qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting in specific locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. If recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an extended period of time or worsens in the near future, the Company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil and heating oil derivatives, which would create further volatility in the Companys financial results. Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under SFAS 133. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result, as defined by SFAS 133. This could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative instrument may not expire/settle until a future period. Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to Other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities, especially given the recent volatility in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period, including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has resulted, in increased volatility in the Companys financial statements. The significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products, and the volatility of the different types of products the Company uses for protection. The number of instances in which the Company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, has increased in recent years, primarily due to these reasons. Depending on the level at which the Company is hedged at any point in time, as the fair value of the Companys hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period, there could be continued variability recorded in the income statement, and furthermore, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material. This is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large dollar volumes. The Company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the Companys fuel hedges, as required by SFAS 133. The current methodology used by the Company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices, depending on specific geographic locations in which the Company hedges. In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company then adjusts for certain items, such as transportation costs, that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors, in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge. This methodology for estimating future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) has been consistently applied during 2008, 2007, and 2006, in accordance with the Companys interpretation of SFAS 133. The Company also has not changed its method for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods. 36 Table of Contents At times, the Company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements. Prior to 2008, the Company had entered into interest rate swap agreements related to its $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, its $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and its $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due 2027. The primary objective for the Companys use of these interest rate hedges was to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. In addition, these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. Under the shortcut method, the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective, and, thus, there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings. During 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement concurrent with its entry into a twelve year, $600 million floating rate Term Loan Agreement. Under this swap agreement, which is accounted for as a cash flow hedge, the interest rate on the term loan is essentially fixed for its entire term at 5.223 percent and ineffectiveness is required to be measured each reporting period. The fair values of the Companys interest rate swap agreements are adjusted regularly and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the interest rate hedge is accounted for as a fair value hedge, the corresponding offsetting adjustment is to the carrying value of the long term debt. For the interest rate hedge accounted for as a cash flow hedge, the corresponding offsetting adjustment is to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of appropriate taxes. The total fair value of all interest rate swap agreements, excluding accrued interest, at December 31, 2008, was an asset of approximately $81 million. The total fair value of the swap agreements held at December 31, 2007, was an asset of $16 million. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments, and forward jet fuel prices, would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Share Based Compensation The Company has previously awarded share based compensation pursuant to plans covering the majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via collective bargaining, a plan covering the Companys Board of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with the Chairman Emeritus of the Company. The Company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize the cost of Employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, certain assumptions used in the Black Scholes model, such as expected term, can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Companys stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term. In estimating expected stock price volatility at the time of a particular stock option grant, the Company relies on observations of historical volatility trends, implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties, and implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock. For 2008, 2007, and 2006 option grants, the Company has consistently utilized a weighted average approach that calculates expected volatility using two thirds implied volatility and one third historical volatility. In determining the expected term of the option grants, the Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield of the 37 Table of Contents Companys common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Companys current dividend yield, and adjusted for anticipated future changes. Vesting terms for the Companys stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted. For grants made to Employees under collective bargaining plans, vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement. For grants to other Employees, options generally vest and become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of continued employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants in any of the Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. None of the Companys grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions, as defined. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Fair value measurements The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157) effective January 1, 2008. The Company has determined that it utilizes unobservable (Level 3) inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, these included auction rate security investments, valued at $200 million, a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts, which were a net liability of $864 million, and $8 million in other investments. All of the Companys auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2008, approximately $109 million of these instruments are classified as available for sale securities and $91 million are classified as trading securities. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 30 35 days for most securities, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1 under SFAS 157. However, due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter 2008, the auction events for most of these instruments failed, and, therefore, the Company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of December 31, 2008. In addition, the Company obtained an independent valuation of a selected number of auction rate security instruments and has considered these valuations in determining estimated fair values of other similar instruments within its portfolio. The Companys analyses consider, among other items, the collateralization underlying the security investments, the expected future cash flows, including the final maturity, associated with the securities, and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value. These securities were also compared, when possible, to other securities not owned by the Company, but with similar characteristics. Due to these events, the Company reclassified these instruments as Level 3 during first quarter 2008. In association with this estimate of fair value, the Company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of $11 million, with an offsetting entry to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Given the quality and backing of the Companys auction rate securities held, the fact that the Company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments, and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments in the periodic auction process, it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary. These conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods. The Company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the U.S. Government. In addition, for the $109 million in instruments classified as available for sale, these auction rate securities represented approximately six percent of the Companys total cash, cash equivalent, and investment balance at December 31, 2008, which it believes allows it sufficient time for the securities to return to full value. For the $91 million in instruments classified as trading securities, the Company has entered into an agreement with the counterparty that allows the Company to put the 38 Table of Contents instruments back to the counterparty at full par value in June 2010. As part of this agreement, the Company has entered into a line of credit in which it has received a $91 million loan that is secured by the auction rate security instruments from that counterparty. At the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter 2008, the Company held a total of $463 million in securities. Since that time, the Company has been able to sell $252 million of these instruments at par value, in addition to the $91 million subject to the agreement to be sold at par in June 2010. The Company is also in discussions with other counterparties to determine whether mutually agreeable decisions can be reached regarding the effective repurchase of its remaining securities. The Company determines the value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing a standard option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are quoted by its counterparties. In situations where the Company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties, it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared. The Company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds. Due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable (primarily volatility), as defined in SFAS 157, the Company has categorized these option contracts as Level 3. As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, any changes in the fair values of fuel derivative instruments are subject to the requirements of SFAS 133. Any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective, as defined, are offset within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the period in which the expected cash flow impacts earnings. Any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective, as defined, or do not qualify for special hedge accounting, are reflected in earnings within Other (gains)/losses, net, in the period of the change. Because the Company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds, and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash, the Company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the Companys derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the Companys financial statements. In addition, the Company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements, which provide for parties (or the Company) to provide cash collateral when the fair values of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels. Since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the Companys outstanding fuel derivative contracts, this provides further validation to the Companys estimate of fair values. Item 7A. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet, and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. The Company has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 91 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Fuel hedging The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. 39 Table of Contents The Company expects to consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2009. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $15 million per year, excluding any impact of the Companys derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2008, the Company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that effectively represented a hedge of approximately ten percent of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from 2009 through 2013. Prior to fourth quarter 2008, the Company had held fuel derivative instruments for a much larger portion of its anticipated fuel purchases for these years; however, due to the recent precipitous decline in fuel prices, the Company significantly reduced its hedge in order to minimize fuel hedging losses related to further oil price declines and to minimize the potential for the Company to provide additional cash collateral deposits to counterparties. The Company accomplished this reduced hedge by entering into additional derivative contracts through selling primarily fixed price swap derivatives. The Company believes this strategy enables it to participate in further price declines via the sold derivatives, which should materially offset further declines in value of the Companys previously purchased derivatives. The total net fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2008, was a net liability of $992 million. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $246 million, is classified as a component of Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $746 million, is included in Other deferred liabilities. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2008 (for all years from 2009 through 2013), prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to approximately $90 million. Changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2008, levels, except underlying futures prices. The Companys credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the Company at the reporting date. At such times, these outstanding instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, in such cases, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations and has not experienced any significant credit loss as a result of counterparty nonperformance in the past. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. However, if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the Company and were unable to meet their obligations, any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination, which could result in substantial losses for the Company. At December 31, 2008, the Company had agreements with eight counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had active portfolios with three of these counterparties. Based on the Companys current investment grade credit rating, for one counterparty, these collateral provisions require cash deposits to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with that counterparty exceed a specific threshold cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the Company, or posted by the Company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the Company. During fourth quarter 2008, the modification of the Companys fuel hedge portfolio, in combination with the amendment to one of the Companys counterparty agreements that became effective in January 2009, significantly reduced the Companys current exposure to cash collateral requirements. Prior to the amendment, if the Company became 40 Table of Contents obligated to post collateral as security for its potential obligations under this counterparty agreement, all such collateral was required to be cash. Under the agreement, as amended, until January 1, 2010, if the Company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts of up to $300 million and in excess of $700 million, the Company will continue to be required to post cash collateral; however, if the Company becomes obligated to post collateral for obligations in amounts between $300 million and $700 million, the Company has pledged 20 of its Boeing 737 700 aircraft as collateral in lieu of cash. As of January 20, 2009, assuming no changes to the Companys current net fuel hedge position, the forward market price of crude oil would have to fall to approximately $10 per barrel for each year from 2009 to 2013 before the Company would exceed the $700 million threshold that would require additional cash collateral beyond the initial $300 million level. At December 31, 2008, the Company had posted $240 million in cash collateral deposits with a counterparty under these bilateral collateral provisions. The deposits are classified as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial market risk The vast majority of the Companys assets are aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions. While the Company uses financial leverage, it has maintained a strong balance sheet and a BBB+ rating with Fitch and Standard & Poors, and a Baa1 credit rating with Moodys as of December 31, 2008. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. This includes the Companys $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, the $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and the $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due 2027. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. 41 Table of Contents Excluding the notes or debentures that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Companys only fixed rate senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2008 were its $300 million notes due 2016. These senior unsecured notes have a fixed rate of 5.75 percent, which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The following table displays the characteristics of the Companys secured fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2008: Principalamount(in millions) Effectivefixed rate Finalmaturity Underlying collateral Secured Notes $ 400 10.500 % 12/15/2011 17 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Pass Through Certificates 500 6.240 % 8/1/2022 16 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 600 5.223 % 5/9/2020 21 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $1.4 billion, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 6.9 years at floating rates averaging 4.0 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. In total, the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 14.7 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2008. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.4 billion, and short term investments, which totaled $435 million, at December 31, 2008. See Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money market instruments, investment grade commercial paper, auction rate securities, and other highly rated financial instruments, depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements. However, as a result of recent turmoil in credit markets, the Company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2008, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash (excluding cash collateral deposits held, if applicable), and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2008, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $3 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance (excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties, if applicable), short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility, and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements, its outstanding debt agreements, and some of its hedging counterparty agreements. Certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings. For the revolving credit facility, of which $400 million of the available $600 million had been drawn as of December 31, 2008, the Company must also maintain, at all times, a Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 1.25 to 1.00. The Company met this condition as of December 31, 2008. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreement, there could be a reduction in 42 Table of Contents the availability of cash under the agreement, or an increase in the costs to keep the agreement intact as written. Two of the Companys hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the Companys credit rating falls below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies. As of December 31, 2008, there was no cash posted with these counterparties. Given the Companys net fuel hedge liability with these counterparties at December 31, 2008, and assuming its credit rating were below investment grade as of that date, the Company would have been required to post approximately $700 million in cash collateral deposits with the counterparties. However, these cash collateral deposit requirements would be correspondingly reduced as the underlying fuel derivative instruments settle including by approximately $244 million in 2009. The Company currently has processing agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its Customers utilizing American Express, Discover and MasterCard/VISA. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the Company soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor would have liability if the Company does not ultimately provide the air travel. Under these processing agreements, and based on specified conditions, increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty. A majority of the Companys sales transactions are processed by Chase Paymentech. Should chargebacks processed by Chase Paymentech reach a certain level, proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur. Additionally, cash reserves are required to be established if the Companys credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade. Cash reserve requirements are based on the Companys public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the Companys Air traffic liability. As of December 31, 2008 the Company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements. However, the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The Company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future. 43 Table of Contents
