Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations YEAR IN REVIEW For the 37th consecutive year, the Company reported a net profit, earning $99 million ($.13 per share, diluted) in 2009, as compared to 2008 net profit of $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted). Although the Companys 2009 results were unfavorable compared to its 2008 results and to its historical profitability standards, the Company believes the achievement of a profit in 2009 was a tremendous accomplishment given the enormity of challenges faced by the airline industry during the year. The year 2009 began amidst the backdrop of an unprecedented worldwide credit crisis and a significant economic recession. Although fuel prices were lower on average than in 2008, prices remained much higher than long term historical averages, which forced all airlines to make major adjustments to their operations and business models. The Companys response included initiatives designed to increase unit revenues including an overall reduction in capacity and elimination of unprofitable flights, targeted marketing campaigns to enhance the Companys already strong Brand and Customer Experience, improved revenue management processes, and new service offerings such as EarlyBird Check in and the Companys Pets Are Welcome on Southwest (PAWS) products. The Company also introduced initiatives to reduce costs, including right sizing headcount. As a result of prevailing economic conditions in the second half of 2008, which persisted throughout 2009, most U.S. commercial air carriers significantly reduced domestic capacity in an attempt to match the level of anticipated demand. This included the Company, which retired older aircraft, postponed deliveries of new aircraft, and modified its operations, resulting in a 5.1 percent reduction in available seat miles flown in 2009 versus 2008. However, the Company was able to stimulate a significant amount of demand through fare sales, through its Bags Fly Free advertising campaign, and through optimizing its flight schedule. These efforts produced a significant improvement in load factors and unit revenue trends during the second half of the year. In the first half of 2009, the Company had monthly unit revenue trends that approached year over year declines of up to ten percent. By the end of 2009, however, the Company was experiencing moderate improvements in unit revenues compared to 2008, including a fourth quarter year over year improvement of almost seven percent, which outperformed the industry. The Company attributes a significant portion of this improvement to several key initiatives, including its decision to not charge for a Customers first or second checked bag, as nearly all other domestic carriers have done; a new and improved website at southwest.com; significant advancements in the Companys revenue management and network optimization capabilities, which include trimming unproductive and less popular flights and reallocating capacity to fund other market growth opportunities, such as Minneapolis St. Paul, New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan, and Milwaukee, all of which were new destinations for the Company in 2009; new products such as EarlyBird and PAWS; and aggressive discounting of fares, which stimulated demand and resulted in Company record load factors in every month from July through December 2009. On the cost front, lower fuel expense almost exactly offset the reduction in revenues experienced by the Company during 2009. However, fuel prices began the year at much lower levels than they were at the end of 2009. The market price of spot crude oil hit a low of $33 per barrel during first quarter 2009, but rose throughout the year to hit a high of $82 per barrel during fourth quarter 2009. The Company also executed Freedom 09 during the year, which was a voluntary early retirement program that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. This resulted in a one time charge of $66 million (before the impact of profitsharing or taxes) during 2009. The program was offered to decrease overstaffing created by the Companys prior decision to reduce its capacity during 2009, and the Company currently expects savings in subsequent years to exceed the cost of the program. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company carefully managed its fleet during 2009 and ended the year with 537 aircraft in active service the same with which it started the year. A total of 13 new Boeing 737 700s were delivered to the Company during 2009, and the Company removed 13 older 737 300s from active service. 24 Table of Contents Looking ahead to 2010, the Company remains cautious about demand for domestic air travel given current domestic economic conditions. Although unit revenue trends have improved recently, this improvement primarily has been through capacity reductions and other revenue initiatives, and the Company has not experienced a significant increase in the demand for full fare tickets. In addition, fuel prices continue to be volatile and remain much higher than long term historical averages. In October 2009, the Company announced its decision to begin service from Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport near Panama City, Florida in May 2010. This will represent the Companys 69th destination, and it believes it will continue to have opportunities to add more new cities in the future. The Company also plans to continue efforts to implement its previously announced codeshare agreements with two different airlines Canadian carrier WestJet and Mexican carrier Volaris. Flight schedules and additional features regarding these relationships are expected to be announced in 2010. However, certain details of these alliances are subject to approvals by both the U.S. and Canadian/Mexican governments. The Company currently anticipates another year of little or no change in its overall fleet size for 2010. The Company anticipates it will receive ten new 737 700 deliveries from Boeing during 2010 and currently plans to retire a similar number of older 737 300s, resulting in approximately flat ASMs compared to 2009. However, if there is a significant improvement in demand which includes the return of full fare traffic, the Company believes it has the flexibility to alter its current plans and to resume growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 compared with 2008 The Companys net income of $99 million ($.13 per share, diluted) in 2009 represented a decrease of $79 million, or 44.4 percent, compared to its 2008 net income of $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted). The results in each year were significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the Companys hedging activities. As a result of the fuel hedges the Company had in place during 2009 including those that settled during 2009 and those that will settle in future years the Company recognized a net total of $408 million in losses allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2008, the Company had recognized a total of $1.0 billion in net gains as a result of its fuel hedging activities, allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net. Each of these totals for 2009 and 2008 includes the net premium costs the Company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which is classified as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments. Due to the fact that the Companys fuel hedging activities have resulted in large noncash adjustments to Other (gains) losses, net, the Company believes operating income provides a better indication of the Companys financial performance for both 2009 and 2008 than does net income. The Companys 2009 operating income was $262 million, a decrease of $187 million, or 41.6 percent, compared to 2008. Although the fluctuations in Passenger revenue and Fuel and oil expense in 2009 versus 2008 were the largest individual components impacting operating income, the year over year decline in Passenger revenues almost exactly offset the year over year decline in Fuel and oil expense. Excluding these two components, the majority of the $187 million decline in operating income for 2009 versus 2008 was due to an increase in Salaries, wages, and benefits. Operating revenues Consolidated operating revenues decreased $673 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to a $657 million, or 6.2 percent, decrease in passenger revenues. The majority of the decline in passenger revenues was attributable to a 7.4 percent decrease in passenger revenue yields (passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles or RPMs), as the percentage of full fare bookings was down versus the prior year and the Company offered more fare sales and discounted seats in response to the decline in demand for air travel amid domestic economic conditions. However, as a result of the Companys fare discounting efforts and a number of recently implemented revenue initiatives, combined with a 5.1 percent reduction in ASMs, load factor increased 4.8 points to 76.0 percent in 2009, which was a record for the Company. The higher load factor mostly offset the decline in passenger yield, resulting in only a net 1.0 percent decline in operating revenue yield per ASM (unit revenue) versus 2008. 25 Table of Contents The recent revenue initiatives implemented by the Company have enabled it to partially offset the loss of full fare traffic versus the prior year and thus minimize the year over year decline in unit revenues. During 2009, the Company launched a new and improved website at southwest.com, introduced EarlyBird check in, which allows Customers to pay $10 to automatically get an assigned boarding position before general check in begins, introduced new fees for unaccompanied minors and for pets, and continued to optimize its schedule and tout its Bags Fly Free campaign. The Company believes these and other planned programs and processes will create substantial opportunities for future revenue growth. Based on results thus far in January 2010 and current booking trends for the remainder of the quarter, the Company expects a year over year increase in unit revenues for first quarter 2010. Consolidated freight revenues decreased $27 million, or 18.6 percent, versus 2008. This decrease primarily was due to fewer shipments as a result of the recent worldwide recession. This prevented the Company from being able to increase its shipping rates during 2009. During the majority of 2008, better economic conditions enabled the Company to increase its shipping rates when fuel prices were rising. The Company currently expects a slight increase in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter 2010 versus first quarter 2009, primarily due to an anticipated increase in shipments. Other revenues increased $11 million, or 3.3 percent, compared to 2008. The majority of the increase was due to revenues from recent initiatives, such as recently implemented fees for unaccompanied minors and for pets, revenue from the Companys EarlyBird initiative, and an increase in the fee charged for Customers checking a third bag. The Company expects Other revenues for first quarter 2010 to also exceed first quarter 2009, due to these recently implemented revenue initiatives. Operating expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2009 decreased $486 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to a 5.1 percent decrease in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2009 and 2008 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): 2009 2008 Increase(decrease) Percentchange Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.54 3.23 .31 9.6 % Fuel and oil 3.11 3.60 (.49 ) (13.6 ) Maintenance materials and repairs .73 .70 .03 4.3 Aircraft rentals .19 .15 .04 26.7 Landing fees and other rentals .73 .64 .09 14.1 Depreciation and amortization .63 .58 .05 8.6 Other 1.36 1.34 .02 1.5 Total 10.29 10.24 .05 .5 % The Companys 2009 CASM (cost per available seat mile) was up slightly from 2008, increasing by a net ..5 percent. However, 2009 operating expense included the impact of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company, which resulted in a $66 million charge recorded during third quarter 2009. Excluding the impact of this charge, 2009 CASM was flat compared to 2008 as lower fuel costs were offset by higher airport costs and by higher wage rates paid to nearly all Employee groups. Based on current cost trends and an estimated five to six percent decline in first quarter year over year capacity, the Company anticipates first quarter 2010 unit costs, excluding fuel, to exceed fourth quarter 2009s unit cost of 7.45 cents and is expecting the year over year increase to exceed the 8.6 percent year over year increase the Company experienced in fourth quarter 2009. Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $128 million on an absolute dollar basis, including the $66 million charge recorded during third quarter 2009 as a result of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. Excluding the impact of the Freedom 09 charge, the majority 26 Table of Contents of the year over year increase was from higher salaries and wages, primarily as a result of higher average wage rates. This was partially offset by a $53 million decrease in profitsharing, attributable to lower income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense excludes the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel hedging. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM was 9.6 percent higher than 2008, primarily due to the fact that the Companys unionized workforce, who make up the majority of its Employees, had pay scale increases as a result of increased seniority, while the Companys ASM capacity declined 5.1 percent compared to 2008. Based on current cost trends and headwinds from lower capacity, the Company expects salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2010 to be higher than fourth quarter 2009s unit cost of 3.66 cents. The Companys Stock Clerks are subject to an agreement between the Company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 19 (IBT Local 19). This agreement became amendable in August 2008. The Company and IBT Local 19 reached a Tentative Agreement on behalf of the Southwest Stock Clerks in fourth quarter 2009, which will be voted on during 2010. The Companys Aircraft Appearance Technicians and Dispatchers are subject to agreements between the Company and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) and the Company and the Transportation Workers of America, AFL CIO, Local 550 (TWU 550), which became amendable in February 2009 and November 2009, respectively. The Company is currently in discussions on new agreements with both AMFA and TWU 550. Fuel and oil expense decreased $669 million, or 18.0 percent, and on a per ASM basis decreased 13.6 percent versus 2008. Both the dollar and the per ASM decrease were driven primarily by a 13.1 percent decrease in the average price per gallon for jet fuel, including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging, and including related taxes. As a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of the accounting requirements for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognized net losses totaling $467 million in 2009 in Fuel and oil expense relating to fuel derivative instruments versus $1.1 billion of net gains recognized in Fuel and oil expense in 2008. These totals are inclusive of cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives, which were $245 million paid to counterparties in 2009 versus $1.3 billion received from counterparties for 2008. Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, there were net losses recognized in Fuel and oil expense, of $222 million and $188 million, respectively, due to the fact that the Company had previously recognized gains associated with settling contracts in each period that were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for special hedge accounting. However, these totals exclude gains and or losses recognized from hedge ineffectiveness, which are recorded as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, the Company also continued to make progress in improving the fuel efficiency of its fleet. Despite the large increase in load factor from 2008 to 2009, the Company was able to produce the same fuel gallons consumed per ASM flown for each year. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had fuel derivative instruments in place to provide coverage on a large portion of its 2010 estimated fuel consumption at varying price levels. The Company had derivative contracts in place for approximately 50 percent of its estimated 2010 fuel consumption at prices up to approximately $100 per barrel of crude oil. The Company also recently sold crude oil call options, which decreased its protection to effectively 20 percent of estimated consumption if market prices settle in the $100 to $120 per barrel range. The Company also added another layer of purchased crude oil call options to increase its protection to approximately 40 percent of estimated 2010 consumption if market prices exceed $120 per barrel. In addition to these positions, the Company also had unsettled fuel derivative instruments relating to its expected fuel consumption in 2011 through 2013. The Companys fuel derivative portfolio consists of both instruments that were entered into (up until mid 2008) to hedge future jet fuel purchases, and instruments entered into to offset the majority of these original positions when market prices plummeted in the second half of 2008 and in early 2009. The decision to offset this original portfolio also benefitted the Company by reducing its exposure to cash collateral requirements the Company would be required to post with its counterparties if market prices continued to fall. When the Company 27 Table of Contents entered into these offsetting positions, the Company undesignated the majority of its original hedges and began to mark those positions to market along with the offsetting positions. However, the Company continues to have significant amounts frozen in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) from the time that this original hedge portfolio received special hedge accounting, and these amounts will be recognized in the income statement in future periods when the underlying fuel derivative contracts settle. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has deferred losses in AOCI of $580 million, net of tax, related to fuel derivative contracts. The estimated fair market value (as of December 31, 2009) of the Companys net fuel derivative contracts for 2010 through 2013 reflects a net pretax liability of approximately $147 million, including the effect of $330 million in cash collateral that had been provided to counterparties as of December 31, 2009, which has been netted against the Companys liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table displays the Companys estimated fair value of remaining fuel derivative contracts (not considering the impact of the $330 million in cash collateral provided to counterparties) as well as the amount of deferred losses in AOCI at December 31, 2009, and the expected future periods in which these items are expected to settle and or be recognized in earnings (in millions): Year Fair value(liability) of fuelderivative contractsat December 31, 2009 Amount of(losses) deferredin AOCIat December 31,2009 (net of tax) 2010 $ (124 ) $ (237 ) 2011 $ (114 ) $ (136 ) 2012 $ (109 ) $ (101 ) 2013 $ (130 ) $ (106 ) Total $ (477 ) $ (580 ) Based on forward market prices and the amounts in the above table (and excluding any other subsequent changes to the fuel hedge portfolio), the Companys jet fuel costs per gallon are expected to exceed market (i.e., unhedged) prices during each of these periods. This is based primarily on expected future cash settlements associated with fuel derivatives, but excludes any impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market value because they do not qualify for special hedge accounting. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Based on forward market prices as of January 20, 2010, and considering only the expected net cash payments related to hedges that will settle in first quarter 2010, the Company estimates its jet fuel price per gallon, including taxes, will be approximately $2.35 for first quarter 2010. Assuming no changes to the Companys current 2010 fuel derivative portfolio, and considering only the expected net cash payments related to hedges that will settle in 2010, the Company is providing a sensitivity table for first quarter and full year 2010 jet fuel prices at different crude oil assumptions as of January 20, 2010, and for expected premium costs associated with settling contracts each period.

On a dollar basis, an increase in engine expense was mostly offset by a decrease in airframe expense. The majority of the increase in engine costs related to the Companys 737 700 aircraft, which for the second half of 2008 and all of 2009 were accounted for under an agreement with GE Engines Services, Inc. (GE Engines) that provides for engine repairs to be done on a rate per flight hour basis. For the first half of 2008, these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis and there were very few repair events. The expense for 737 700 engines recognized in 2009 associated with the current agreement exceeded the expense recognized in 2008. Under this engine agreement, which is similar to the power by the hour agreement with GE Engines the Company has in place for its 737 300 and 737 500 fleet, payments are primarily based on a rate per flight hour basis. Since the Company has effectively transferred the risk for specified future repairs and maintenance on these engines to the service provider, expense is recorded commensurate with each hour flown on an engine. The decrease in airframe expense primarily was due to a decline in the number of scheduled airframe maintenance events versus 2008. On a per ASM basis, the increase in maintenance materials and repairs compared to 2008 primarily was due to the increase in 737 700 engine costs combined with the Companys 5.1 percent decline in ASMs. The Company expects Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM for first quarter 2010 to exceed the .76 cents per ASM experienced in first quarter 2009, based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events and projected engine hours flown. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM increased 26.7 percent and, on a dollar basis, increased $32 million. Both increases primarily were due to the fact that the Company executed sale and leaseback transactions for a total of 16 of its 737 700 aircraft during December 2008 and the first half of 2009, combined with the impact of the Companys 5.1 percent ASM reduction for 2009 compared to 2008. All of the lease agreements executed as part of the sale and leaseback transactions were classified as operating leases. As a result of these transactions, the Company currently expects rental expense per ASM for first quarter 2010 to be similar to the .20 cents per ASM experienced in fourth quarter 2009. Landing fees and other rentals increased $56 million on a dollar basis and increased 14.1 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2008. The majority of both the dollar increase and per ASM increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space. The majority of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity (which in most cases exceeded the Companys capacity reductions at those airports), as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights. As a consequence of continued rate inflation at various airports, the Company currently expects Landing fees and other rentals per ASM in first quarter 2010 to be in the mid .80 cents per ASM range. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17 million on a dollar basis compared to 2008, and was up 8.6 percent on a per ASM basis. The increase on a dollar basis primarily was due to higher owned aircraft depreciation expense, primarily due to a reduction in the estimated salvage values of owned aircraft that were recently retired or are expected to be retired over the next two years, based on current and expected future market conditions for used aircraft. This increase in expense was mostly offset by the execution of sale and leaseback agreements for 11 previously owned 737 700s during the first half of 2009. The increase on a per ASM basis primarily was due to the fact that the Companys fleet size remained constant, while it reduced the number of ASMs flown as a result of economic conditions. For first quarter 2010, the Company expects Depreciation expense per ASM to increase slightly from fourth quarter 2009s .66 cents. Other operating expenses decreased $48 million, but were up 1.5 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2008. Approximately 29 percent of the decrease on a dollar basis was due to lower bad debt expense related to revenues from credit card sales, and another 28 percent of the decrease was due to lower personnel expenses, primarily due to the reduction in headcount, the Companys decline in capacity versus 2008, and other cost reduction efforts. On a per ASM basis, the increase in operating expenses per ASM primarily was due to an increase in advertising expense compared to 2008 combined with the reduction in ASMs. The Company currently expects other operating expenses on a per ASM basis for first quarter 2010 to be slightly higher than the 1.47 cents experienced in fourth quarter 2009. 29 Table of Contents Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $56 million, or 43.1 percent, primarily due to new debt issuances, including the Companys December 2008 issuance of $400 million of secured notes, its borrowing under its $332 million term loan in May 2009, and its July 2009 $124 million borrowing under a term loan agreement. These issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the Companys floating rate debt. The Company currently expects a decrease in first quarter 2010 interest expense compared to fourth quarter 2009, primarily due to lower floating interest rates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined 16.0 percent, or $4 million, compared to 2008, due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $13 million, or 50.0 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the Companys hedging activities. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: (In millions) 2009 2008 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (73 ) $ (6 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net (97 ) 106 Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (38 ) (80 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 148 69 Other 6 3 $ (54 ) $ 92 See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 39.6 percent in 2009 from 35.9 percent in 2008. The lower 2008 rate included a $12 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net reduction related to the first quarter 2008 reversal of a 2007 revision in Illinois income tax laws. The 2009 rate also includes the impact of slightly higher effective state income tax rates. The Company currently expects its 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 40 percent. 2008 compared with 2007 The Companys net income of $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted) in 2008 represented a decrease of $467 million, or 72.4 percent, compared to its 2007 net income of $645 million ($.84 per share, diluted). The majority of the decline in net income was due to the fluctuation of certain gains and losses recorded in association with fluctuations in value of the Companys fuel hedge portfolio. These included adjustments impacting earnings through the recording of gains and or losses in 2008 and 2007 associated with fuel derivatives expiring in future periods, and settlement/expiration of fuel derivative instruments for cash in 2008 or 2007, but for which gains and or losses had been recorded in earnings in a prior period. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Both of these types of adjustments are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives. Adjustments associated with fuel derivative instruments included $19 million in net losses for 2008, and $360 million in net gains for 2007. These are 30 Table of Contents included in Other (gains) losses, net, which is below the operating income line, in both periods. Due to the fact that the fluctuation in value of the Companys hedge portfolio has resulted in large adjustments to Other (gains) losses, net, the Company believes operating income provides a better indication of the Companys financial performance for both 2008 and 2007 than does net income. The Companys 2008 operating income was $449 million, a decrease of $342 million, or 43.2 percent, compared to 2007. The majority of this decrease in 2008 was due to the substantial increase in fuel expense, despite the fact that the Company benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program. Entering 2008, the Company had instruments in place for over 75 percent of its anticipated fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of $51 per barrel. Even with this protection, however, the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon increased from $1.80 in 2007 to $2.44 in 2008. Operating revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 11.8 percent, primarily due to a $1.1 billion, or 11.5 percent, increase in passenger revenues. Despite carrying approximately the same number of passengers as 2007, the Company was able to generate an 11.8 percent increase in average fares. The Company raised fares several times during 2008 in an attempt to keep up with rapidly increasing jet fuel prices. This strategy was aided by the Companys own slowdown in growth as well as significant capacity reductions by competitors in certain of the Companys markets. The Company purchased a total of 26 new Boeing 737 700 aircraft during 2008, and returned nine 737 300s from lease, resulting in the net addition of 17 aircraft for the year. This fleet growth enabled the Company to fly 3.6 percent more ASMs in 2008 versus the prior year. However, as a result of higher fares and general economic conditions, revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased only 1.6 percent, resulting in a load factor decrease of 1.4 points to 71.2 percent. As a result of the Companys management of fares, passenger revenue yield per RPM (passenger revenues divided by RPMs) increased 9.7 percent compared to 2007. Unit revenue (operating revenues divided by ASMs) also increased 7.8 percent compared to 2007 levels, primarily as a result of the higher RPM yield. Consolidated freight revenues increased $15 million, or 11.5 percent, versus 2007. This increase primarily was due to higher rates charged for cargo and freight during 2008. Other revenues increased $55 million, or 20.1 percent, compared to 2007. Approximately half of the increase was due to an increase in charter revenues versus 2007 as the Company flew charters that were not operated by competitors due to capacity reductions and or bankruptcy. The majority of the remainder of the increase was from higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase&reg; Visa card. Operating expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2008 increased $1.5 billion, or 16.6 percent, compared to a 3.6 percent increase in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2008 and 2007 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): 2008 2007 Increase(decrease) Percentchange Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.23 3.22 .01 .3 % Fuel and oil 3.60 2.70 .90 33.3 Maintenance materials and repairs .70 .62 .08 12.9 Aircraft rentals .15 .16 (.01 ) (6.3 ) Landing fees and other rentals .64 .56 .08 14.3 Depreciation and amortization .58 .56 .02 3.6 Other 1.34 1.28 .06 4.7 Total 10.24 9.10 1.14 12.5 % 31 Table of Contents The Companys 2008 CASM (cost per available seat mile) increased 12.5 percent compared to 2007. Approximately 80 percent of this increase was due to the increase in fuel expense, net of gains from the Companys fuel hedging program. The majority of the remainder of the increase was due to higher airport costs and maintenance expense. As a result of higher fuel prices throughout much of 2008, the Company continued its diligent focus on improving fuel efficiency and controlling non fuel costs. The Company implemented various technology improvements, which have improved efficiency and enabled the Company to grow headcount at either the same or a slower rate than capacity. Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $127 million on an absolute dollar basis. Nearly the entire increase was from higher salaries and wages, primarily as a result of higher average wage rates. An increase in health and workers compensation benefits primarily caused by inflationary increases in the cost of medical care was mostly offset by a $46 million decrease in profitsharing, attributable to lower income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense excludes the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel hedging and the related accounting requirements. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM was basically flat compared to 2007. Salaries and wages per ASM increased primarily due to higher wage rates, but were almost completely offset by a decline in profitsharing expense per ASM, as capacity grew 3.6 percent, but profitsharing expense declined 34.7 percent versus 2007. Fuel and oil expense increased $1.0 billion, or 38.0 percent, and on a per ASM basis increased 33.3 percent versus 2007. Both the dollar and the per ASM increase were driven primarily by a 35.6 percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel, including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging, and including related taxes. As a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and related accounting requirements, the Company recognized net gains totaling $1.1 billion in 2008 relating to fuel derivative instruments versus $686 million of net gains recognized in 2007. Cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives were $1.3 billion in 2008 versus $727 million for 2007. The primary reason that gains recognized in Fuel and oil expense during 2008 were less than the cash settlement of fuel derivatives was due to the fact that a portion of the gains associated with these settlements had already been recognized in earnings in prior periods, as they were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for special hedge accounting. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2008 increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the Company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft, its aircraft engines, and its flight plans and procedures. These steps resulted in a 2.1 percent reduction in fuel gallons consumed per ASM flown for 2008 versus 2007. Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM increased 12.9 percent compared to 2007, while increasing $105 million on a dollar basis. On both a dollar basis and a per ASM basis, engine expense accounted for almost 60 percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for approximately 40 percent of the increase. The majority of the increase in engine costs related to the Companys 737 700 aircraft. For all of 2007 and the first half of 2008, these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis. During the first half of 2008, there were significantly more repair events for these engines than in the first half of 2007. This was due to the fact that the 737 700 is the newest aircraft type in the Companys fleet, and, as this fleet has matured, the number of engines on these aircraft undergoing their first major overhaul has increased. In June 2008, the Company transitioned to a new engine repair agreement for these aircraft and expense is now based on flight hours associated with 737 700 engines. The expense for 737 700 engines recognized in the second half of 2008 associated with the new agreement also exceeded the expense recognized in the second half of 2007, when repairs were still being accounted for on a time and materials basis. The increase in airframe expense primarily was due to more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in the prior year. These events, which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown, were higher in number as well as cost per event. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 6.3 percent and, on a dollar basis, decreased slightly. Both decreases primarily were due to the fact that the Company returned nine operating lease aircraft to lessors during 32 Table of Contents 2008 while the Companys overall ASM capacity increased 3.6 percent through purchases of new aircraft from Boeing. The Company executed a sale and leaseback of five of its 737 700 aircraft during December 2008, and the leases qualified as operating leases. Landing fees and other rentals increased $102 million on a dollar basis and increased 14.3 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2007. The majority of both the dollar increase and per ASM increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of both space increases by the Company to accommodate new flight activity and higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space. A portion of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity, as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $44 million on a dollar basis compared to 2007, and was up 3.6 percent on a per ASM basis. The dollar increase primarily was due to the 26 new 737 700 aircraft purchased by the Company during 2008. On a per ASM basis, the increase was due to a higher proportion of the Companys 2008 growth being accomplished through owned aircraft. Prior to the sale and leaseback of five aircraft executed during December 2008, the Company had purchased the 26 new aircraft received during 2008 and had returned nine previously leased aircraft back to lessors, thereby increasing the percentage of the fleet owned. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys future aircraft deliveries and Note 8 for information on the sale and leaseback transactions. Other operating expenses increased $105 million and were up 4.7 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2007. The majority of the increases on both a dollar basis and a per ASM basis were due to an increase in revenue related costs (such as credit card processing fees) associated with the 11.5 percent increase in passenger revenues. Other Other expenses (income) included interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $11 million, or 9.2 percent, primarily due to the Companys issuance of $500 million Pass Through Certificates in October 2007, the Companys borrowing under its $600 million term loan in May 2008, and its borrowing of $400 million of the available $600 million under its revolving credit facility in October 2008. These issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the Companys floating rate debt. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined 50.0 percent, or $25 million, compared to 2007, due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $18 million, or 40.9 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances. 33 Table of Contents Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the Companys hedging activities. During the first half of 2008, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges, as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for special hedge accounting, as commodity prices rose during that period. During the second half of 2008, when commodity prices fell, the Company recorded significant losses from hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives not qualifying for special hedge accounting, thereby more than offsetting the gains previously recorded during the first half of the year. During 2007, the Company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for special hedge accounting. The gains resulted from the increase in the fair value of the Companys portfolio of fuel derivative instruments as commodity prices rose. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: (In millions) 2008 2007 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (6 ) $ (219 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net 106 (51 ) Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (80 ) (90 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 69 58 Other 3 10 $ 92 $ (292 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 35.9 percent in 2008 from 39.0 percent in 2007. The lower 2008 rate included a $12 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net reduction related to the first quarter 2008 reversal of a 2007 revision in Illinois income tax laws. The 2007 rate included an $11 million addition to taxes from the enactment of the Illinois tax law. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $985 million in 2009 compared to $1.5 billion used in operations in 2008. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. Operating cash flows over the past three years have also been significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, increases and or decreases to these cash deposits are reflected in operating cash flows in the caption Cash collateral received from (provided to) fuel derivative counterparties. As of December 31, 2009, the amount of cash provided to fuel hedge counterparties was $330 million, of which $92 million has been netted against Accrued liabilities and $238 million of which is netted against Other deferred liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Since the amount of cash collateral deposits provided by the Company at December 31, 2008 was $240 million, the net change in cash deposits for 2009 was a net operating outflow of $90 million. At December 31, 2007, the Company had held $2.0 billion in cash collateral from counterparties, which then resulted in a net outflow of $2.2 billion during 2008. The fluctuation in these deposits during 2008 was due to the significant decline in fair value of the Companys fuel derivative portfolio 34 Table of Contents from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2008 (in conjunction with falling energy prices). Cash flows associated with purchasing derivatives, which are also classified as operating cash flows, were a net outflow of $86 million in 2009, a net outflow of $418 million for 2008, and were immaterial for 2007. Cash flows from operating activities for 2009 were also driven by the $99 million in net income, plus noncash depreciation and amortization expense of $616 million. For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Operating cash generated is used primarily to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2009 totaled $1.6 billion, versus $978 million used in 2008. Investing activities in both years included payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 13 new 737 700 aircraft in 2009 versus the purchase of 26 737 700s in 2008. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2009 and 2008 also reflect $986 million and $55 million, respectively, related to changes in the balance of the Companys short term investments. The Company increased its short term investments in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher overall cash balances and in order to seek higher returns on its cash holdings. Net cash provided by financing activities was $330 million in 2009. During 2009, the Company raised $381 million from the sale and leaseback of 11 737 700 aircraft, and borrowed $332 million and $124 million under secured term loan arrangements. Also during 2009, the Company repaid the $400 million it had borrowed during 2008 under its revolving credit agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2008. During 2008, the Company borrowed $600 million under a term loan agreement, borrowed $400 million under its revolving credit facility, sold $400 million of Secured Notes, and raised approximately $173 million from a sale and leaseback transaction involving five of the Companys 737 700 aircraft. During 2008, the Company also received $117 million in proceeds from Employees exercise of stock options and $91 million from a credit line borrowing. These inflows were partially offset by the Companys repurchase of $54 million of its Common Stock, representing a total of 4.4 million shares. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The Company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The Company received 13 Boeing 737 700 aircraft in 2009, all of which were new aircraft from Boeing. The Company also removed 13 of its older leased and owned 737 300 aircraft from service during 2009 and executed sale and leaseback transactions for 11 of its owned 737 700 aircraft. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had firm orders for a total of 91 737 700 aircraft for the years 2010 through 2016. The Company also had options for 59 737 700 aircraft from 2011 through 2017, with an additional 54 purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft through 2018 (as further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company has the option to substitute 737 600s or 800s for the 700s. This option is applicable to aircraft ordered from Boeing and must be exercised 18 months prior to the contractual delivery date. The leasing of aircraft (including the sale and leaseback of aircraft) effectively provides flexibility to the Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating leased aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. As of December 31, 2009, the Company operated 97 leased aircraft, of which 88 are operating leases. As prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft is included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the letters of credit are off balance sheet, the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $285 million at December 31, 2009. The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009: Obligations by period (in millions) Contractual obligations 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Beyond2014 Total Long term debt (1) $ 176 $ 996 $ 573 $ 1,714 $ 3,459 Interest commitments fixed (2) 93 186 186 531 996 Interest commitments floating (3) 85 139 117 170 511 Capital lease commitments (4) 15 12 27 Operating lease commitments 414 712 476 1,032 2,634 Aircraft purchase commitments (5) 344 1,021 1,143 692 3,200 Other purchase commitments 81 110 15 206 Total contractual obligations $ 1,208 $ 3,176 $ 2,510 $ 4,139 $ 11,033 (1) Includes principal only (2) Related to fixed rate debt only (3) Interest obligations associated with floating rate debt (either at issuance or through swaps) is estimated utilizing forward interest rate curves as of December 31, 2009, and can be subject to significant fluctuation. (4) Includes amounts classified as interest (5) Firm orders from Boeing In addition to the above contractual fixed obligations, the Company also had estimated obligations at December 31, 2009, related to its fuel derivative positions for the years 2010 through 2013 (based on the contractual settlement date of those derivative instruments, but excluding the impact of the $330 million in cash collateral deposits that have been provided to counterparties, which will effectively reduce the net cash flows paid as the derivative instruments settle). Although the fair value of these positions can fluctuate significantly based on forward market prices for crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, the following table displays these estimated obligations as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 Total Fuel derivative obligations (gross) $ 124 $ 114 $ 109 $ 130 $ 477 Net of cash collateral deposits (92 ) (48 ) (107 ) (83 ) (330 ) Net fuel derivative obligations $ 32 $ 66 $ 2 $ 47 $ 147 Available to the Company at December 31, 2009, was cash on hand and short term investments totaling $2.6 billion, anticipated future internally generated funds from operations, and its $600 million bank revolving line of credit. In addition, the Company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as needed. Notwithstanding current economic conditions and the current liquidity environment, the Company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability, which should enable it to meet its 2010 capital and operating requirements. As of December 31, 2009, the book value of the Companys unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately $5.4 billion. In 2009, Standard & Poors and Fitch both downgraded the Companys credit rating from BBB+ to BBB based on lower demand, especially among business travelers, and continued volatility in fuel 36 Table of Contents prices. While the Companys credit rating remains investment grade, as defined, the lower rating will likely result in a slight increase in its borrowing costs on a prospective basis. Moodys also downgraded the Companys rating from Baa1 to Baa3 and also lowered the ratings of the Companys PTCs and EETCs. The downgrade of the Companys senior unsecured debt rating was based on Moodys expectation of continuing weak fundamentals of the domestic airline sector. The downgrade of the Companys ratings on its PTCs and EETCs reflects the reduction in the Companys underlying credit quality, and with respect to the PTCs the elevated loan to value ratios resulting from the older vintage 737 300 aircraft that are pledged as collateral for these transactions. During 2008, the City of Dallas approved the Love Field Modernization Program (LFMP), a project to reconstruct Dallas Love Field (Airport) with modern, convenient air travel facilities. Pursuant to a Program Development Agreement (PDA) with the City of Dallas, the Company is managing this project, and major construction is expected to commence during the first half of 2010, with completion scheduled for the second half of 2014. Although subject to change, at the current time the project is expected to include the renovation of the Airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new 20 gate facility, including infrastructure, systems and equipment, aircraft parking apron, fueling system, roadways and terminal curbside, baggage handling systems, passenger loading bridges and support systems, and other supporting infrastructure. Although several aspects of the project have not yet been agreed upon or finalized, the PDA contemplates that, at the Companys request, the Love Field Airport Modernization Corporation (or LFAMC, a local government corporation under Texas law formed by the City of Dallas) would issue tax exempt facility revenue bonds (LFMP Bonds), the proceeds of which would be used: (1) to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the LFMP; and (2) to reimburse the Company for up to $75 million in early LFMP expenditures made from April 25, 2008, through the date of issuance of the LFMP Bonds (such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a June 25, 2008 Inducement Resolution approved by the Dallas City Council). The PDA provides for flexibility regarding the funding of the LFMP, and the parties to the PDA are not locked in to the aforementioned preliminary funding plan. Repayment of the LFMP bonds would be through the Facilities Payments described below. Reimbursement of the Company for its payment of Facilities Payments would be made through recurring ground rents, fees, and other revenues collected at the Airport. It is also anticipated that the Company would guarantee principal, premium (if any), and interest on the bonds. Prior to any issuance of the LFMP Bonds by the LFAMC, the PDA further contemplates that the Company would enter into two separate funding agreements: (1) a Facilities Agreement pursuant to which the Company would be obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the LFMP Bonds (Facilities Payments) that are issued, less other sources of funds the City of Dallas may apply to the repayment of the LFMP Bonds (including but not limited to Passenger Facility Charges collected from passengers originating from the Airport); and (2) a Revenue Credit Agreement pursuant to which the City of Dallas would reimburse the Company for the Facilities Payments made by the Company. A majority of the monies transferred from the City of Dallas to the Company under the Revenue Credit Agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the Use and Lease Agreement that has been executed between the City of Dallas and the Company (a 20 year agreement providing for, among other things, the Companys lease of space at the airport from the City of Dallas). The remainder of such monies is expected to originate from (1) use and lease agreements with other airlines, (2) various concession agreements, and (3) other airport miscellaneous revenues. The Companys liquidity could be impacted by the LFMP to the extent there is not a successful bond issuance, or there is a timing difference between the Companys payment of the Facilities Payments pursuant to the Facilities Agreement and the transfer of monies back to the Company pursuant to the Revenue Credit Agreement; however, the Company does not currently anticipate the occurrence of these items. The LFMP is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys capital resources or financial position. In 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized two separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of $800 million of the Companys Common Stock $300 million authorized in March 2007, and $500 37 Table of Contents million authorized in May 2007. Repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. These programs, the last of which was completed during third quarter 2007, resulted in the repurchase of a total of approximately 53 million shares. During January 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys Common Stock. Repurchases have been and will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions. The Company repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total of $54 million as part of this program through February 15, 2008; however, the Company has not repurchased any additional shares from that date through the date of this filing. The Company does not believe it is prudent to repurchase shares at the current time considering the unstable financial markets and volatile fuel prices. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The Companys Air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2009, was $1.04 billion, compared to $963 million as of December 31, 2008. Estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded, exchanged, or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of forfeited tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable) that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges, net of forfeitures, for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed. These estimates are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the Companys estimates with respect to forfeited tickets. Holding other factors constant, a ten percent change in the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets during 2009 would have resulted in a $26 million, or .3 percent, change in Passenger revenues recognized for that period. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture 38 Table of Contents experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, promotional fare activity, and the impact of the economic environment on Customer behavior. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. The Companys estimation process resulted in no material adjustments being recorded during the years 2008 or 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009, as a result of the Companys efforts to stimulate demand through fare sales, passenger revenues consisted of a higher percentage of discount tickets flown and a lower percentage of fully refundable tickets flown. Consequently, the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets recorded during 2009 was in a range of approximately 30 percent to 35 percent higher than what it believes its historical averages would indicate. The Company believes these estimates are supported by actual data and are reasonable given the underlying fact patterns. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting for Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $15.9 billion (at cost) of long lived assets, including $13.7 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 449 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys active fleet at December 31, 2009, which are either owned or on capital lease, plus four older 737 300 aircraft that are not in active service. The remaining 88 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2009, are on operating lease. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: Estimated Useful Life EstimatedResidual value Aircraft and engines 23 to 25 years 10% 15% Aircraft parts Fleet life 4% Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10% Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term 0% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types, current and projected future market information, and recommendations from Boeing. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing). The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required by GAAP. When appropriate, the Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses 39 Table of Contents associated with the use of the long lived asset. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators, the Company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce operating profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Financial Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys fuel hedging program, and financial derivative instruments. All derivatives are required to be reflected at market (fair value) and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2009, the Company was a party to over 600 financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging program, for the years from 2010 through 2013. The fair value of the Companys fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009, not considering the impact of cash collateral deposits provided to counterparties, was a net liability of $477 million, compared to a liability of $992 million at December 31, 2008. The decrease in this liability primarily was due to an increase in energy prices throughout most of 2009, as well as the expiration (i.e., settlement in which the Company paid cash to counterparties) of approximately $245 million in fuel derivative instruments that related to 2009. Of the $477 million liability in fair value of fuel hedging financial derivative instruments at December 31, 2009, approximately $124 million is expected to settle or expire during 2010. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices, as has been evident in recent years. During 2008, market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of over $147 per barrel and hit a low price of under $35 per barrel both within a period of approximately five months. During 2009, these same prices ranged from a low of $33 per barrel to a high of $82 per barrel. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, and general economic conditions, among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, call spreads, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the Companys ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the Company hedges. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle, and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. In recent years, because of increased volatility in energy markets, the Companys estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated have materially differed from 40 Table of Contents actual results, resulting in increased volatility in the Companys periodic financial results. For example, historical data had been utilized in qualifying unleaded gasoline for hedge accounting under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would result in effective hedges, as defined. This historical data is updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity the Company uses in its hedging program. Based on these updates, in certain prior periods, the Company has in fact lost hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments. At such times, the Company has marked all such derivatives to market value in each quarterly period, with all changes in value reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Although commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases, there have been instances in which the Company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities. In these instances, the Company has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes reflected in the income statement each reporting period. Although the Companys prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. If recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an extended period of time or worsens in the near future, the Company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil and heating oil derivatives, which would create further volatility in the Companys financial results. Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result. This could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative instrument may not expire/settle until a future period. Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to Other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities, especially given the recent volatility in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period, including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has resulted, in increased volatility in the Companys financial statements. The significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products, and the volatility of the different types of products the Company uses for protection. The number of instances in which the Company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, has increased in recent years, primarily due to these reasons. Depending on the level at which the Company is hedged at any point in time, as the fair value of the Companys hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period, there could be continued variability recorded in the income statement, and furthermore, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material. This is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large dollar volumes. The Company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the Companys fuel hedges. The current methodology used by the Company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices, depending on specific geographic locations in which the Company hedges. 41 Table of Contents The Company then adjusts for certain items, such as transportation costs, that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors, in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge. This methodology for estimating future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) has been consistently applied during 2009, 2008, and 2007, in accordance with the Companys interpretation of applicable GAAP. The Company also has not changed its method for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments, and forward jet fuel prices, would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Share Based Compensation The Company has previously awarded share based compensation pursuant to plans covering the majority of its Employee groups, including plans adopted via collective bargaining, a plan covering the Companys Board of Directors, and plans related to employment contracts with the Chairman Emeritus of the Company. During 2009, the Company recorded share based compensation expense of $13 million, compared to $18 million in expense for 2008 and $37 million for 2007. The Company recognizes the cost of Employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, certain assumptions used in the Black Scholes model, such as expected term, can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Companys stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term. In estimating expected stock price volatility at the time of a particular stock option grant, the Company relies on observations of historical volatility trends, implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties, and implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock. For 2009, 2008, and 2007 option grants, the Company has consistently utilized a weighted average approach that calculates expected volatility using two thirds implied volatility and one third historical volatility. In determining the expected term of the option grants, the Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics, the actual vesting schedule of the grant, and has assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the Black Scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the Companys stock. The risk free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield of the Companys common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Companys current dividend yield, and adjusted for anticipated future changes. Vesting terms for the Companys stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted. For grants made to Employees under collective bargaining plans, vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement. For grants to other Employees, options generally vest and become fully exercisable over three, five, or ten years of continued employment, depending upon the grant type. For grants in any of the Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, the Company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. None of the Companys grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions, as defined. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. 42 Table of Contents Fair value measurements The Company utilizes unobservable (Level 3) inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2009, these included auction rate security investments, valued at $174 million, a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts, which were a net asset of $140 million, and $8 million in other investments. All of the Companys auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 30 35 days for most securities, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1. However, due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter 2008, the auctions for most of these instruments failed, and, therefore, the Company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of December 31, 2009, which qualify as Level 3. The Companys analyses consider, among other items, the collateralization underlying the security investments, the expected future cash flows, including the final maturity, associated with the securities, and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to par value. In association with this estimate of fair value, the Company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of $17 million, with an offsetting entry to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Given the quality and backing of the Companys auction rate securities held, the fact that the Company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments, and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments in the auction process, it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary. These conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods. The Company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the U.S. Government. In addition, for the $99 million in instruments classified as available for sale, these auction rate securities represented less than four percent of the Companys total cash, cash equivalent, and investment balance at December 31, 2009, which it believes allows it sufficient time for the securities to return to full value. For the $75 million in instruments classified as trading securities, the Company has entered into an agreement with the counterparty that allows the Company to put the instruments back to the counterparty at full par value in June 2010. As part of this agreement, the Company has entered into a line of credit in which it has received a $75 million loan that is secured by the auction rate security instruments from that counterparty. At the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter 2008, the Company held a total of $463 million in securities. Since that time, the Company has been able to sell $272 million of these instruments at par value, in addition to the $75 million subject to the agreement to be sold at par in June 2010. The Company is also in discussions with other counterparties to determine whether mutually agreeable terms can be reached regarding the effective repurchase of its remaining securities. The Company determines the value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing a standard option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are quoted by its counterparties. In situations where the Company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties, it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared. The Company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds. Due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable (primarily volatility), the Company has categorized these option contracts as Level 3. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective, as defined, are offset within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the period in which the expected cash flow impacts earnings. Any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective, as defined, or do not qualify for special hedge accounting, are reflected in 43 Table of Contents earnings within Other (gains)/losses, net, in the period of the change. Because the Company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds, and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash, the Company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the Companys derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the Companys financial statements. In addition, the Company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements, which provide for parties (or the Company) to provide cash collateral when the fair values of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels. Since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the Companys outstanding fuel derivative contracts, this provides further validation to the Companys estimate of fair values. Frequent flyer accounting The Company utilizes estimates in its recognition of liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program. These estimates include the liability associated with frequent flyer awards that have been issued, are outstanding, and are expected to be redeemed at a future date, and amounts associated with frequent flyer credits sold to companies participating in its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. A Customer must earn a minimum of 16 frequent flyer credits in order to attain a round trip award, and these credits cannot be utilized for any other type of product or service from the Company. In addition, once earned, a frequent flyer credit remains active and in the Customers account for up to 24 months before expiration. Once a Customer earns their 16th frequent flyer credit, a round trip award is automatically issued to the Customer, which can then be utilized for any destination available on Southwest, for up to a twelve month period before it expires. This standard award is subject to seat restrictions depending on the availability on a particular flight. If a Customer accumulates two standard awards, they can be converted into a Freedom Award, which is free of seat restrictions except for a limited number of Black out dates around major holidays. The Company utilizes the incremental cost method of accounting for frequent flyer awards issued from flight credits earned in the Companys Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. As such, the Company records a liability and reduction of Passenger revenue for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel at the time an award is earned. The liability recorded by the Company represents the total number of awards expected to be redeemed by Customers. The estimated incremental cost of an award includes direct passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other operational costs, but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit. The Company does not record a liability for partially earned Customer awards, although it expects that a portion of these partially earned awards will eventually turn into full awards. At December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 10.3 million full or partial awards outstanding, of which approximately 7.9 million were partially earned awards. Considering historical and expected future spoilage of both flight credits and awards, the Company estimates that a liability associated with partially earned awards would not be material to the Companys financial position at December 31, 2009, utilizing the incremental cost method of accounting for such awards. The Company also sells frequent flyer credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program. Funds received from the sale of flight segment credits are accounted for under the residual method. Under this method, the Company has estimated that approximately 75 percent of the amount received per flight segment credit sold relates to free travel, and the remaining 25 percent associated with items such as access to the Companys frequent flyer program population for marketing/solicitation purposes, use of the Companys logo on co branded credit cards, and other trademarks, designs, images, etc. of the Company for use in marketing materials. This apportionment of value between free travel and marketing services is estimated based on several factors, including fares, the habits of Customers in redeeming awards for free travel, and the contractual rate paid by companies for the flight segment credits. The amount estimated to be associated with free travel has historically been in a range of 75 percent to 82 percent. The estimated amounts associated with travel are deferred and recognized as Passenger revenue when the travel is estimated to be flown, along with the portion that expires unused. For the portion of funds received that is deemed not to be associated with future 44 Table of Contents travel, the Company has determined that the period earned is the period in which the Company has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner, which is on a monthly or quarterly basis, upon sale, as the related marketing services are performed or provided. The vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted, either monthly or quarterly, to various lists of the Companys frequent flyer members. The estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in Other revenue in the period earned. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet, and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program. In addition, the sale leaseback transactions entered into by the Company in December 2008 and in 2009 for a total of 16 aircraft, have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. The Company has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company also operates 97 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, except for the 16 aircraft that were sold and leased back in 2008 and 2009, the remainder of the Companys leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Hedging The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. The Company expects to consume approximately 1.4 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2010. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $14 million per year, excluding any impact of the Companys derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2008, the Company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that effectively represented a hedge of approximately ten percent of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from 2010 through 2013. Prior to fourth quarter 2008, the Company had held fuel derivative instruments for a significant portion of its anticipated fuel purchases for these years; however, due to a precipitous decline in fuel prices, the Company significantly reduced its hedge in order to minimize fuel hedging losses related to further oil price declines and to minimize the potential for the Company to provide additional cash collateral deposits to counterparties. The Company accomplished this reduced hedge by entering into additional derivative contracts through selling primarily fixed price swap derivatives. The Company believes this strategy enabled it to participate in further price declines via the sold derivatives, which materially offset further declines in value of the Companys previously purchased derivatives. Subsequently, in 2009, the Company again added to its hedging position related to future years expected fuel purchases. The total net fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2009, was a net liability of $147 million. This balance consists of a net liability of the market value of fuel derivative instruments totaling $477 million, net of $330 million in cash collateral that has been provided by the Company to its counterparties. The current portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $32 million, net of cash collateral 45 Table of Contents provided, is classified as a component of Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The long term portion of these financial derivative instruments, or $115 million, net of cash collateral provided, is included in Other deferred liabilities. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2009 (for all years from 2010 through 2013), prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to approximately $217 million. Fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. In addition, this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties, which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount, depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2009, levels, except underlying futures prices. The Companys credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the Company at the reporting date. At such times, these outstanding instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. However, if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the Company and were unable to meet their obligations, any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination, which could result in substantial losses for the Company. At December 31, 2009, the Company had agreements with all of its counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterpartys credit rating. The Company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the Company, or is posted by the Company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the Company. The following table provides the fair values of fuel derivatives, amounts posted as collateral, and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of December 31, 2009, at which such postings are triggered: Counterparty (CP) (in millions) A B C D E Total Fair value of fuel derivatives $ (199 ) $ (300 ) $ (27 ) $ 18 $ 30 $ (478 ) Cash collateral held by CP 205 125 330 Aircraft collateral pledged to CP 183 183 If credit rating is investment grade, fair value of fuel derivative level at which: Cash is provided to CP 0 to (300 ) 0 to (125 ) &gt;(75 ) &gt;(75 ) N/A or &gt;(700 ) or &gt;(582 ) Cash is received from CP &gt;40 &gt;150 &gt;200 *** &gt;125 N/A Aircraft is pledged to CP (300) to (700 ) (125) to (582 ) N/A N/A N/A If credit rating is non investment grade, fair value of fuel derivative level at which: Cash is provided to CP 0 to (300 ) 0 to (125 ) zero * zero * zero ** or &gt;(700 ) or &gt;(582 ) Cash is received from CP zero * zero * zero * zero * zero ** Aircraft is pledged to CP (300) to (700 ) (125) to (582 ) N/A N/A N/A * Cash collateral is provided at 100 percent of fair value of fuel derivative contracts. ** If either party is rated below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies, a cash collateral agreement would be negotiated with the CP. *** Thresholds may vary based on changes in credit ratings within investment grade. 46 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, of the $330 million in cash collateral deposits with the above counterparties under these bilateral collateral provisions, $238 million has been netted against noncurrent fuel derivative instruments within Other deferred liabilities and $92 million has been netted against current fuel derivative instruments within Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the terms of the Companys current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties, in the Companys judgment, it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements. As an example, even if market prices for the commodities used in the Companys fuel hedging activities were to decrease by 50 percent from market prices as of December 31, 2009, given the Companys current fuel derivative portfolio, its aircraft collateral facilities, and its investment grade credit rating, it would have to provide an additional $355 million in cash collateral to its current counterparties. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also has a cash collateral agreement with one of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements. Under this agreement, if the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding is a liability, the Company becomes obligated to post collateral for the value of the liability in excess of $50 million. If the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding is an asset, the counterparty becomes obligated to post collateral to the Company for the value of the asset in excess of $250 million. If either partys credit rating were lowered to below investment grade, 100 percent cash collateral is required for both parties. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of interest rate swap agreements outstanding with this counterparty was a net liability of $7 million, thus no collateral amounts had been posted. With other counterparties to which the Company has interest rate swap agreements, no cash collateral is required as long as credit ratings remain at investment grade. If either partys credit rating were lowered to below investment grade, the threshold amount at which cash collateral is required for both parties would become zero, or in one case, the parties would then negotiate an agreement. With each of these other counterparties, the net fair value of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2009, was either an asset to the Company or was immaterial. Due to the significance of the Companys fuel hedging program and the emphasis that it places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk, the Company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels. For example, the Company has put in place controls designed to: (i) create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy; (ii) provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management; (iii) provide for proper segregation of duties; (iv) maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments; and (v) have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities. The Company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program. Financial market risk The vast majority of the Companys assets are aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions. While the Company uses financial leverage, it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a BBB rating with Fitch and Standard & Poors, and a Baa3 credit rating with Moodys as of December 31, 2009. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings were originally issued as floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. This includes the Companys $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, the $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, the $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due 2027, the $400 million 10.5% secured notes due 2011, and the $300 million 5.75% senior unsecured Notes due 2016. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. 47 Table of Contents Excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Company had no fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2009. The following table displays the characteristics of the Companys secured fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2009: Principalamount(in millions) Effectivefixed rate Finalmaturity Underlying collateral Term Loan Agreement $ 124 6.840 % 7/1/2019 5 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 332 6.640 % 5/6/2019 14 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 600 5.223 % 5/9/2020 21 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $2.0 billion, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 5.2 years at floating rates averaging 5.4 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. In total, the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 13.3 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2009. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.1 billion, and short term investments, which totaled $1.5 billion, at December 31, 2009. See Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money market instruments, investment grade commercial paper, auction rate securities, and other highly rated financial instruments, depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements. However, as a result of turmoil in credit markets, the Company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2009, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash (excluding cash collateral deposits held, if applicable), floating rate aircraft leases, and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2009, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the Companys net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than $7 million. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance (excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties, if applicable), short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility, and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements, the pricing related to any funds drawn under its revolving credit facility, and some of its hedging counterparty agreements. Certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings. The Companys revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations, as defined. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility, there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility, or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written. Two of the Companys hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings 48 Table of Contents triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the Companys credit rating falls below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies, and if the Company were in a net liability position with the counterparties. As of December 31, 2009, there was no cash posted with these counterparties. The Company was in a net fuel hedge liability position with one of these counterparties at December 31, 2009. Assuming its credit rating were below investment grade as of that date, the Company would have been required to post approximately $27 million in cash collateral deposits with that counterparty. The Company currently has processing agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its Customers utilizing American Express, Discover and MasterCard/VISA. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the Company soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor would have liability if the Company does not ultimately provide the air travel. Under these processing agreements, and based on specified conditions, increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty. A majority of the Companys sales transactions are processed by Chase Paymentech. Should chargebacks processed by Chase Paymentech reach a certain level, proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur. Additionally, cash reserves are required to be established if the Companys credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade. Cash reserve requirements are based on the Companys public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the Companys Air traffic liability. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements. However, the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The Company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future. 49 Table of Contents
