These GAAP financial statements include unrealized non cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging. The Company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non GAAP financial information, including results that it refers to as economic, which the Companys management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Companys economic financial results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the Companys actual net cash outlays for Fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non GAAP (including economic) purposes. These economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Companys fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Companys management, as well as investors, to consistently assess the Companys operating performance on a year over year or quarter over quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Special items also include a 2010 charge of $7 million and a 2009 charge of $66 million (each before the impact of profitsharing or taxes) related to expenses associated with the Companys planned acquisition of AirTran and to Freedom 09, the Companys early out program, respectively. Management does not believe these expenses are a meaningful indicator of the Companys results for those particular periods or in comparison to its performance in the corresponding prior or subsequent period. As a result of the anticipated acquisition of AirTran, which is expected to close during second quarter 2011, the Company expects to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non GAAP results. See Note 2 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the planned acquisition of AirTran and Freedom 09, respectively. Further information on (i) the Companys fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and or mark to market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Year In Review The year 2010 proved to be one of significant progress for the Company in many respects. For the 38th consecutive year, the Company was profitable, earning $459 million ($.61 per share, diluted) in 2010, compared to the Companys 2009 net profit of $99 million ($.13 per share, diluted). On a non GAAP basis, the Companys 2010 net income was $550 million, or $.74 per share, diluted, which was significantly better than the Companys 2009 net income of $143 million, or $.19 per share, diluted, on a non GAAP basis. See the previous note regarding the use of non GAAP financial measures. This considerable improvement in net income was achieved through better revenue management techniques and strategies, improving economic conditions which led to higher demand for air travel, capacity restraint and reallocation by both the Company and the entire airline industry, fare increases, and targeted marketing campaigns designed to enhance the Companys already strong 38 Table of Contents Brand and Customer Experience. Even though the Companys jet fuel cost per gallon was 21.3 percent higher than 2009 on an economic basis, a 16.9 percent increase in operating revenues enabled it to overcome these higher prices and achieve a solid profit. Revenue management has been a focus area for the Company for several years, and those efforts paid significant dividends during 2010. The Company continued to optimize its flight schedule through the elimination of a number of unprofitable routes and re deployment of aircraft in either new markets or by adding additional frequencies in existing markets where demand is higher. Even with a very slight year over year capacity increase of less than one percent in 2010, the Company was able to add Panama City, Florida to its route map, as well as continue to grow such markets as Denver and Boston. This continued flight optimization, along with new expected aircraft deliveries, will also provide the Company the ability to commence service to three additional markets in the first quarter of 2011 Greenville Spartanburg, South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and the New York New Jersey area through the acquisition of 18 pairs of takeoff and landing slots at Newarks Liberty International Airport. Another milestone for the Company during 2010 was the launch of a marketing partnership with Volaris, which is Mexicos second largest airline. As a result of this marketing partnership, the Companys Customers can now book international flights to five Mexican destinations (Cancun, Guadalajara, Morelia, Toluca/Mexico City, and Zacatecas) from 20 Southwest served cities through the Companys new international connect product. The Company also completed all of the necessary testing and certifications for adding WiFi connectivity to its 737 700 aircraft fleet and began installation during the second half of 2010. As of January 31, 2011, WiFi connectivity is available on more than 60 aircraft and the Company expects these installations to continue on its remaining 737 700 fleet. The Company believes all of these accomplishments, along with initiatives introduced in the prior year, including new service offerings such as EarlyBird Check in and Pets Are Welcome on Southwest (PAWS) products, are examples of opportunities for continued future revenue growth. Planning for the future has been an area of intense focus for the Company in 2010, as well. During 2010, the Company announced it would be converting a portion of its future aircraft orders with Boeing to 737 800 aircraft. All 20 of the Companys existing orders for aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2012 have been converted to 737 800s. These aircraft offer approximately 25 to 30 percent more Customer seating capacity than the Companys existing fleet of 737 700s and 737 300s, which will enable it to more economically add service to longer range markets or to add seats to current markets without increasing the number of flights. The Company is also evaluating substituting 737 800s in lieu of 737 700 firm orders currently scheduled for 2013 through 2016. The Company has also made the decision to embark on a project that will result in the ultimate replacement of its reservations system over the next several years, and will launch its All New Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program on March 1, 2011. The Company believes a new reservations system and the new frequent flyer program will create a platform for enhanced revenue growth over the long term. Under the new frequent flyer program, members will earn points for every dollar spent instead of credits for flight segments flown. The amount of points earned will be based on the fare and fare class purchased, with higher fare products (e.g., Business Select) earning more points than lower fare products (e.g., Wanna Get Away). Each fare class will be associated with a points earning multiplier, and points for flights will be calculated by multiplying the fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier. Likewise, the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight will be based on the fare and fare class purchased; however, unlike the current program, under the new program, (i) members will be able to redeem their points for every available seat, every day, on every flight, and with no blackout dates; and (ii) points will not expire so long as the Rapid Rewards Member has points earning activity during a 24 month time period. In addition, Rapid Rewards Credit Cardmembers will be able to redeem their points for items other than travel on Southwest Airlines, such as international flights, cruises, hotel stays, rental cars, gift cards, event tickets, and more. In addition to earning points for revenue flights, Rapid Rewards Members will have the ability to purchase points. The new frequent flyer program also features enhanced A List and Companion Pass programs for the most active members, and adds a new level of status, A List Preferred. Both A List and A List Preferred Members will enjoy benefits such as priority checkin and security lane and ticket counter access, dedicated phone lines, 39 Table of Contents standby priority, and an earnings bonus on eligible revenue flights (25% for A List and 100% for A List Preferred). In addition, A List Preferred Members will enjoy free Inflight WiFi on equipped flights. The new program has been designed to drive more revenue by (i) bringing in new Customers both frequent flyers as well as new members for the Companys co branded Visa card; (ii) increasing business from existing Customers; and (iii) strengthening the Companys Rapid Rewards hotel, rental car, credit card, and retail partnerships. The most significant strategic decision made by the Company during 2010, however, was its entry into an agreement to acquire AirTran Holdings, Inc. (AirTran). Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both the Company and AirTran, if the merger is completed, each outstanding share of AirTran common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.321 shares of Southwest Airlines Co. common stock and $3.75 in cash, without interest. The number of shares of Southwest common stock and, under some circumstances, the cash consideration to be received is subject to adjustment based on the Companys share price prior to closing. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the merger, the merger agreement, and the exchange ratio adjustment mechanism. The Company believes that, if approved, its proposed acquisition of AirTran would position it to better respond to the economic and competitive challenges of the industry because: it represents a unique opportunity to grow the Companys presence in key markets it does not yet serve and would represent a significant step toward positioning the Company for future growth; it would allow the Company to offer more low fare destinations by extending its network and diversifying into new markets, including significant opportunities to and from Atlanta, the busiest airport in the United States and the largest domestic market the Company does not currently serve; it would allow the Company to expand its presence in slot controlled markets where the Company currently has little (New York LaGuardia) or no (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) service; it would allow the Company to expand its service in other key domestic markets, including Boston and Baltimore and to add destinations to its route system; based on current operations, the addition of AirTran would increase the Companys share of current domestic market share capacity (as measured by ASMs) from approximately 15 percent to 19 percent; it would provide access to near international leisure markets in the Caribbean and Mexico, as well as smaller cities, and provide firsthand and meaningful insight into these new expansion opportunities; and based on current operations, it is expected that the combined company would serve more than 100 million customers annually from more than 100 different destinations in the United States and near international destinations. The merger is subject to both government and AirTran stockholder approval, with closing expected to occur in second quarter 2011. The Company believes the transaction has the potential to yield net annual synergies of more than $400 million by 2013. Excluding one time acquisition and integration costs estimated to be approximately $500 million, the transaction is also expected to be accretive to the Companys fully diluted earnings per share in the first year following the close of the transaction, and strongly accretive, thereafter, upon full realization of the estimated net synergies. In addition, the Company and AirTran are complementary, with little route overlap between the two carriers, and strategically, both carriers have an emphasis on outstanding Customer service, high quality low cost operations, all Boeing fleets, solid low fare brands, and strong Employee cultures. The Company believes its Bags Fly Free and No Change Fees campaigns, its new frequent flyer program, continued schedule optimization, and other revenue management efforts offer significant potential for continued 40 Table of Contents revenue momentum. However, higher fuel prices do present a threat to the Company, and there are no assurances the Company will be able to generate enough incremental revenues to offset higher fuel costs. Absent increased fuel price volatility or slowing of consumer travel demand, the Company has a solid outlook for 2011. Other than the Companys growth opportunity presented by the AirTran acquisition, the Company currently does not intend to significantly grow its overall fleet size for 2011. The Company anticipates it will receive 19 737 700 deliveries during 2011, 17 of which are new aircraft from Boeing, and is currently expecting to retire a similar number of its older 737 300s. However, even with relatively little fleet growth, the Company currently forecasts 2011 ASMs to increase approximately five to six percent compared to 2010. Results of Operations 2010 compared with 2009 The Companys consolidated net income of $459 million ($.61 per share, diluted) in 2010 represented an increase of $360 million, or 364 percent, compared to its 2009 net income of $99 million ($.13 per share, diluted). The results in each year were significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the Companys hedging activities. As a result of the fuel hedges the Company had in place during 2010 including those that settled during 2010 and those that will settle in future years the Company recognized a net total of $426 million in losses allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2009, the Company recognized a total of $408 million in losses as a result of its fuel hedging activities, allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net. Each of these totals for 2010 and 2009 includes the net premium costs the Company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which are classified as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments. The Companys results for 2009 also included a one time charge of $66 million (before the impact of profitsharing or taxes) related to Freedom 09, a voluntary early retirement program that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this program. The Companys 2010 operating income was $988 million, which was significantly better than the Companys 2009 operating income of $262 million, as the 16.9 percent increase in operating revenues outpaced the 10.2 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 16.9 percent, primarily due to a $1.6 billion, or 16.1 percent, increase in Passenger revenues. The majority of the increase in Passenger revenues was attributable to the 10.8 percent increase in Passenger yield (Passenger revenues per RPM flown), primarily due to higher average fares. The Companys load factor also increased 3.3 points to 79.3 percent in 2010, which was a record for the Company. These strong revenue results were achieved due to better revenue management techniques and strategies, improving economic conditions which led to higher demand for air travel versus 2009, including a new and improved website at www.southwest.com, capacity restraint and reallocation by both the Company and the entire airline industry, fare increases, and targeted marketing campaigns designed to enhance the Companys already strong Brand and Customer Experience. Bookings, thus far, for first quarter 2011 are strong. For January 2011, the Company estimated passenger unit revenues increased in the eight to nine percent range as compared to January 2010. Consolidated Freight revenues increased $7 million, or 5.9 percent, versus 2009, primarily due to higher average rates charged as a result of better economic conditions versus the prior year. The Company currently expects freight revenues for first quarter 2011 to be in line with fourth quarter 2010 freight revenues. Other revenues increased $150 million, or 44.1 percent, compared to 2009. Approximately 63 percent of the increase was due to revenues from initiatives, such as the Companys EarlyBird product, for which Customers can pay $10 to automatically receive an assigned boarding position before general checkin begins, and service charges for 41 Table of Contents unaccompanied minors and for pets. The remainder of the increase primarily was due to higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as the Company sponsored Chase&reg; Visa card. The Company also expects Other revenues for first quarter 2011 to exceed first quarter 2010, due to anticipated increased revenues from these initiatives, but at a significantly lower rate than the 41.2 percent year over year increase in fourth quarter 2010. Operating expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2010 increased $1.0 billion, or 10.2 percent, compared to a slight increase in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2010 and 2009 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): 2010 2009 Increase(decrease) Percentchange Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.76 3.54 .22 6.2 % Fuel and oil 3.68 3.11 .57 18.3 Maintenance materials and repairs .76 .73 .03 4.1 Aircraft rentals .18 .19 (.01 ) (5.3 ) Landing fees and other rentals .82 .73 .09 12.3 Depreciation and amortization .64 .63 .01 1.6 Other 1.45 1.36 .09 6.6 Total 11.29 10.29 1.00 9.7 % The Companys 2010 CASM (cost per available seat mile) increased 9.7 percent compared to 2009. Over 55 percent of this year over year CASM increase was due to an 18.4 percent increase in the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon. The Companys 2009 operating expenses also included the impact of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company, which resulted in a $66 million charge. Excluding the impact of this prior year charge, 2010 integration costs associated with the Companys anticipated acquisition of AirTran, and Fuel and oil expense for each year, 2010 CASM increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher wage rates, higher profitsharing expense, and higher airport costs. Based on current cost trends and an estimated eight to nine percent increase in first quarter year over year capacity, the Company anticipates first quarter 2011 unit costs to increase at a lower year over year rate than fourth quarter 2010s 5.8 percent, excluding fuel and special items. Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $236 million on an absolute dollar basis, including the impact of the $66 million charge recorded during third quarter 2009 as a result of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. Excluding the impact of the Freedom 09 charge, approximately 55 percent of the year over year increase was from higher salaries and wages, primarily as a result of higher average wage rates. The remainder of the year over year increase primarily was attributable to a $124 million increase in profitsharing, as a result of higher income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records for its fuel hedging program. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel hedging. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM was 6.2 percent higher than 2009, primarily due to pay scale increases as a result of increased seniority and contractual rate increases for the Companys unionized workforce, who make up the majority of its Employees, while the Companys ASM capacity increased only slightly compared to 2009. These increases combined with relatively flat headcount resulted in higher average rates per Employee. Based on current cost trends and anticipated capacity, the Company expects salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM in first quarter 2011 to be relatively consistent with first quarter 2010s unit cost of 3.82 cents. The Companys Pilots are subject to an agreement between the Company and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) that was to become amendable August 31, 2011. As part of its evaluation process for 42 Table of Contents the addition of the Boeing 737 800 to its fleet, the Company and SWAPA agreed on a one year contract extension to the existing agreement. Their contract now becomes amendable August 31, 2012. The Companys Flight Attendants are subject to an agreement between the Company and the Transport Workers Union Local No. 556 (TWU 556) that was to become amendable May 31, 2012. As part of its evaluation process for the addition of the Boeing 737 800 to its fleet, the Company and TWU 556 agreed on a one year contract extension to the existing agreement. Their contract now becomes amendable May 31, 2013. The Companys Stock Clerks are subject to an agreement between the Company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 19 (IBT Local 19). This agreement became amendable in August 2008. The Company is currently in discussions on a new agreement with IBT Local 19. The Companys Aircraft Appearance Technicians and its Dispatchers are subject to agreements between the Company and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) and the Company and the Transportation Workers of America, AFL CIO, Local 550 (TWU 550), which became amendable in February and November 2009, respectively. The Company is currently in discussions on new agreements with both AMFA and TWU 550. Fuel and oil expense increased $576 million, or 18.9 percent, and on a per ASM basis increased 18.3 percent versus 2009. Both the dollar and the per ASM increase were driven primarily by an 18.4 percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel, including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging, and including related taxes. As a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of the accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognized net losses totaling $324 million in 2010 in Fuel and oil expense relating to fuel derivative instruments versus net losses of $467 million recognized in Fuel and oil expense in 2009. These totals are inclusive of cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives, which were $153 million paid to counterparties in 2010 versus $245 million paid to counterparties for 2009. However, these totals exclude gains and or losses recognized from hedge ineffectiveness, which are recorded as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 18, 2011, the Company had derivative contracts in place related to first quarter and full year 2011 at the following levels: Average Crude OilPrice per barrel Percent of estimated fuel consumptioncovered by fuel derivative contracts* 1Q 2011 Full Year 2011 Up to $90 68 % 64 % $90 to $95 33 % 52 % $95 to $105 15 % 29 % Above $105 39 % 51 % * Estimated fuel consumption for 2011 and beyond excludes any potential impact of the Companys proposed acquisition of AirTran Holdings, Inc. Beyond 2011, excluding the impact of the anticipated AirTran acquisition, the Company has coverage of approximately 60 percent of its estimated fuel consumption in 2012; approximately 50 percent in 2013; and approximately 45 percent in 2014, all at varying price levels. As a result of prior hedging activities, the Company continues to have significant amounts frozen in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), and these amounts will be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in future periods when the underlying fuel derivative contracts settle. The following table displays the Companys estimated fair value of remaining fuel derivative contracts (not considering the impact of the cash collateral provided to or received from counterparties See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 43 Table of Contents Statements for further information) as well as the amount of deferred losses in AOCI at December 31, 2010, and the expected future periods in which these items are expected to settle and or be recognized in earnings (in millions): Year Fair value(liability) of fuelderivative contractsat December 31,2010 Amount of gains(losses) deferredin AOCI atDecember 31,2010 (net of tax) 2011 $ (62 ) $ (112 ) 2012 $ 15 $ (63 ) 2013 $ 12 $ (89 ) 2014 $ 177 $ 14 Total $ 142 $ (250 ) Based on forward market prices and the amounts in the above table (and excluding any other subsequent changes to the fuel hedge portfolio), the Companys jet fuel costs per gallon are expected to exceed market (i.e., unhedged) prices during some of these future periods. This is based primarily on expected future cash settlements associated with fuel derivatives, but excludes any impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market because they do not qualify for hedge accounting. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Based on its fuel hedge portfolio and market prices (as of January 18, 2011), the Company estimates its economic fuel costs, including fuel taxes, for first quarter 2011 will be approximately $2.80 per gallon. Assuming no changes to the Companys current 2011 fuel derivative portfolio, but including all previous hedge activity for fuel derivatives that have not yet settled, and considering only the expected net cash payments related to hedges that will settle in 2011, the Company is providing a sensitivity table for first quarter 2011 and full year 2011 jet fuel prices at different crude oil assumptions as of January 18, 2011, and for expected premium costs associated with settling contracts each period. Estimated difference inSouthwest economic jet fuel price pergallon, compared to unhedgedmarket prices, including taxes * Avg crude oil price per barrel First quarter 2011 Full year 2011 $70 $ .21 above market $ .21 above market $90 $ .04 above market $ .04 above market $92 $ .02 above market at market $100 $ .03 above market at market $125 $ .05 below market $ .16 below market Estimated premium costs** $31 million $141 million * Based on the current actual forward crude oil curve for 2011 as of January 18, 2011 ** Premium costs are recognized as a component of Other (gains) losses, net Maintenance materials and repairs increased 4.5 percent on a dollar basis, and increased 4.1 percent on a per ASM basis compared to 2009. On both a dollar and a per ASM basis, the increases were due to an increase in the number of scheduled airframe maintenance events versus 2009. The Company expects Maintenance materials and repairs per ASM for first quarter 2011 to be slightly higher than the .79 cents per ASM experienced in fourth quarter 2010, based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events and projected engine hours flown. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 5.3 percent and, on a dollar basis, decreased $6 million. Both decreases primarily were due to the renegotiation of several aircraft leases at lower rates. Based on current fleet plans, the Company expects rental expense per ASM for first quarter 2011 to increase slightly from the .18 cents per ASM experienced in fourth quarter 2010. 44 Table of Contents Landing fees and other rentals increased $89 million on a dollar basis and increased 12.3 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2009. The majority of both the dollar increase and per ASM increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of higher rates charged by those airports due to either higher operating costs or to cover shortfalls caused by reductions in service by airlines over the past few years. When airlines reduce their capacity, airport costs are then allocated amongst a fewer number of total flights. As a consequence of continued rate inflation at various airports, the Company currently expects Landing fees and other rentals per ASM in first quarter 2011 to be higher than the .84 cents per ASM experienced in first quarter 2010. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12 million on a dollar basis compared to 2009, and was up 1.6 percent on a per ASM basis. These increases were both primarily due to the amortization of capitalized software costs associated with various information technology upgrade and replacement projects the Company completed during 2010. For first quarter 2011, the Company expects Depreciation and amortization expense per ASM to increase slightly from fourth quarter 2010s .64 cents. Other operating expenses increased $89 million, and were up 6.6 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2009. On both a dollar and a per ASM basis, these increases primarily were due to an increase in revenue related costs (such as credit card interchange fees) associated with the 16.1 percent increase in Passenger revenues. Excluding any first quarter 2011 costs incurred in connection with planning for the integration and transition related to the Companys anticipated 2011 acquisition of AirTran, the Company currently expects other operating expenses on a per ASM basis for first quarter 2011 to be approximately 1.60 cents. Through the 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, the federal government has continued to provide renewable, supplemental, first party war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers, at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market. The government provided supplemental coverage from the Wartime Act is currently set to expire on September 30, 2011. Although another extension beyond this date is expected, if such coverage is not extended by the government, the Company could incur substantially higher insurance costs or unavailability of adequate coverage in future periods. Other Other expenses (income) include interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense decreased by $19 million, or 10.2 percent, primarily due to the Companys conversion of its $400 million of 10.5% secured notes due 2011 and its $300 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2016 to floating interest rates during fourth quarter 2009. The Company currently expects its first quarter 2011 interest expense to be consistent with first quarter 2010. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined 14.3 percent, or $3 million, compared to 2009, due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $1 million, or 7.7 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances. 45 Table of Contents Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the Companys fuel hedging activities. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: (In millions) 2010 2009 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (21 ) $ (73 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net (11 ) (97 ) Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (1 ) (38 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 134 148 Other 5 6 $ 106 $ (54 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 38.4 percent in 2010 from 39.6 percent in 2009. The lower 2010 rate primarily was due to the Companys higher 2010 earnings, which dilutes the impact of permanent tax differences, thus reducing the tax rate. The Company currently expects its 2011 effective tax rate to be 38 to 39 percent. 2009 compared with 2008 The Companys consolidated net income of $99 million ($.13 per share, diluted) in 2009 represented a decrease of $79 million, or 44.4 percent, compared to its 2008 net income of $178 million ($.24 per share, diluted). The results in each year were significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the Companys hedging activities. As a result of the fuel hedges the Company had in place during 2009 including those that settled during 2009 and those that will settle in future years the Company recognized a net total of $408 million in losses allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2008, the Company had recognized a total of $1.0 billion in net gains as a result of its fuel hedging activities, allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net. Each of these totals for 2009 and 2008 includes the net premium costs the Company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which is classified as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments. Operating revenues Consolidated operating revenues decreased $673 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to a $657 million, or 6.2 percent, decrease in Passenger revenues. The majority of the decline in Passenger revenues was attributable to a 7.4 percent decrease in Passenger revenue yields (Passenger revenues divided by revenue Passenger miles or RPMs), as the percentage of full fare bookings was down versus 2008 and the Company offered more fare sales and discounted seats in response to the decline in demand for air travel amid domestic economic conditions. However, as a result of the Companys fare discounting efforts and a number of newly implemented revenue initiatives, combined with a 5.1 percent reduction in ASMs, load factor increased 4.8 points to 76.0 percent in 2009. The higher load factor mostly offset the decline in Passenger yield, resulting in only a net 1.0 percent decline in operating revenue yield per ASM (unit revenue) versus 2008. 46 Table of Contents The revenue initiatives implemented by the Company in 2009 enabled it to partially offset the loss of full fare traffic versus 2008 and thus minimize the year over year decline in unit revenues. During 2009, the Company launched a new and improved website at www.southwest.com, introduced EarlyBird check in, which allows Customers to pay $10 to automatically get an assigned boarding position before general check in begins, introduced new fees for unaccompanied minors and for pets, and continued to optimize its schedule and tout its Bags Fly Free campaign. Consolidated freight revenues decreased $27 million, or 18.6 percent, versus 2008. This decrease primarily was due to fewer shipments as a result of the worldwide recession in 2009. This prevented the Company from being able to increase its shipping rates during 2009. During the majority of 2008, better economic conditions enabled the Company to increase its shipping rates when fuel prices were rising. Other revenues increased $11 million, or 3.3 percent, compared to 2008. The majority of the increase was due to revenues from 2009 revenue initiatives, such as fees for unaccompanied minors and for pets, revenue from the Companys EarlyBird initiative, and an increase in the fee charged for Customers checking a third bag. Operating expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2009 decreased $486 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to a 5.1 percent decrease in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2009 and 2008 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): 2009 2008 Increase(decrease) Percentchange Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.54 3.23 .31 9.6 % Fuel and oil 3.11 3.60 (.49 ) (13.6 ) Maintenance materials and repairs .73 .70 .03 4.3 Aircraft rentals .19 .15 .04 26.7 Landing fees and other rentals .73 .64 .09 14.1 Depreciation and amortization .63 .58 .05 8.6 Other 1.36 1.34 .02 1.5 Total 10.29 10.24 .05 .5 % The Companys 2009 CASM was up slightly from 2008, increasing by a net .5 percent. However, 2009 operating expense included the impact of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company, which resulted in a $66 million charge recorded during third quarter 2009. Excluding the impact of this charge, 2009 CASM was flat compared to 2008 as lower fuel costs were offset by higher airport costs and by higher wage rates paid to nearly all Employee groups. Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $128 million on an absolute dollar basis, including the $66 million charge recorded during third quarter 2009 as a result of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. Excluding the impact of the Freedom 09 charge, the majority of the year over year increase was from higher salaries and wages, primarily as a result of higher average wage rates. This was partially offset by a $53 million decrease in profitsharing, attributable to lower income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records in its fuel hedging program. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel hedging. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM was 9.6 percent higher than 2008, primarily due to the fact that the Companys unionized workforce, who make up the majority of its Employees, had pay scale increases as a result of increased seniority, while the Companys ASM capacity declined 5.1 percent compared to 2008. 47 Table of Contents Fuel and oil expense decreased $669 million, or 18.0 percent, and on a per ASM basis decreased 13.6 percent versus 2008. Both the dollar and the per ASM decrease were driven primarily by a 13.1 percent decrease in the average price per gallon for jet fuel, including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging, and including related taxes. As a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of the accounting requirements for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognized net losses totaling $467 million in 2009 in Fuel and oil expense relating to fuel derivative instruments versus $1.1 billion of net gains recognized in Fuel and oil expense in 2008. These totals are inclusive of cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives, which were $245 million paid to counterparties in 2009 versus $1.3 billion received from counterparties for 2008. Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, there were net losses recognized in Fuel and oil expense, of $222 million and $188 million, respectively, due to the fact that the Company had previously recognized gains associated with settling contracts in each period that were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting. However, these totals exclude gains and or losses recognized from hedge ineffectiveness, which are recorded as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, the Company also continued to make progress in improving the fuel efficiency of its fleet. Despite the large increase in load factor from 2008 to 2009, the Company was able to produce the same fuel gallons consumed per ASM flown for each year. Maintenance materials and repairs were flat on a dollar basis, but increased 4.3 percent on a per ASM basis compared to 2008. On a dollar basis, an increase in engine expense was mostly offset by a decrease in airframe expense. The majority of the increase in engine costs related to the Companys 737 700 aircraft, which for the second half of 2008 and all of 2009 were accounted for under an agreement with GE Engines Services, Inc. (GE Engines) that provides for engine repairs to be done on a rate per flight hour basis. For the first half of 2008, these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis, and there were very few repair events. The expense for 737 700 engines recognized in 2009 associated with the current agreement exceeded the expense recognized in 2008. Under this engine agreement, which is similar to the power by the hour agreement with GE Engines the Company has in place for its 737 300 and 737 500 fleet, payments are primarily based on a rate per flight hour basis. Since the Company has effectively transferred the risk for specified future repairs and maintenance on these engines to the service provider, expense is recorded commensurate with each hour flown on an engine. The decrease in airframe expense primarily was due to a decline in the number of scheduled airframe maintenance events versus 2008. On a per ASM basis, the increase in Maintenance materials and repairs compared to 2008 primarily was due to the increase in 737 700 engine costs combined with the Companys 5.1 percent decline in ASMs. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM increased 26.7 percent and, on a dollar basis, increased $32 million. Both increases primarily were due to the fact that the Company executed sale and leaseback transactions for a total of 16 of its 737 700 aircraft during December 2008 and the first half of 2009, combined with the impact of the Companys 5.1 percent ASM reduction for 2009 compared to 2008. All of the lease agreements executed as part of the sale and leaseback transactions were classified as operating leases. Landing fees and other rentals increased $56 million on a dollar basis and increased 14.1 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2008. The majority of both the dollar increase and per ASM increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space. The majority of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity during 2009 (which in most cases exceeded the Companys capacity reductions at those airports), as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17 million on a dollar basis compared to 2008, and was up 8.6 percent on a per ASM basis. The increase on a dollar basis primarily was due to higher owned aircraft depreciation expense, primarily due to a reduction in the estimated salvage values of owned aircraft that were recently retired or are expected to be retired during 2010 and 2011, based on current and expected future market conditions for used aircraft. This increase in expense was mostly offset by the execution of sale and leaseback 48 Table of Contents agreements for 11 previously owned 737 700s during the first half of 2009. The increase on a per ASM basis primarily was due to the fact that the Companys fleet size remained constant, while it reduced the number of ASMs flown as a result of economic conditions. Other operating expenses decreased $48 million, but were up 1.5 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2008. Approximately 29 percent of the decrease on a dollar basis was due to lower bad debt expense related to revenues from credit card sales, and another 28 percent of the decrease was due to lower personnel expenses, primarily due to the reduction in headcount, the Companys decline in capacity versus 2008, and other cost reduction efforts. On a per ASM basis, the increase in operating expenses per ASM primarily was due to an increase in advertising expense compared to 2008 combined with the reduction in ASMs. Other Other expenses (income) include interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Interest expense increased by $56 million, or 43.1 percent, primarily due to new debt issuances, including the Companys December 2008 issuance of $400 million of secured notes, its borrowing under its $332 million term loan in May 2009, and its July 2009 $124 million borrowing under a term loan agreement. These issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the Companys floating rate debt. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on long term debt transactions. Capitalized interest declined 16.0 percent, or $4 million, compared to 2008, due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $13 million, or 50.0 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the Companys fuel hedging activities. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: (In millions) 2009 2008 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net $ (73 ) $ (6 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods included in Other (gains) losses, net (97 ) 106 Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses included in Other (gains) losses, net (38 ) (80 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts included in Other (gains) losses, net 148 69 Other 6 3 $ (54 ) $ 92 See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 39.6 percent in 2009 from 35.9 percent in 2008. The lower 2008 rate included a $12 million ($.01 per share, diluted) net reduction related to the first quarter 2008 reversal of a 2007 revision in Illinois income tax laws. The 2009 rate also includes the impact of slightly higher effective state income tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion in 2010 compared to $985 million provided by operations in 2009. For the Company, operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air 49 Table of Contents transportation for Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline. Operating cash flows can also be significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, increases and or decreases to these cash deposits are reflected in operating cash flows as Cash collateral received from (provided to) fuel derivative counterparties. As of December 31, 2010, the net amount of cash provided to fuel hedge counterparties was $65 million. Since the amount of cash collateral deposits provided by the Company at December 31, 2009 was $330 million, the net change in cash deposits for 2010 was a net operating inflow of $265 million. Cash flows associated with entering into new fuel derivatives, which are also classified as operating cash flows, were net outflows of $359 million in 2010, $86 million in 2009, and $418 million in 2008. Cash flows from operating activities for 2010 were also driven by $459 million in net income, plus noncash depreciation and amortization expense of $628 million. For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Operating cash generated is used primarily to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2010 totaled $1.3 billion, versus $1.6 billion used in 2009. Investing activities in both years included payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 11 new 737 700 aircraft in 2010 versus the purchase of 13 737 700s in 2009. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2010 and 2009 also reflect $772 million and $986 million, respectively, related to changes in the balance of the Companys short term investments. The Company increased its short term investments in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher overall cash balances and in order to seek higher returns on its cash holdings. Net cash used in financing activities was $149 million in 2010. During 2010, the Company repaid $155 million in debt and capital lease obligations that came due, and also repaid $44 million from a credit line borrowing associated with auction rate security instruments that were redeemed back to its counterparty. Net cash provided by financing activities was $330 million in 2009. During 2009, the Company raised $381 million from the sale and leaseback of 11 737 700 aircraft, and borrowed $332 million and $124 million under secured term loan arrangements. Also during 2009, the Company repaid the $400 million it had borrowed during 2008 under its revolving credit agreement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt and Note 6 for more information on the Companys revolving credit arrangement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments The Company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The Company received 12 Boeing 737 700 aircraft in 2010, 11 of which were new aircraft purchased from Boeing and one of which was leased from a third party. The Company also brought back its four 737 300 aircraft that had been removed from active service and put into storage during 2009, and retired five older leased and owned 737 300 aircraft from service during 2010. As of January 19, 2011, the Company had firm orders with Boeing for a total of 88 737 700 aircraft and 20 737 800 aircraft for the years 2011 through 2016. The firm orders for the 20 737 800 aircraft are a result of the Companys decision to substitute this aircraft type for 737 700s that had been previously ordered for 2012. The Company also had purchase options for 37 737 700 aircraft from 2013 through 2017, with an additional 98 purchase rights for 737 700 aircraft through 2021 (as further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company also has the option to substitute 737 600s for the 737 700s ordered from Boeing with at least 18 months notice prior to the contractual delivery date, and can substitute 737 800s for the 737 700s with at least twelve months notice. The leasing of aircraft (including the sale and leaseback of aircraft) effectively provides flexibility to the Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and 50 Table of Contents expense associated with operating leased aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. As of December 31, 2010, the Company operated 97 leased aircraft, of which 92 are under operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft is included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the letters of credit are off balance sheet, the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $234 million at December 31, 2010. The following table aggregates the Companys material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010: Obligations by period (in millions) Contractual obligations 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Beyond2015 Total Long term debt (1) $ 505 $ 605 $ 584 $ 1,591 $ 3,285 Interest commitments fixed (2) 81 147 123 186 537 Interest commitments floating (3) 66 67 84 125 342 Operating lease commitments 386 747 524 886 2,543 Aircraft purchase commitments (4) 594 1,377 1,265 540 3,776 Other commitments 78 119 7 717 921 Total contractual obligations $ 1,710 $ 3,062 $ 2,587 $ 4,045 $ 11,404 (1) Includes principal only (2) Related to fixed rate debt only (3) Interest obligations associated with floating rate debt (either at issuance or through swaps) is estimated utilizing forward interest rate curves as of December 31, 2010, and can be subject to significant fluctuation. (4) Firm orders from Boeing As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a portion of the consideration to be paid by the Company in connection with its planned acquisition of AirTran will be in cash. The Company intends to fund up to $670 million in cash consideration to AirTran stockholders out of cash on hand upon closing of the acquisition, which is expected to occur during second quarter 2011. The Company also expects to incur approximately $500 million in integration and closing costs associated with the acquisition, a portion of which are expected to be in 2011, and which are expected to be funded with cash. The Company believes that its current liquidity position, including cash and short term investments of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, anticipated future internally generated funds from operations, and its fully available, unsecured revolving credit facility of $600 million, will enable it to fund the acquisition without adding significant further borrowings. Additionally, as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as set forth above in the contractual obligations table, the Company has long term debt maturities of $400 million in December 2011 and $385 million in March 2012. The Company will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as needed. The Company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability, which should enable it to meet its ongoing capital, operating, and other liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2010, the book value of the Companys unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately $6.6 billion. During 2008, the City of Dallas approved the Love Field Modernization Program (LFMP), a project to reconstruct Dallas Love Field (Airport) with modern, convenient air travel facilities. Pursuant to a Program Development Agreement (PDA) with the City of Dallas and the Love Field Airport Modernization Corporation 51 Table of Contents (or LFAMC, a Texas non profit local government corporation established by the City to act on the Citys behalf to facilitate the development of the LFMP), the Company is managing this project. Major construction commenced during 2010, with completion of the project scheduled for the second half of 2014. Although subject to change, at the current time the project is expected to include the renovation of the Airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new 20 gate facility, including infrastructure, systems and equipment, aircraft parking apron, fueling system, roadways and terminal curbside, baggage handling systems, passenger loading bridges and support systems, and other supporting infrastructure. During fourth quarter 2010, the LFAMC issued $310 million in tax exempt facility revenue bonds (LFMP Bonds), the proceeds of which have been or will be used: (1) to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the LFMP; and (2) to reimburse the Company for approximately $80 million in early LFMP expenditures made from April 25, 2008, through the date of issuance of the LFMP Bonds (such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a June 25, 2008 Inducement Resolution approved by the Dallas City Council and subsequent Resolutions by the LFAMC). Repayment of the LFMP Bonds will be through the Facilities Payments described below. Reimbursement of the Company for its payment of Facilities Payments are expected to be made through recurring ground rents, fees, and other revenues collected at the Airport. The Company has guaranteed principal, premium, and interest on the issued bonds. Depending on funding needs and the timing of these funds from other sources, an additional tranche of bonds will likely be issued prior to the completion of the LFMP project. It is currently expected that the total amount spent on the LFMP project will be approximately $519 million. Prior to the issuance of the LFMP Bonds by the LFAMC, the Company entered into two separate funding agreements: (1) a Facilities Agreement pursuant to which the Company is obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the LFMP Bonds (Facilities Payments), less other sources of funds the City of Dallas may apply to the repayment of the LFMP Bonds (including but not limited to passenger facility charges collected from passengers originating from the Airport); and (2) a Revenue Credit Agreement pursuant to which the City of Dallas will reimburse the Company for the Facilities Payments made by the Company. A majority of the monies transferred from the City of Dallas to the Company under the Revenue Credit Agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the Use and Lease Agreement between the City of Dallas and the Company. The Use and Lease Agreement is a 20 year agreement providing for, among other things, the Companys lease of space at the Airport from the City of Dallas. The remainder of such monies transferred from the City of Dallas to the Company under the Revenue Credit Agreement is expected to originate from (1) use and lease agreements with other airlines, (2) various concession agreements, and (3) other Airport miscellaneous revenues. The Companys liquidity could be impacted by the LFMP to the extent there is not an additional future successful bond issuance, or there is a timing difference between the Companys payment of the Facilities Payments pursuant to the Facilities Agreement and the transfer of monies back to the Company pursuant to the Revenue Credit Agreement; however, the Company does not currently anticipate the occurrence of either of these items. The LFMP is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys capital resources or financial position. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and accounting requirements related to the LFMP. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and 52 Table of Contents changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue recognition Tickets sold for Passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and Air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. The Companys Air traffic liability balance at December 31, 2010, was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009. The Company estimates the amount of tickets that will expire unused and recognizes such amounts in Passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed. Estimating the amount of tickets that will expire unused, be refunded, or exchanged involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Companys tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of unused tickets. According to the Companys Contract of Carriage, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable) that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Estimates of tickets that will expire unused are based on historical experience over many years. The Company and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel. Holding other factors constant, a 10 percent change in the Companys estimate of the amount of tickets that will expire unused would have resulted in a $26 million, or .2 percent, change in Passenger revenues recognized for 2010. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, changes to the Companys ticketing policies, the Companys refund and exchange policy, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, promotional fare activity, and the impact of the economic environment on Customer behavior. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. During 2009, as a result of the Companys efforts to stimulate demand through fare sales, Passenger revenues consisted of a higher percentage of discount tickets flown and a lower percentage of fully refundable tickets flown. Consequently, the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets recorded during 2009 was in a range of approximately 30 to 35 percent higher than what it believes its historical averages would indicate. The Company believes these estimates are supported by actual data and are reasonable given the underlying fact patterns. During 2008 and 2010, the Company believes the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets recorded were closer to what historical trends would indicate. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting for long lived assets As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $16.3 billion (at cost) of long lived assets, including $14.0 billion (at cost) in flight equipment and related assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 53 Table of Contents 456 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2010, which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 92 Boeing 737 aircraft in the Companys fleet at December 31, 2010, are operated under operating leases. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and their future expected cash flows. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups: EstimatedUseful Life EstimatedResidual value Aircraft and engines 23 to 25 years 10% 15% Aircraft parts Fleet life 4% Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10% Leasehold improvements Asset life or lease term 0% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types, current and projected future market information, and recommendations from Boeing. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing) as well as the aircraft age. The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to the Companys maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense, as required by GAAP. For example, during third quarter 2010, the Company changed the estimated residual values of its entire remaining fleet of owned 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft. Based on current and expected future market conditions related to these aircraft, the Company reduced the residual values of these aircraft from approximately 15 percent of original cost to approximately 10 percent of original cost. This determination was made due to the lack of buyers for these older aircraft, as many buyers of used aircraft prefer newer, more fuel efficient models, and the increase in the number of airlines retiring these older aircraft, which has effectively flooded the market. As this reduction in residual value is considered a change in estimate, it has been accounted for on a prospective basis, and thus the Company will record additional depreciation expense over the remainder of the useful lives for each aircraft. The Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. The Company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce operating profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Financial derivative instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these 54 Table of Contents risk management activities, and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments. All derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2010, the Company was a party to over 600 financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging program, for the years 2011 through 2014. The fair value of the Companys fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010, not considering the impact of cash collateral deposits provided to counterparties, was a net asset of $142 million, compared to a net liability of $477 million at December 31, 2009. The change in fair value primarily was due to an increase in energy prices throughout most of 2010, the expiration (i.e., settlement in which the Company paid cash to counterparties) of approximately $153 million in fuel derivative instruments that related to 2010, and the purchase of new derivative positions that will settle in future periods. Although the Companys fuel derivative portfolio was in a net asset position at December 31, 2010, the positions that are expected to settle or expire during 2011 currently consist of a net liability of approximately $62 million. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices, as has been evident in recent years. For example, during 2008, market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of over $147 per barrel and hit a low price of under $35 per barrel both within a period of approximately five months. During 2010, market spot prices ranged from a low of $68 per barrel to a high of $91 per barrel. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, value of the U.S. dollar, and general economic conditions, among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, call spreads, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the Companys ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the Company hedges. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. In some historical periods, because of increased volatility in energy markets, the Company has in fact lost hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments. At such times, the Company has marked all such derivatives to fair value in each quarterly period, with all changes in value reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. However, the Company did not lose hedge accounting for any entire commodities during 2010, 2009, or 2008. Although commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have historically continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases, there have been instances in which the Company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities. In these instances, the Company has also marked such derivatives to fair value with changes reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income each reporting period. Although the Companys prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that the commodities used in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. Increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time, especially if such 55 Table of Contents volatility were to worsen, could cause the Company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program, which would create further volatility in the Companys financial results. Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their fair values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result. This could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative instrument may not expire/settle until a future period. Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to Other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period of the change. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities, especially given the recent volatility in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period, including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has historically resulted, in increased volatility in the Companys financial statements. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during historical periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products, and the volatility of the different types of products the Company uses for mitigation of fuel price volatility. The discontinuation of hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, can also be a result of these reasons. Depending on the level at which the Company is hedged at any point in time, as the fair value of the Companys hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period, there could be continued variability recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and furthermore, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material. This is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large dollar volumes. The Company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting expected future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the Companys fuel hedges. The current methodology used by the Company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices, depending on specific geographic locations in which the Company hedges. The Company then adjusts for certain items, such as transportation costs, that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors, in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge. This methodology for estimating expected future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) has been consistently applied during 2010, 2009, and 2008, and has not changed for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Fair value measurements The Company utilizes unobservable (Level 3) inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2010, these included auction rate security investments, valued at $93 million, a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts, which were a net asset of $685 million, and $5 million in other investments. 56 Table of Contents All of the Companys auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 30 35 days for most securities, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1. However, due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter 2008, the auctions for most of these instruments failed, and, therefore, the Company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model, which qualify the instruments as Level 3. The Companys analyses consider, among other items, the collateralization underlying the security investments, the expected future cash flows, including the final maturity, associated with the securities, and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to par value. In association with this estimate of fair value, the Company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of $17 million, with an offsetting entry to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Given the quality and backing of the Companys auction rate securities held, the fact that the Company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments, and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments in the auction process, it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary. These conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods. The Company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the U.S. Government. In addition, these auction rate securities represented less than three percent of the Companys total cash, cash equivalent, and investment balance at December 31, 2010, which the Company believes allows it sufficient time for the auction rate securities to return to full value. At the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter 2008, the Company held a total of $463 million in auction rate securities. Since that time, the Company has been able to sell $353 million of these instruments at par value. The Company also remains in discussions with its remaining counterparties to determine whether mutually agreeable terms can be reached regarding the effective repurchase of its remaining securities. The Company determines the value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing a standard option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are quoted by its counterparties. In situations where the Company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties, it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared. The Company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds. Due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable (primarily volatility), the Company has categorized these option contracts as Level 3. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective, as defined, are offset within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the period in which the expected cash flow impacts earnings. Any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective, as defined, or that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are reflected in earnings within Other (gains) losses, net, in the period of the change. Because the Company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds, and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash, the Company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the Companys derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the Companys financial statements. In addition, the Company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements, which provide for parties (or the Company) to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels. Since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the Companys outstanding fuel derivative contracts, this provides further validation to the Companys estimate of fair values. 57 Table of Contents Frequent flyer accounting The Company utilizes estimates in its recognition of liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program. These estimates include the liability associated with frequent flyer awards that have been issued, are outstanding, and are expected to be redeemed at a future date, amounts associated with partially earned awards that are expected to turn into fully earned awards and be redeemed at a future date, and amounts associated with frequent flyer credits sold to companies participating in its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. The Company utilizes the incremental cost method of accounting for frequent flyer awards issued and for partially earned awards (i.e., flight credits) earned in the Companys Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. The term partial award refers to flight credits earned by Customers for flights taken that in the aggregate are less than the amount needed to earn a frequent flyer award. The Company records a liability and reduction of Passenger revenue for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel as frequent flyer awards and partially earned awards are being earned. The liability recorded by the Company represents the total number of awards and partially earned awards expected to be redeemed by Customers. The estimated incremental cost of these liabilities include direct Passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other operational costs, but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit. Prior to 2010, the Company did not record a liability for partially earned Customer awards. However, effective January 1, 2010, the Company made a voluntary change in its accounting for frequent flyer benefits to begin accruing for partially earned frequent flyer awards. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this accounting change. At December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately 13.9 million full or partial awards outstanding, of which approximately 10.9 million were partially earned awards. The Company also sells frequent flyer credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program. Funds received from the sale of flight segment credits are accounted for under the residual method. Under this method, as of December 31, 2010, the Company has estimated that approximately 83 percent of the amount received per flight segment credit sold relates to free travel, and the remaining 17 percent associated with items such as access to the Companys frequent flyer program population for marketing/solicitation purposes, use of the Companys logo on co branded credit cards, and other trademarks, designs, images, etc. of the Company for use in marketing materials. This apportionment of value between free travel and marketing services is estimated based on several factors, including fares, the habits of Customers in redeeming awards for free travel, and the contractual rate paid by companies for the flight segment credits. Prior to 2010, the amount estimated to be associated with free travel had historically ranged from 75 percent to 82 percent. The estimated amounts associated with free travel are deferred and recognized as Passenger revenue when the ultimate free travel awards are flown or the credits expire unused. For the portion of funds received that is deemed not to be associated with future travel, the Company has determined that the period earned is the period in which the Company has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner, which is on a monthly or quarterly basis, upon sale, as the related marketing services are performed or provided. The vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted, either monthly or quarterly, to various lists of the Companys frequent flyer members. The estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in Other revenue in the period earned. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet, and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program. In addition, 16 of the leased aircraft in the Companys fleet have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates. The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. The Company has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases. The Company operates a total of 97 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, except for the 16 aircraft that have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates, the remainder of the Companys leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Hedging The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. Excluding the impact of the anticipated AirTran acquisition, the Company expects to consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2011. Based on this usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $15 million per year, excluding any impact of the Companys derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2010, the Company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that represented a hedge for a portion of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from 2011 through 2014. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company may increase or decrease the size of its fuel hedge based on its expectation of future market prices, as well as its perceived exposure to cash collateral requirements contained in the agreements it has signed with various counterparties. In 2010, the Company added to its fuel hedging position related to expected future fuel purchases. The total net fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2010, was a net asset of $207 million. This balance consists of the market value of fuel derivative instruments totaling a net asset of $142 million, and is net of $125 million in cash collateral that has been provided by the Company to one counterparty and $60 million in cash collateral held from another counterparty. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate 10 percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2010 (for all years from 2011 through 2014) prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately $370 million. Fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. In addition, this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties, which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount, depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2010 levels, except underlying futures prices. The Companys credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the Company. At such times, these outstanding instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had four counterparties in which the derivatives held were a net asset, totaling 59 Table of Contents $383 million. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. However, if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the Company and were unable to meet their obligations, any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination, which could result in substantial losses for the Company. At December 31, 2010, the Company had agreements with all of its counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterpartys credit rating. The Company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the Company, or is posted by the Company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the Company. The following table provides the fair values of fuel derivatives, amounts posted as collateral, and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of December 31, 2010, at which such postings are triggered: Counterparty (CP) (in millions) A B C D E Other Total Fair value of fuel derivatives $ 114 $ (238 ) $ (3 ) $ 79 $ 189 $ 1 * $ 142 Cash collateral held by CP (60 ) 125 65 Aircraft collateral pledged to CP 113 113 If credit rating is investment grade, fair value of fuel derivative level at which: Cash is provided to CP 0 to (300) or &gt;(700) 0 to (125) or &gt;(535) &gt;(75 ) &gt;(75 ) &gt;(75 ) Cash is received from CP &gt;40 &gt;150 &gt;200 *** &gt;125 *** &gt;250 Aircraft is pledged to CP (300) to (700) (125) to (535) N/A N/A N/A If credit rating is non investment grade, fair value of fuel derivative level at which: Cash is provided to CP 0 to (300) or &gt;(700) 0 to (125) or &gt;(535) ** ** ** Cash is received from CP ** ** ** ** ** Aircraft is pledged to CP (300) to (700) (125) to (535) N/A N/A N/A * Sum of counterparties with fair value of fuel derivatives &lt;$5M and no risk of the Company posting collateral. ** Cash collateral is provided at 100 percent of fair value of fuel derivative contracts. *** Thresholds may vary based on changes in credit ratings within investment grade. At December 31, 2010, the $60 million in cash collateral deposits held by the Company has been netted against the noncurrent fuel derivative assets from that counterparty within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The $125 million in cash collateral deposits provided by the Company to one counterparty has been netted against the noncurrent fuel derivative liabilities from that counterparty within Other non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the terms of the Companys current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties and the types of derivatives held, in the Companys judgment, it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements. As an example, if market prices for the commodities used in the Companys fuel hedging activities were to decrease by 33 percent from market prices as of December 31, 2010, given the Companys fuel derivative portfolio, its aircraft collateral facilities, and its investment grade credit rating, it would have to provide an additional $497 million in cash collateral to its current counterparties. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 60 Table of Contents During January 2011, the Company made the decision to forego its option under the agreement with one counterparty (Counterparty B in the above table) to use some of its aircraft as collateral in lieu of cash and has provided additional cash to that counterparty to meet its collateral obligation based on the fair value of its outstanding fuel derivative instruments. This decision, which can be changed at any time under the existing agreement with that counterparty, was made because the Company has an adequate amount of cash on hand available to cover its total collateral requirement and has determined it would be less costly to provide the cash instead of aircraft, due to the nominal additional charges it must pay if aircraft are utilized as collateral. The additional amount of cash provided as of January 19, 2011, was $108 million. The Company also has agreements with each of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements in which cash collateral may be required based on the fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps, as well as the Companys and its counterpartys credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010, no cash collateral had been provided to or received from counterparties associated with the Companys interest rate derivatives. If the Companys credit rating had been below investment grade as of December 31, 2010, it would have been required to provide $4 million in cash collateral to one counterparty based on its outstanding net liability derivative position with that counterparty. The outstanding interest rate net derivative positions with all other counterparties at December 31, 2010 were assets to the Company. Due to the significance of the Companys fuel hedging program and the emphasis that it places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk, the Company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels. For example, the Company has put in place controls designed to: (i) create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy; (ii) provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management; (iii) provide for proper segregation of duties; (iv) maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments; and (v) have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities. The Company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program. Financial market risk The vast majority of the Companys assets are aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions. While the Company uses financial leverage, it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a BBB rating with Fitch and Standard & Poors, and a Baa3 credit rating with Moodys as of December 31, 2010. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings were originally issued as floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2010, this included the Companys $385 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2012, the $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, the $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017, the $100 million 7.375% senior unsecured debentures due 2027, the $400 million 10.5% secured notes due 2011, and the $300 million 5.75% senior unsecured Notes due 2016. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys short term and long term debt. 61 Table of Contents Excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate as previously noted, the Company had no fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2010. The following table displays the characteristics of the Companys secured fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2010: Principalamount(in millions) Effectivefixed rate Finalmaturity Underlying collateral Term Loan Agreement $ 115 6.840 % 7/1/2019 5 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 296 6.640 % 5/6/2019 14 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 522 5.223 % 5/9/2020 21 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft The carrying value of the Companys floating rate debt totaled $2.0 billion, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 4 years at floating rates averaging 3.3 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. In total, the Companys fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 12 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of total noncurrent assets at December 31, 2010. In January 2011, the Company terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and its $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017. The effect of these terminations is basically that the interest associated with these debts prospectively revert back to their original fixed rates. As a result of the gains realized on these transactions, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the corresponding notes, and based on projected interest rates at the date of termination, the Company does not believe its future interest expense, based on projected future interest rates at the date of termination, associated with these notes will significantly differ from the expense it would have recorded had the notes remained at floating rates. Although there is no longer interest rate risk associated with these notes, the Company will subsequently be exposed to the fair value risk over their remaining terms. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $1.3 billion, and short term investments, which totaled $2.3 billion, at December 31, 2010. See Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company currently invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money market instruments, investment grade commercial paper, and other highly rated financial instruments, depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements. As a result of turmoil in credit markets, the Company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2010, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt, invested cash (excluding cash collateral deposits held, if applicable), floating rate aircraft leases, and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2010, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical 10 percent change in those rates would have an immaterial impact to the Companys net earnings and cash flows. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance (excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties, if applicable), short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2010, an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a 10 percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility, and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements, the pricing related to any funds 62 Table of Contents drawn under its revolving credit facility, and some of its hedging counterparty agreements. Certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings. The Companys revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations, as defined. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility, there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility, or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written. Five of the Companys hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the Companys credit rating falls below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies, and if the Company were in a net liability position with the counterparties including one counterparty in which the Company had posted $125M as if December 31 2010. See note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2010, there was no cash posted with any other counterparties. The Company was in a net fuel hedge liability position with one counterparty at December 31, 2010 in which no cash was posted. Assuming its credit rating were below investment grade as of that date, the Company would have been required to post approximately $3 million in cash collateral deposits with that counterparty. The Company currently has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its Customers utilizing American Express, Discover and MasterCard/VISA. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the Company soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor would have liability if the Company does not ultimately provide the air travel. Under these processing agreements, and based on specified conditions, increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty. A majority of the Companys sales transactions are processed by Chase Paymentech. Should chargebacks processed by Chase Paymentech reach a certain level, proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur. Additionally, cash reserves are required to be established if the Companys credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade. Cash reserve requirements are based on the Companys public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the Companys Air traffic liability. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements. However, the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The Company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future. 63 Table of Contents
