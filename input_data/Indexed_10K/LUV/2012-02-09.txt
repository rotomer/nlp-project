(a) Amounts net of profitsharing impact on charges incurred through March 31, 2011. The Company amended its profitsharing plan during second quarter 2011 to defer the profitsharing impact of acquisition and integration costs incurred from April 1, 2011, through December 31, 2013. The profitsharing impact of these costs will be realized in 2014 and beyond. (b) Amounts net of taxes and profitsharing. See footnote (a) above. 44 Table of Contents Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These GAAP financial statements include (i) unrealized non cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non GAAP financial information, including results that it refers to as economic, which the Companys management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Companys economic financial results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the Companys actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. These economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Companys fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Companys management, as well as investors, to consistently assess the Companys operating performance on a year over year or quarter over quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Further information on (i) the Companys fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and or mark to market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to its economic financial measures, as defined above, the Company has also provided other non GAAP financial measures as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include 2011 and 2010 charges of $134 million and $8 million, respectively, (before the impact of profitsharing and or taxes) related to expenses associated with the Companys acquisition and integration of AirTran, a 2011 charge of $17 million (before the impact of profitsharing and or taxes) for an asset impairment related to the Companys decision not to equip its Classic (737 300/500) aircraft with Required Navigation Performance (RNP) capabilities, and a 2009 charge of $66 million (before profitsharing and or taxes) related to Freedom 09, a voluntary early retirement program. The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared to prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. As a result of the Companys acquisition of AirTran, which closed on May 2, 2011, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non GAAP results. See Note 2 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the AirTran acquisition and Freedom 09, respectively. YEAR IN REVIEW For the 39th consecutive year, the Company was profitable, earning $178 million ($.23 per share, diluted) in 2011, compared to the Companys 2010 net income of $459 million ($.61 per share, diluted). On a non GAAP 45 Table of Contents basis, the Companys 2011 net income was $330 million ($.43 per share, diluted), which was below the Companys 2010 net income of $550 million ($.74 per share, diluted), on a non GAAP basis. Operating income for 2011 was $693 million, which was a 29.9 percent decrease versus 2010. On a non GAAP basis, the Companys 2011 operating income was $839 million, or 28.1 percent lower than 2010. See the previous Note Regarding the Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures. The decline in both net income and operating income, on both a GAAP and a non GAAP basis, primarily was attributable to higher fuel costs. In fact, a 33.5 percent increase in the Companys economic jet fuel cost per gallon compared to 2010 drove the majority of an over $2 billion year over year increase in economic Fuel and oil expense. However, the Company was able to combat the persistently high fuel costs by generating a 29.4 percent increase in operating revenues, thus enabling the Company to remain profitable. As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for GAAP reporting, the accompanying results of operations and cash flows contain AirTrans results beginning as of the date of the acquisition, while the prior year includes only the results of Southwest for all periods presented. In certain discussions that follow, primarily those involving forward looking information used in the projection of future results, the Company has chosen to make comparisons to prior year combined results or measures in order to provide more meaningful information since all future results for Southwest will include AirTran results. Prior year combined results consist of the combination of Southwest and AirTran stand alone results, without any retrospective application of acquisition related accounting adjustments. The Company focused a significant amount of its efforts during 2011 on various revenue improvement initiatives. The Companys major strategic initiatives include: The acquisition and integration of AirTran in order to grow the Companys network, gain access to key markets, and gain synergies through optimization of the combined carriers operations; Implementation of Southwests All New Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program, which took place in first quarter 2011 and which has exceeded the Companys expectations with respect to the number of frequent flyer members added, the amount spent per member on airfare, the number of flights taken by members, the number of Southwests co branded Chase Visa credit card holders added, and the number of frequent flyer points purchased by program members; The addition of a larger aircraft, the Boeing 737 800, to Southwests fleet, which is scheduled to begin in first quarter 2012 and is expected to allow the Company to profitably expand to new destinations, including near international locations, generate additional revenue by replacing current aircraft on specified routes and locations that are restricted due to space constraints or slot controls, and operate at a lower seat mile cost; Acceleration of the Companys fleet modernization efforts. The Company announced in December 2011, that it will be the first airline to accept delivery of Boeings new, more fuel efficient 737 MAX, which is expected to enter service in 2017. In connection with its fleet modernization program, the Company placed orders for a total of 150 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and added a total of 58 Boeing 737NG aircraft to its existing firm order book. The 737 MAX is expected to reduce CO2 emissions and improve fuel burn by an additional 10 to 11 percent over todays most fuel efficient, single aisle airplane. In January 2012, the Company also announced plans to retrofit its 737 700 fleet with an updated cabin interior. Evolve: The New Southwest Experience is intended to enhance Customer comfort, personal space, and the overall travel experience, while improving fleet efficiency and being environmentally responsible. By maximizing the space inside the plane, Evolve allows for the added benefit of six additional seats on each 737 700 aircraft, along with more climate friendly and cost effective materials. These retrofits for Southwest 737 700 aircraft are expected to begin in March 2012 and to be completed in 2013. The Company plans to retrofit the AirTran current fleet of 737 700s as such aircraft are converted to the Southwest livery beginning in 2012. Evaluation of short term and long term options to eventually replace Southwests reservation system, which is currently limited to domestic service. This will allow the Company to add international destinations, as well as other important Customer Service automations and functionality. 46 Table of Contents Each of these initiatives is expected to contribute significant incremental revenues once fully implemented. The Company currently believes the acquisition of AirTran has the potential to yield net annual synergies of more than $400 million in 2013, not including acquisition and integration costs. The Company incurred $134 million in acquisition and integration expenses in 2011. Excluding acquisition and integration expenses estimated to total approximately $500 million through 2014, the transaction was modestly accretive to the Companys earnings in 2011, excluding special items, is expected to be accretive in 2012, and is expected to be strongly accretive thereafter, upon full realization of the estimated net synergies. In addition, although Southwest and AirTran currently continue to operate as two separate airlines, the two carriers remain complementary with little route overlap. Strategically, both carriers have placed an emphasis on outstanding Customer Service, high quality low cost operations, solid low fare brands, and strong Employee cultures. The Company continues to make progress with the integration of AirTran into its operations and existing processes. The Company has moved the vast majority of AirTrans headquarters functions from Orlando to Dallas and expects to have approval from the FAA to achieve a single operating certificate in the first quarter of 2012. The Company has begun converting space in airports where both carriers operate and plans to begin converting AirTrans fleet to the Southwest livery beginning in the first quarter of 2012. The Company has begun optimizing AirTrans network, and is also planning to launch booking tools in 2012 to allow Customers of both airlines to book flights on either carrier via southwest.com or airtran.com and to integrate the frequent flyer programs of the carriers. Also, in fourth quarter 2011, the Company announced that the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), the union representing Southwest Pilots, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the union representing the pilots of AirTran, and the Company reached an agreement to integrate the two Pilot groups seniority lists. The agreement was approved by SWAPAs Board of Directors and ALPAs Master Executive Council and was ratified by the membership of each union. In December 2011, the Transportation Workers of America, AFL CIO, Local 556 (TWU 556), the union that represents Southwest Flight Attendants, the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), the union that represents AirTran Flight Attendants, and the Company reached an agreement to integrate the two Flight Attendant groups seniority lists. TWU 556s Executive Board and AFAs Master Executive Council both approved the agreement. The agreement was ratified by the respective memberships in January 2012. The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA), the union representing Southwest Aircraft Mechanics, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 528 (IBT 528), the union representing the AirTran Mechanics, and the Company reached a tentative agreement subject to a ratification vote by the unions respective memberships. The agreement would integrate the two groups seniority lists and also create a single labor agreement. The membership of each union is currently considering the tentative agreement. The Transportation Workers of America, AFL CIO Local 557 (TWU 557), the union representing Southwest Flight Instructors, an Employee Committee representing the Flight Instructors of AirTran, and the Company reached an agreement to integrate the two groups seniority lists. TWU 557s Executive Committee and the Employee Committee representing the AirTran Flight Instructors voted to pass the agreement forward to their respective members. The agreement was ratified by the respective memberships in January 2012. Aside from the new destinations provided by the acquisition of AirTran, Southwest began service to three new markets during 2011 Charleston, South Carolina, Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina, and the New York New Jersey area through Newarks Liberty International Airport. The Company has also announced Southwest will begin service to Atlanta, Georgia during first quarter 2012. Atlanta is currently AirTrans largest hub, and the Company will enhance AirTrans existing service utilizing Southwest aircraft and connecting this important destination to Southwests vast domestic network. The efforts underway to fully integrate AirTrans network and schedule with Southwests are expected to be a multi year undertaking, but one that the Company believes will yield significant financial benefits. At the current time, the Company plans to continue its route network and schedule optimization efforts, but does not intend to grow its overall fleet size for 2012. The Company currently expects to receive 33 737 800 47 Table of Contents aircraft deliveries during 2012, 28 of which will be new aircraft from Boeing, and five of which will be new 737 800s that are being leased from a third party. The Company also expects to retire approximately 40 of its older 737 300s and 737 500s and expects 2012 ASMs to approximate the combined amount flown during 2011 by Southwest and AirTran. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 compared with 2010 The Companys consolidated net income of $178 million ($.23 per share, diluted) in 2011 decreased by $281 million, or 61.2 percent, compared to its 2010 net income of $459 million ($.61 per share, diluted). The results in each year were significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the Companys hedging activities. As a result of the fuel hedges the Company had in place during 2011 including those that settled during 2011 and those that will settle in future years the Company recognized a net total of $259 million in losses allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2010, the Company recognized a net total of $426 million in losses as a result of its fuel hedging activities, allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net. Each of these totals for 2011 and 2010 includes the net premium costs the Company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which are classified as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments. The Companys results for 2011 also included a charge for asset impairment of $17 million (before the impact of profitsharing or taxes) related to the Companys decision not to equip its Classic (737 300/500) aircraft with RNP capabilities and AirTran acquisition and integration related expenses of $134 million (before the impact of profitsharing or taxes). The Companys 2011 operating income of $693 million was lower than the Companys 2010 operating income of $988 million, as the 34.6 percent increase in operating expenses outpaced the 29.4 percent increase in operating revenues. Operating revenues The following table presents the consolidated operating revenues for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to prior year reported results, as well as a reconciliation of the impact of the AirTran acquisition on the comparative results (in millions, except for percentage changes): Year endedDecember 31, Dollarchange Dollar changeattributableto AirTranresults Dollar changeexcludingAirTranresults Percent changeexcludingAirTranresults 2011 2010 OPERATING REVENUES: Passenger $ 14,735 $ 11,489 $ 3,246 $ 1,742 $ 1,504 13.1 % Freight 139 125 14 14 11.2 Other 784 490 294 261 33 6.7 Total operating revenues $ 15,658 $ 12,104 $ 3,554 $ 2,003 $ 1,551 12.8 % Consolidated operating revenues increased by $3.6 billion, or 29.4 percent, compared to 2010. The majority of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of the results of AirTran following the May 2, 2011 acquisition. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, operating revenues for 2011 increased by $1.6 billion, or 12.8 percent, compared to 2010, primarily due to a $1.5 billion, or 13.1 percent, increase in Passenger revenues. Holding other factors constant, over 40 percent of the increase in Passenger revenues was attributable to the 5.5 percent increase in Southwests capacity, versus 2010. The remainder of the increase primarily was due to higher Passenger yields (Passenger revenues per RPM flown), as the Company implemented fare increases in an attempt to buffer a portion of the impact of higher fuel costs. The Companys load factor also increased 1.6 points to 80.9 percent in 2011, which was a record for the Company. These strong revenue results were achieved due to better revenue management techniques and 48 Table of Contents strategies, continued optimization of the Companys flight schedule to better match demand in certain markets, improving economic conditions, which led to higher demand for air travel versus 2010, and at times, targeted marketing campaigns in which the Company differentiated its product and service from competitors. For January 2012, the Company experienced a year over year increase in passenger unit revenues of approximately seven percent compared to passenger unit revenues on a combined basis in January 2011. Bookings and revenue trends, thus far, for the remainder of first quarter 2012 also remain strong. Consolidated Freight revenues increased by $14 million, or 11.2 percent, versus 2010, primarily due to higher average rates charged as a result of fuel surcharges and better economic conditions than the prior year. The Company currently expects freight revenues for first quarter 2012 to be in line with fourth quarter 2011 freight revenues. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Other revenues increased $33 million, or 6.7 percent, compared to 2010. This increase was due to revenues from initiatives, such as the Companys EarlyBird product, for which Customers can pay $10 to automatically receive an assigned boarding position before general checkin begins, and service charges for unaccompanied minors and pets. The increase in revenues from initiatives was partially offset by a year over year increase in the portion of the commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners that were classified as Passenger revenue. The classification of such amounts is influenced by average fares, among other factors. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys frequent flyer program. Other revenues for AirTran for the period following the acquisition included approximately $110 million in baggage fees collected from Customers. The Company expects consolidated Other revenues for first quarter 2012 to fall below combined results for first quarter 2011, due to a higher portion of expected revenues from business partners being classified as Passenger revenues. Operating expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2011 increased by $3.8 billion, or 34.6 percent, compared to 2010, while capacity increased 22.5 percent compared to 2010. The increase in consolidated operating expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of AirTrans 2011 operating expenses following the acquisition. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, operating expenses increased 17.0 percent. The following tables present the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2011 and 2010, and year over year dollar changes for the same periods showing a reconciliation of the impact of the AirTran acquisition on the comparative results, followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis: Year endedDecember 31, Per ASMchange Percentchange (in cents, except for percentages) 2011 2010 Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.62 3.76 (.14 ) (3.7 )% Fuel and oil 4.68 3.68 1.00 27.2 Maintenance materials and repairs .79 .76 .03 3.9 Aircraft rentals .26 .18 .08 44.4 Landing fees and other rentals .80 .82 (.02 ) (2.4 ) Depreciation and amortization .59 .64 (.05 ) (7.8 ) Acquisition and integration .11 .11 n.a.

Consolidated operating expenses per ASM (unit costs) for 2011 increased 9.9 percent compared to 2010. Over 89 percent of this year over year cost per available seat mile increase was due to higher fuel costs, as the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon increased 27.1 percent to $3.19, including the impact of hedging activity. An increase in acquisition and integration expenses (incurred by Southwest) of $98 million also contributed to the year over year increase in costs on both a dollar and a per ASM basis during 2011. On a non GAAP basis, the Companys 2011 consolidated operating expenses per ASM, excluding fuel, remained relatively flat compared to 2010. Based on current cost trends, the Company expects first quarter 2012 unit costs on a consolidated basis, excluding fuel, profitsharing, and special items, to increase compared to first quarter 2011s combined unit costs, excluding fuel, profitsharing, and special items. See the previous Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Salaries, wages, and benefits expense increased by $286 million for 2011 compared to 2010. The majority of the year over year increase was due to the increase in Southwests capacity and number of trips flown, which was partially offset by a decrease in profitsharing expense resulting from lower income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records for its fuel hedging program as well as acquisition and integration costs. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel hedging. Consolidated Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM for 2011 decreased 3.7 percent compared to 2010. On a per ASM basis, the majority of this decrease was due to AirTran unit costs for Salaries, wages, and benefits being significantly lower than Southwests. This decrease was partially offset by increases in average wage rates paid to the majority of Southwests workforce. Based on current cost trends and anticipated capacity, the Company expects consolidated Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM in first quarter 2012, excluding profitsharing, to increase from first quarter 2011s combined unit cost, excluding profitsharing. Southwests Materials Specialists (formerly known as Stock Clerks), totaling approximately 170 Employees, are subject to an agreement between the Company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 19 (IBT Local 19). During first quarter 2011, Southwests Materials Specialists ratified a new agreement that becomes amendable August 16, 2013. Southwests Aircraft Appearance Technicians, totaling approximately 240 Employees, are subject to a collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA), which became amendable in February 2009. The Company and AMFA had tentatively agreed on a new contract, but during July 2011, the Aircraft Appearance Technicians voted not to ratify the agreement. The Company will continue to engage in discussions on a new agreement with AMFA. 50 Table of Contents Southwests Dispatchers, totaling approximately 190 Employees, are subject to agreements between the Company and the Transportation Workers of America, AFL CIO, Local 550 (TWU 550), which became amendable in 2009. The Company is currently in discussions on a new agreement with TWU 550. Southwests Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents, totaling approximately 8,800 Employees, are subject to an agreement between the Company and the TWU Local 555 (TWU 555), which became amendable in June 2011. The Company is currently in discussions on a new agreement with TWU 555. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Fuel and oil expense for 2011 increased $1.2 billion, or 33.5 percent, versus 2010. On a per ASM basis, 2011 consolidated Fuel and oil expense increased by 27.2 percent versus 2010. Both of these increases were primarily due to a 27.1 percent increase in the Companys average fuel cost per gallon. On a consolidated basis, as a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and inclusive of accounting for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognized net losses totaling $64 million in 2011 in Fuel and oil expense relating to fuel derivative instruments versus net losses of $324 million recognized in Fuel and oil expense in 2010. These totals are inclusive of cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives, which were $63 million paid to counterparties in 2011 versus $153 million paid to counterparties for 2010. However, these totals exclude gains and or losses recognized from hedge ineffectiveness and from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, which impacts are recorded as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 13, 2012, on an economic basis, the Company had combined derivative contracts in place related to expected future fuel consumption at the following levels: Average WTI Crude Oil price per barrel Percent of estimated fuel consumptioncovered by fuel derivative contracts First Half 2012 Second Half 2012 $80 to $100 10 20% range $100 to $125 (1 ) approx. 50% $125 to $150 approx. 20% Above $150 less than 5% Percent of estimated fuel consumption Period covered by fuel derivative contracts at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels 2013 over 50% 2014 over 40% 2015 over 10% (1) For first half 2012, the Companys current estimated fuel consumption covered by fuel derivative contracts is minimal, with various fuel derivative contracts at WTI crude equivalent intervals between $80 and $150 per barrel. 51 Table of Contents As a result of prior hedging activities, the Company continues to have significant amounts frozen in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), and these amounts will be recognized in the Companys Statement of Income in future periods when the underlying fuel derivative contracts settle. The following table displays the Companys estimated fair value of remaining fuel derivative contracts on a consolidated basis (not considering the impact of the cash collateral provided to or received from counterparties See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information) as well as the amount of deferred gains/losses in AOCI at December 31, 2011, and the expected future periods in which these items are expected to settle and or be recognized in earnings (in millions): Year Fair value(liability) of fuelderivative contractsat December 31,2011 Amount of gains(losses) deferredin AOCI atDecember 31,2011 (net of tax) 2012 $ (189 ) $ (92 ) 2013 (14 ) (91 ) 2014 131 23 2015 28 (23 ) Total $ (44 ) $ (183 ) Based on forward market prices and the amounts in the above table (and excluding any other subsequent changes to the fuel hedge portfolio), the Companys jet fuel costs per gallon are expected to exceed market (i.e., unhedged) prices during some of these future periods. This is based primarily on expected future cash settlements associated with fuel derivatives, but excludes any impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market because they do not qualify for hedge accounting. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Assuming no changes to the Companys current fuel derivative portfolio, but including all previous hedge activity for fuel derivatives that have not yet settled, and considering only the expected net cash payments related to hedges that will settle, the Company is providing a sensitivity table for first quarter 2012, second quarter 2012, and second half 2012 jet fuel prices at different crude oil assumptions as of January 13, 2012, and for expected premium costs associated with settling contracts each period. Estimated difference ineconomic jet fuel price pergallon, above/(below) unhedgedmarket prices, including taxes Average WTI Crude Oil price per barrel 1Q 2012 2Q 2012 Second Half 2012 $75 $0.12 $0.12 $0.15 $90 $0.12 $0.09 $0.11 $99 (1) $0.12 $0.06 $0.06 $115 $0.12 $0.06 ($0.11) $130 $0.11 $0.06 ($0.28) Estimated premium costs (2) $6 million $5 million $37 million (1) Based on the first quarter 2012 average WTI forward curve and market prices as of January 13, 2012, and current estimated fuel consumption covered by fuel derivative contracts, first quarter 2012 economic fuel price per gallon, including taxes, is estimated to be approximately $3.35 per gallon, or $.12 above market prices. (2) Premium costs are recognized as a component of Other (gains) losses net. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Maintenance materials and repairs expense for 2011 increased $29 million, or 3.9 percent, on a dollar basis compared to 2010. This increase primarily was attributable to higher airframe expense associated with routine heavy maintenance checks. On a per ASM basis, consolidated Maintenance materials and repairs expense increased 3.9 percent primarily as a result of higher engine expense, as AirTrans Boeing 717 fleet has higher engine costs, on a flight hour basis, than Southwests 52 Table of Contents all Boeing 737 fleet. In October 2011, the Company amended its engine maintenance contracts with GE Engine Services. Previously, the engines on both its Classic fleet (737 300/500s) and its 737 700s were subject to power by the hour agreements under which the cost was based on the number of engine hours flown. The amended agreement for the Classic fleet no longer meets the risk transfer criteria of a power by the hour agreement, and thus expense will prospectively be recorded on a time and materials basis when an engine repair event takes place. The maintenance contract for the engines on the Companys 737 700 fleet was amended primarily to incorporate the 52 Boeing 737 700s from the AirTran acquisition and to extend the term of that agreement until December 31, 2021. The amendments to both maintenance contracts were effective October 1, 2011. The Company currently expects consolidated Maintenance materials and repairs expense per ASM for first quarter 2012 to be comparable to combined first quarter 2011 results, based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events, scheduled engine shop visits, Evolve retrofits, and projected engine hours flown. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Aircraft rentals expense for 2011 decreased $31 million, or 17.2 percent, on a dollar basis compared to 2010 as a result of amortization associated with the unfavorable aircraft lease liability created as part of purchase accounting adjustments based on the estimated fair value of AirTrans Boeing 717 leases. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the impact of this amortization, year over year expense decreased slightly on a dollar basis. Consolidated Aircraft rentals expense per ASM for 2011 increased 44.4 percent compared to 2010. This increase on a per ASM basis primarily was due to the fact that AirTran leases the majority of its aircraft fleet. Of the 140 aircraft in AirTrans fleet, over 70 percent are on operating leases, versus approximately 16 percent for Southwests fleet at December 31, 2011. The Company currently expects consolidated Aircraft rentals expense per ASM for first quarter 2012 to be comparable to fourth quarter 2011s consolidated results, based on expected amortization associated with the aforementioned unfavorable aircraft lease liability and lease rate reductions negotiated for the Boeing 717 leases. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Landing fees and other rentals expense for 2011 increased by $35 million, or 4.3 percent, on a dollar basis compared to 2010. The majority of the dollar increase was due to the increase in number of trips flown versus the same prior year period. On a per ASM basis compared to 2010, consolidated Landing fees and other rentals expense decreased by 2.4 percent. The decline on a per ASM basis primarily was due to higher than anticipated credits (refunds) received in 2011 as a result of airports audits of prior period payments. The Company currently expects consolidated Landing fees and other rentals expense for first quarter 2012 to be higher than the combined first quarter 2011 results on a per ASM basis. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Depreciation and amortization expense for 2011 increased $46 million, or 7.3 percent, on a dollar basis compared to 2010. Approximately 66 percent of this increase was due to the amortization associated with the intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of AirTran, such as customer relationships, trademarks, slots, domain name, and non compete agreements, and approximately 23 percent was due to large projects that have been placed into service, such as the Companys implementation of its All New Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. On a per ASM basis, consolidated Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 7.8 percent compared to 2010, primarily due to the majority of AirTrans fleet being on operating leases. For first quarter 2012, the Company currently expects consolidated Depreciation and amortization expense per ASM to increase compared to first quarter 2011s combined results, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets and the Companys plans to accelerate the retirement of its Classic fleet. On a consolidated basis for 2011, the Company incurred $134 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of AirTran. These costs primarily consisted of financial advisory fees and consulting, severance, technology, and facility integration expenses. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the results of AirTran following the acquisition, Other operating expenses for 2011 increased $211 million on a dollar basis compared to 2010. Approximately 20 percent of this increase was a result of 53 Table of Contents revenue related costs (such as credit card processing fees) associated with the 13.1 percent increase in Passenger revenues, approximately 17 percent was due to technology and consulting costs associated with completed and ongoing projects, and approximately 8 percent was a result of a $17 million asset impairment related to the Companys decision not to equip its Classic aircraft with RNP capabilities. On a consolidated basis, Other operating expenses per ASM for 2011 increased 7.6 percent compared to 2010. Approximately 31 percent of the increase per ASM was a result of revenue related costs and 16 percent was due to technology and consulting costs associated with projects. On a consolidated basis for first quarter 2012, the Company currently expects Other operating expenses per ASM to increase from first quarter 2011s combined results. Through the 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, the federal government has continued to provide renewable, supplemental, first party war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial rates and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market. The government provided supplemental coverage from the Wartime Act is currently set to expire on September 30, 2012. Although another extension beyond this date is expected, if such coverage is not extended by the government, the Company could incur substantially higher insurance costs or experience unavailability of adequate coverage in future periods. Other Consolidated Other expenses (income) include interest expense, capitalized interest, interest income, and other gains and losses. Consolidated Interest expense for 2011 increased by $27 million, or 16.2 percent, compared to 2010. The additional debt held by the Company in connection with the AirTran acquisition resulted in $26 million additional interest expense for 2011. For first quarter 2012, the Company expects interest expense to decline from fourth quarter 2011s $51 million, primarily as a result of the redemption of the Companys $400 million 10.5% notes on December 15, 2011. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated Capitalized interest for 2011 decreased by $6 million, or 33.3 percent, compared to 2010, primarily due to a decrease in average progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries. Consolidated Interest income for 2011 decreased by $2 million, or 16.7 percent, compared to 2010, primarily due to lower rates earned on invested cash and short term investments. Consolidated Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the Companys hedging activities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods $ 21 $ (21 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods 33 (11 ) Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses 35 (1 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts 107 134 Other 2 5 $ 198 $ 106 Income taxes The Companys consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 45 percent for 2011, compared to 38 percent for 2010. The higher rate for 2011 primarily was driven by the Companys lower 2011 income before taxes (thus enhancing the impact of permanent tax differences), a portion of acquisition related costs being non deductible, additional income tax expense of $5 million as a result of an IRS settlement agreed to in first quarter 2011 related to tax years 2007 through 2009, and a first quarter 2011 $2 million charge as a result of a 54 Table of Contents State of Illinois tax law change. On a non GAAP basis, the Company currently projects a full year 2012 effective tax rate of approximately 38 to 40 percent based on currently forecasted financial results. However, the Companys effective tax rate during interim periods of 2012 may differ significantly from this full year estimate.

See previous Note Regarding Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures. 2010 compared with 2009 The Companys consolidated net income of $459 million ($.61 per share, diluted) in 2010 represented an increase of $360 million, or 364 percent, compared to its 2009 net income of $99 million ($.13 per share, diluted). The results in each year were significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge program and the 55 Table of Contents accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the Companys hedging activities. As a result of the fuel hedges the Company had in place during 2010 including those that settled during 2010 and those that will settle in future years the Company recognized a net total of $426 million in losses allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2009, the Company recognized a total of $408 million in losses as a result of its fuel hedging activities, allocated between Fuel and oil expense and Other (gains) losses, net. Each of these totals for 2010 and 2009 includes the net premium costs the Company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which are classified as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments. The Companys results for 2009 also included a one time charge of $66 million (before the impact of profitsharing or taxes) related to Freedom 09, a voluntary early retirement program that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this program. The Companys 2010 operating income was $988 million, which was significantly better than the Companys 2009 operating income of $262 million, as the 16.9 percent increase in operating revenues outpaced the 10.2 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating revenues Consolidated operating revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 16.9 percent, primarily due to a $1.6 billion, or 16.1 percent, increase in Passenger revenues. The majority of the increase in Passenger revenues was attributable to the 10.8 percent increase in Passenger yield (Passenger revenues per RPM flown), primarily due to higher average fares. The Companys load factor also increased 3.3 points to 79.3 percent in 2010. These strong revenue results were achieved due to better revenue management techniques and strategies, improving economic conditions which led to higher demand for air travel versus 2009, including a new and improved website at www.southwest.com, capacity restraint and reallocation by both the Company and the entire airline industry, fare increases, and targeted marketing campaigns designed to enhance the Companys already strong Brand and Customer Experience. Consolidated Freight revenues increased $7 million, or 5.9 percent, versus 2009, primarily due to higher average rates charged as a result of better economic conditions. Other revenues increased $150 million, or 44.1 percent, compared to 2009. Approximately 63 percent of the increase was due to revenues from initiatives, such as the Companys EarlyBird product, for which Customers can pay $10 to automatically receive an assigned boarding position before general checkin begins, and service charges for unaccompanied minors and for pets. The remainder of the increase primarily was due to higher commissions earned from programs the Company sponsors with certain business partners, such as Southwests co branded Chase Visa credit card. Operating expenses Consolidated operating expenses for 2010 increased $1.0 billion, or 10.2 percent, compared to a slight increase in capacity. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following presents the Companys operating expenses per ASM for 2010 and 2009 followed by explanations of these changes on a per ASM basis and or on a dollar basis (in cents, except for percentages): Year ended December 31, Per ASMchange Percentchange (in cents, except for percentages) 2010 2009 Salaries, wages, and benefits 3.76 3.54 .22 6.2 % Fuel and oil 3.68 3.11 .57 18.3 Maintenance materials and repairs .76 .73 .03 4.1 Aircraft rentals .18 .19 (.01 ) (5.3 ) Landing fees and other rentals .82 .73 .09 12.3 Depreciation and amortization .64 .63 .01 1.6 Other operating expenses 1.45 1.36 .09 6.6 Total 11.29 10.29 1.00 9.7 % 56 Table of Contents The Companys 2010 CASM (cost per available seat mile) increased 9.7 percent compared to 2009. Over 55 percent of this year over year CASM increase was due to an 18.4 percent increase in the Companys average jet fuel cost per gallon. The Companys 2009 operating expenses also included the impact of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company, which resulted in a $66 million charge. Excluding the impact of this charge, 2010 integration costs incurred in preparation for the acquisition of AirTran, and Fuel and oil expense for each year, 2010 CASM increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher wage rates, higher profitsharing expense, and higher airport costs. Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $236 million on an absolute dollar basis, including the impact of the $66 million charge recorded during third quarter 2009 as a result of Freedom 09, the early retirement plan offered by the Company that was accepted by 1,404 Employees. Excluding the impact of the Freedom 09 charge, approximately 55 percent of the year over year increase was from higher salaries and wages, primarily as a result of higher average wage rates. The remainder of the year over year increase primarily was attributable to a $124 million increase in profitsharing, as a result of higher income available for profitsharing. The Companys profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the Company records for its fuel hedging program. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fuel hedging. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense per ASM was 6.2 percent higher than 2009, primarily due to pay scale increases as a result of increased seniority and contractual rate increases for the Companys unionized workforce, who make up the majority of its Employees, while the Companys ASM capacity increased only slightly compared to 2009. These increases combined with relatively flat headcount resulted in higher average rates per Employee. Fuel and oil expense increased $576 million, or 18.9 percent, and on a per ASM basis increased 18.3 percent versus 2009. Both the dollar and the per ASM increase were driven primarily by an 18.4 percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel, including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging, and including related taxes. As a result of the Companys fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of the accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognized net losses totaling $324 million in 2010 in Fuel and oil expense relating to fuel derivative instruments versus net losses of $467 million recognized in Fuel and oil expense in 2009. These totals are inclusive of cash settlements realized from the expiration/settlement of fuel derivatives, which were $153 million paid to counterparties in 2010 versus $245 million paid to counterparties for 2009. However, these totals exclude gains and or losses recognized from hedge ineffectiveness, which are recorded as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Maintenance materials and repairs increased 4.5 percent on a dollar basis, and increased 4.1 percent on a per ASM basis compared to 2009. On both a dollar and a per ASM basis, the increases were due to an increase in the number of scheduled airframe maintenance events versus 2009. Aircraft rentals expense per ASM decreased 5.3 percent and, on a dollar basis, decreased $6 million. Both decreases primarily were due to the renegotiation of several aircraft leases at lower rates. Landing fees and other rentals increased $89 million on a dollar basis and increased 12.3 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2009. The majority of both the dollar increase and per ASM increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of higher rates charged by those airports due to either higher operating costs or to cover shortfalls caused by reductions in service by airlines over the past few years. When airlines reduce their capacity, airport costs are then allocated amongst a fewer number of total flights. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12 million on a dollar basis compared to 2009, and was up 1.6 percent on a per ASM basis. These increases were both primarily due to the amortization of capitalized software costs associated with various information technology upgrade and replacement projects the Company completed during 2010. Other operating expenses increased $89 million, and were up 6.6 percent on a per ASM basis, compared to 2009. On both a dollar and a per ASM basis, these increases primarily were due to an increase in revenue related costs (such as credit card interchange fees) associated with the 16.1 percent increase in Passenger revenues. 57 Table of Contents Other Interest expense decreased by $19 million, or 10.2 percent, primarily due to the Companys conversion of its $400 million of 10.5% secured notes due 2011 and its $300 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2016 to floating interest rates during fourth quarter 2009. Capitalized interest declined 14.3 percent, or $3 million, compared to 2009, due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $1 million, or 7.7 percent, primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances. Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the Companys fuel hedging activities. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Mark to market impact from fuel contracts settling in future periods $ (21 ) $ (73 ) Ineffectiveness from fuel hedges settling in future periods (11 ) (97 ) Realized ineffectiveness and mark to market (gains) or losses (1 ) (38 ) Premium cost of fuel contracts 134 148 Other 5 6 $ 106 $ (54 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys hedging activities. Income taxes The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 38 percent in 2010 from 40 percent in 2009. The lower 2010 rate primarily was due to the Companys higher 2010 earnings, which diluted the impact of permanent tax differences, thus reducing the tax rate. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES On a consolidated basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in 2011, compared to $1.6 billion provided by operating activities in 2010. Operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation to Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of airline operations. Operating cash flows can also be significantly impacted by the Companys fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, increases and or decreases to these cash deposits are reflected in operating cash flows as Cash collateral received from (provided to) fuel derivative counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, the net amount of cash provided to fuel hedge counterparties was $226 million, and the net change in cash deposits for 2011 was a net operating outflow of $195 million. Cash flows associated with entering into new fuel derivatives, which are also classified as operating cash flows, were net inflows of $192 million in 2011, net outflows of $359 million in 2010, and net outflows of $86 million in 2009. Cash flows from operating activities for 2011 were also significantly impacted by the Companys net income (as adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expense and non cash unrealized losses on fuel derivative instruments). For further information on the Companys hedging program and counterparty deposits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, respectively. Operating cash generated is used primarily to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and to provide working capital. 58 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities in 2011 totaled $1.1 billion, versus $1.3 billion used in 2010. Investing activities in both years included payments for new 737 700 aircraft delivered to the Company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries. The Company purchased 18 new Boeing 737 700 aircraft in 2011, versus the purchase of 11 Boeing 737 700s in 2010. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for 2011 and 2010 also reflect $48 million and $772 million, respectively, related to changes in the balance of the Companys short term investments. Net cash used in financing activities was $766 million in 2011. During 2011, the Company repaid $557 million in debt and capital lease obligations that came due, repurchased approximately $225 million of its outstanding common stock through a share repurchase program, and used $81 million in cash to repay convertible note holders following the acquisition of AirTran. Net cash used in financing activities was $149 million in 2010. During 2010, the Company repaid $155 million in debt and capital lease obligations that came due, and also repaid $44 million from a credit line borrowing associated with auction rate security instruments that were redeemed back to its counterparty. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The Company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. In addition to aircraft acquired as a result of the AirTran acquisition, the Company received 20 Boeing 737 700 aircraft in 2011, 18 of which were new aircraft purchased from Boeing and two of which were leased from a third party. The Company also retired ten older leased and owned 737 300 aircraft from service during 2011. During December 2011, the Company and Boeing announced a significant revision to the Companys future firm aircraft order book. Among other items, the revision included the incorporation of AirTrans future orders into the Companys agreement, the addition of 58 new 737NG firm orders, and the Companys placement of a firm order for 150 of Boeings new 737 MAX aircraft which is expected to enter service in 2017. In addition to these orders from Boeing, during July 2011, the Company executed an agreement to lease five new 737 800 aircraft from a third party. These aircraft are expected to be placed into service in mid 2012 and are expected to replace older aircraft, which are currently scheduled to be retired. Under the Companys agreement with Boeing, it has the option to substitute 737 600s for the 737 700s ordered with at least 24 months notice prior to the contractual delivery date and can substitute 737 800s for the 737 700s with at least twelve months notice. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete table of the Companys firm orders, options, and purchase rights with Boeing. For aircraft commitments with Boeing, the Company is required to make cash deposits toward the purchase of aircraft in advance. These deposits are classified as Deposits on flight equipment purchase contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the aircraft is delivered, at which time deposits previously made are deducted from the final purchase price of the aircraft and are reclassified as Flight equipment. The leasing of aircraft (including the sale and leaseback of aircraft) provides flexibility to the Company as a source of financing. Although the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and expense associated with operating leased aircraft, and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft, it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value (or market value) of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms. As of December 31, 2011, the Company, including AirTran, operated 199 leased aircraft, of which 192 are under operating leases. As prescribed by GAAP, assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the Companys leased aircraft is included below as well as in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the letters of credit are off balance sheet, the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $230 million at December 31, 2011. 59 Table of Contents The Company is a well known seasoned issuer and has a universal shelf registration statement that allows it to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. The Company intends to use the proceeds from any future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes. The Company has not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement to date. The following table aggregates the Companys (including AirTrans) material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011: Obligations by period (in millions) Contractual obligations 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Beyond2016 Total Long term debt (1) $ 556 $ 719 $ 816 $ 1,481 $ 3,572 Interest commitments fixed (2) 129 226 167 144 666 Interest commitments floating (3) 19 35 41 60 155 Operating lease commitments (4) 640 1,359 1,068 2,516 5,583 Capital lease commitments 6 12 12 26 56 Aircraft purchase commitments (5) 952 2,339 2,343 6,988 12,622 Other commitments 198 273 72 543 Total contractual obligations $ 2,500 $ 4,963 $ 4,519 $ 11,215 $ 23,197 (1) Includes principal only and includes $68 million associated with the Companys convertible senior notes due 2016. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Related to fixed rate debt only. (3) Interest obligations associated with floating rate debt (either at issuance or through swaps) is estimated utilizing forward interest rate curves as of December 31, 2011 and can be subject to significant fluctuation. (4) Includes LFMP commitment amounts. (5) Firm orders from Boeing. The Company has flexibility as to the timing for certain of the firm orders in 2013 through 2017, but has classified the amounts in the earliest year they could be considered a commitment. As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to incur approximately $500 million in integration and closing costs associated with the acquisition of AirTran, a portion of which were incurred in 2010 and 2011, and which have been, and are expected to continue to be, funded with cash. The Company believes that its current liquidity position, including unrestricted cash and short term investments of $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2011, anticipated future internally generated funds from operations, and its fully available, unsecured revolving credit facility of $800 million, will enable it to meet these future integration expenditures. Additionally, as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as set forth above in the contractual obligations table, the Company has long term debt maturities of $385 million in March 2012, which are currently expected to be funded with cash and short term investments on hand or expected to be generated from operations during 2012. The Company will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as needed. The Company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings, unencumbered assets, modest leverage, and consistent profitability, which should enable it to meet its ongoing capital, operating, and other liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2011, the book value of the Companys unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately $6.2 billion. In January 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys common stock. Through February 15, 2008, the Company had repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total of approximately $54 million, at which time repurchases under the program were suspended. On August 5, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to resume a share repurchase program and approved the Companys repurchase, on a discretionary basis, up to $500 million of the Companys common stock following such authorization. During 2011, the Company purchased approximately 27.5 million shares of its common stock for approximately $225 million of the $500 million in total currently authorized by the Board. 60 Table of Contents Repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. During 2008, the City of Dallas approved the Love Field Modernization Program (LFMP), a project to reconstruct Dallas Love Field (Airport) with modern, convenient air travel facilities. Pursuant to a Program Development Agreement (PDA) with the City of Dallas and the Love Field Airport Modernization Corporation (or LFAMC, a Texas non profit local government corporation established by the City to act on the Citys behalf to facilitate the development of the LFMP), the Company is managing this project. Major construction commenced during 2010, with completion of the project scheduled for the second half of 2014. Although subject to change, the project is expected to include the renovation of the Airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new 20 gate facility, including infrastructure, systems and equipment, aircraft parking apron, fueling system, roadways and terminal curbside, baggage handling systems, passenger loading bridges and support systems, and other supporting infrastructure. During fourth quarter 2010, the LFAMC issued $310 million in tax exempt facility revenue bonds (LFMP Bonds), the proceeds of which have been or will be used: (1) to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the LFMP; and (2) to reimburse the Company for approximately $80 million in early LFMP expenditures made (such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a June 25, 2008 Inducement Resolution approved by the Dallas City Council and subsequent Resolutions by the LFAMC). Repayment of the LFMP Bonds will be through the Facilities Payments described below. Reimbursement of the Company for its payment of Facilities Payments are expected to be made through recurring ground rents, fees, and other revenues collected at the Airport. The Company has guaranteed principal, premium, and interest on the issued bonds. Depending on funding needs and the timing of these funds from other sources, an additional tranche of bonds is expected to be issued during 2012. It is currently expected that the total amount spent on the LFMP project will be approximately $519 million. Prior to the issuance of the LFMP Bonds by the LFAMC, the Company entered into two separate funding agreements: (1) a Facilities Agreement pursuant to which the Company is obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the LFMP Bonds (Facilities Payments), less other sources of funds the City of Dallas may apply to the repayment of the LFMP Bonds (including but not limited to passenger facility charges collected from passengers originating from the Airport); and (2) a Revenue Credit Agreement pursuant to which the City of Dallas will reimburse the Company for the Facilities Payments made by the Company. A majority of the monies transferred from the City of Dallas to the Company under the Revenue Credit Agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the Use and Lease Agreement between the City of Dallas and the Company. The Use and Lease Agreement is a 20 year agreement providing for, among other things, the Companys lease of space at the Airport from the City of Dallas. The remainder of such monies transferred from the City of Dallas to the Company under the Revenue Credit Agreement is expected to originate from (1) use and lease agreements with other airlines, (2) various concession agreements, and (3) other Airport miscellaneous revenues. The Companys liquidity could be impacted by the LFMP to the extent there is not an additional future successful bond issuance or there is a timing difference between the Companys payment of the Facilities Payments pursuant to the Facilities Agreement and the transfer of monies back to the Company pursuant to the Revenue Credit Agreement; however, the Company does not currently anticipate the occurrence of either of these items. The LFMP is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys capital resources or financial position. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and accounting requirements related to the LFMP. 61 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Companys estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most subjective judgments. The Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue recognition Tickets sold for Passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and Air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in Air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. For air travel on Southwest, the amount of tickets that will expire unused are estimated and recognized in Passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed. Estimating the amount of tickets that will expire unused, be refunded, or exchanged involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of Southwests tickets sold are nonrefundable, which is the primary source of unused tickets. According to Southwests Contract of Carriage, tickets (whether refundable or nonrefundable) that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight, up to a year from the date of sale, or can be refunded (if the ticket is refundable). This policy also applies to unused Customer funds that may be left over from exchanging a less expensive ticket for a previously purchased ticket that was more expensive. A small percentage of tickets (or partial tickets) expire unused. Fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited. Estimates of tickets that will expire unused are based on historical experience over many years. Southwest and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of scheduled travel. Holding other factors constant, a 10 percent change in the Companys (including AirTrans) estimate of the amount of tickets that will expire unused would have resulted in a $37 million, or 0.25 percent, change in Passenger revenues recognized for 2011. Events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical Customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts. If actual refunds, exchanges, or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range, estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to Air traffic liability and to Passenger revenue are recorded, as necessary. Additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include, but may not be limited to, changes to the Companys ticketing policies, the Companys refund, exchange, and unused funds policies, the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares, promotional fare activity, and the impact of the economic environment on Customer behavior. The Companys estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual refund, exchange, and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts. During 2009, as a result of the Companys efforts to stimulate demand through fare sales, Passenger revenues consisted of a higher percentage of discount tickets flown and a lower percentage of fully refundable tickets flown. In addition, during 2011, the Company revised its unused funds policy to restrict the ability of a Customer to transfer funds to another Customer, which has resulted in an increase in expiration of unused funds. Consequently, the Companys estimate of the amount of refunded, exchanged, or forfeited tickets recorded during 2009 and during 2011 was approximately 30 to 35 percent higher than what it believes its historical averages would indicate for those years. The Company believes these estimates are supported by actual data and are reasonable given the underlying fact patterns. 62 Table of Contents The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds, exchanges, and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Accounting for long lived assets Flight equipment and related assets make up the majority of the Companys long lived assets. Flight equipment primarily relates to the 496 Boeing 737 aircraft and 10 Boeing 717 aircraft in the Companys (including AirTrans) fleet at December 31, 2011, which are either owned or on capital lease. The remaining 114 Boeing 737 aircraft and 78 Boeing 717 aircraft in the Companys (including AirTrans) fleet at December 31, 2011, are operated under operating leases. In accounting for long lived assets, the Company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and their future expected cash flows. The following table shows a breakdown of the Companys long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values for new assets generally purchased from the manufacturer: EstimatedUseful Life EstimatedResidual value Airframes and engines 23 to 30 years 5% 15% Aircraft parts Fleet life 4% Ground property and equipment 5 to 30 years 0% 10% In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, the Company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types, current and projected future market information, and recommendations from Boeing. Aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown (one take off and landing) as well as the aircraft age. The Company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to aircraft maintenance programs, changes in utilization of the aircraft (actual cycles during a given period of time), governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts these estimates and assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense. For example, during fourth quarter 2010, the Company changed the estimated residual values of its entire remaining fleet of owned 737 300 and 737 500 aircraft. Based on current and expected future market conditions related to these aircraft, the Company reduced the residual values of these aircraft from approximately 15 percent of original cost to approximately 10 percent of original cost. This determination was made due to the lack of buyers for these older aircraft, as many buyers of used aircraft prefer newer, more fuel efficient models, and the increase in the number of airlines retiring these older aircraft, which has increased the supply of older aircraft on the market. As this reduction in residual value is considered a change in estimate, it was accounted for on a prospective basis, and thus the Company has effectively accelerated the recording of depreciation expense over the remainder of the useful lives for each aircraft. The impact of this change was not material. The Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset(s), a significant change in the long lived assets physical condition, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset. The Company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft, generate positive cash flow, and produce operating profits. Consequently, the Company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives, expected residual values, and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. 63 Table of Contents Financial derivative instruments The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities, and see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments. All derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2011, the Company was a party to over 800 separate financial derivative instruments, related to its fuel hedging program, for the years 2012 through 2015. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices, as has been evident in recent years. For example, during 2010, market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of approximately $91 per barrel and hit a low price of approximately $68 per barrel. During 2011, market spot prices ranged from a low of $76 per barrel to a high of $114 per barrel. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, value of the U.S. dollar, geopolitical events, and general economic conditions, among other items. The financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, call spreads, and fixed price swap agreements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets. Since the majority of the Companys financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Also, since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel, the Company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices. Forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices (such as crude oil, heating oil, and unleaded gasoline) and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the Companys ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the Company hedges. Fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed, respectively. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. In some historical periods, because of increased volatility in energy markets, the Company has in fact lost hedge accounting for a certain type of commodity, such as all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments. There have also been instances in which the Company has lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for certain types of commodities used in hedging. At such times, the Company has marked all such derivatives to fair value in each quarterly period, with all changes in value reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company did not lose hedge accounting for an entire commodity during 2011, 2010, or 2009. Although the Companys prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that the commodities used in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. Increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time, especially if such volatility were to worsen, could cause the Company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program, which would create further volatility in the Companys financial results. Estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their fair values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment. To the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased, both on a cumulative and a period to period basis, ineffectiveness 64 Table of Contents of the fuel hedge can result. This could result in the immediate recording of non cash charges or income, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative, even though the derivative instrument may not expire/settle until a future period. Likewise, if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to Other (gains) and losses, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period of the change. Ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities, especially given the past volatility in the prices of refined products. Due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products, the Company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period, including the loss of hedge accounting, which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity. This may result, and has historically resulted, in increased volatility in the Companys financial statements. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during historical periods has been due to a number of factors. These factors include: the significant fluctuation in energy prices, the number of derivative positions the Company holds, significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products, and the volatility of the different types of products the Company uses for mitigation of fuel price volatility. The discontinuation of hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products, such as unleaded gasoline, can also be a result of these factors. Depending on the level at which the Company is hedged at any point in time, as the fair value of the Companys hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period, there could be continued variability recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and furthermore, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material. This is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large volumes. The Company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting expected future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program. These estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the Companys fuel hedges. The current methodology used by the Company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices, depending on specific geographic locations in which the Company hedges. The Company then adjusts for certain items, such as transportation costs, that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors, in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge. This methodology for estimating expected future cash flows (i.e., jet fuel prices) has been consistently applied during 2011, 2010, and 2009, and has not changed for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods. The Company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made. Fair value measurements The Company utilizes unobservable (Level 3) inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2011, these included auction rate security investments, valued at $67 million, a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts, which were a net asset of $417 million, and $5 million in other investments. All of the Companys auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In prior periods, due to the auction process which took place every 30 35 days for most securities, quoted market prices were readily available, which would have qualified as Level 1. However, due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter 2008, the auctions for most of these instruments failed, and, therefore, the Company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a 65 Table of Contents discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model, which qualify the instruments as Level 3. The Companys analyses consider, among other items, the collateralization underlying the security investments, the expected future cash flows, including the final maturity, associated with the securities, and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to par value. In association with this estimate of fair value, the Company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of $14 million, with an offsetting entry to AOCI. Given the quality and backing of the Companys auction rate securities held, the fact that the Company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments, and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments back to the issuer, it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary. These conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods. The Company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues, because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the U.S. Government. In addition, these auction rate securities represented less than two percent of the Companys total cash, cash equivalents, and investment balance at December 31, 2011, which the Company believes allows it sufficient time for the auction rate securities to return to full value. At the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter 2008, the Company held a total of $463 million in auction rate securities. Since that time, the Company has been able to redeem $382 million of these instruments at par value. The Company determines the fair value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are quoted by its counterparties. In situations where the Company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties, it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared. The Company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds. Due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable (primarily volatility), the Company has categorized these option contracts as Level 3. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective, as defined, are offset within AOCI until the period in which the expected future cash flow impacts earnings. Any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective, as defined, or that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are reflected in earnings within Other (gains) losses, net, in the period of the change. Because the Company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds, and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash, the Company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the Companys derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the Companys financial statements. In addition, the Company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements, which provide for parties (or the Company) to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels. Since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the Companys outstanding fuel derivative contracts, this provides further validation to the Companys estimate of fair values. Frequent flyer accounting Southwest and AirTran utilize estimates in the recognition of liabilities associated with their respective frequent flyer programs. These estimates primarily include the liability associated with frequent flyer member account balances that are expected to be redeemed for travel or other products at a future date, and frequent flyer awards that have been issued, are outstanding, and are expected to be redeemed at a future date. Frequent flyer account balances include points/credits earned through flights taken, points sold to Customers, or points/credits earned through business partners participating in the Companys frequent flyer program. 66 Table of Contents In March 2011, Southwest launched its All New Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program. Under the new program, members earn points for every dollar spent instead of credits for flight segments flown. The amount of points earned is based on the fare and fare class purchased, with higher fare products (e.g., Business Select) earning more points than lower fare products (e.g., Wanna Get Away). Each fare class is associated with a points earning multiplier, and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier. Likewise, the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight is based on the fare and fare class purchased. However, unlike Southwests previous program, under the new program, (i) members are able to redeem their points for every available seat, every day, on every flight, with no blackout dates; and (ii) points do not expire so long as the Rapid Rewards Member has points earning activity during a 24 month time period. In addition, Southwest co branded Chase Visa credit card holders are able to redeem their points for items other than travel on Southwest Airlines, such as international flights, cruises, hotel stays, rental cars, gift cards, event tickets, and more. In addition to earning points for revenue flights, Rapid Rewards Members also have the ability to purchase points. As part of Southwests transition to the new program, Southwest did not convert members account balances under the previous program, but is allowing members to continue to redeem those balances for award travel under the prior program rules for a period of time. AirTran operates its A+ Rewards frequent flyer program, which allows Customers the opportunity to earn free roundtrip travel awards or Business Class upgrades on AirTran flights. A+ Rewards credits are earned through flights, purchases made with an AirTran Airways A+ Visa card, qualifying car rentals from Hertz, purchases from other A+ Rewards partners, and in conjunction with certain marketing promotions. Under certain circumstances, Customers may also redeem frequent flyer awards for free travel on other airlines. Both Southwest and AirTran utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for points and or credits earned through flights taken in their respective frequent flyer programs. A liability is recorded for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel as points and or credits are being earned. The liability recorded represents the total number of points and or credits expected to be redeemed by members, regardless of whether the members may have enough to qualify for a full travel award. The incremental cost liability is primarily composed of direct Passenger costs such as fuel, food, and other operational costs, but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit. At December 31, 2011, Southwest and AirTrans consolidated incremental cost liability, including both the liability remaining from Southwests previous program and the liability associated with its new frequent flyer program, was approximately $66 million. Southwest and AirTran also sell frequent flyer points and or credits and related services to business partners participating in the respective frequent flyer programs. The majority of the points and or credits sold to business partners are through the Southwest co branded Chase Visa credit card or the AirTran A+ Visa Card. Funds received from the sale of points and or credits associated with these agreements are accounted for under the residual method. Although ASU No. 2009 13 Revenue Agreements with Multiple Deliverables disallows the use of the residual method with respect to new and modified revenue arrangements after its January 1, 2011, effective date, Southwest and AirTran are required to continue to utilize the residual method until such time as there is a material modification to such pre existing agreements. As a result, the adoption of ASU No. 2009 13 currently has no impact on Southwest or AirTran. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on ASU No. 2009 13. Under the residual method, as of December 31, 2011, Southwest estimates that approximately 92 percent of the amount received from frequent flyer points sold associated with Southwests co branded credit card relates to free travel, and the remaining 8 percent is associated with items such as access to its frequent flyer program population for marketing/solicitation purposes, use of the Southwests logo on the co branded credit cards, and other trademarks, designs, images, etc., of Southwest for use in marketing materials. This apportionment of value between free travel and marketing services is estimated based on several factors, including fares, the habits of Customers in redeeming free travel awards, and the contractual rate received for the points sold. Prior to 2011, the amount estimated to be associated with free travel had historically ranged from 75 percent to 82 percent. The estimated amounts associated with free travel are deferred and recognized as Passenger revenue when the ultimate free travel awards are flown or the amounts expire unused. For the portion of funds received that is deemed not to be associated with future travel, Southwest 67 Table of Contents has determined that the period revenue is recognized is the period in which it has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner, which is on a monthly or quarterly basis, upon sale, as the related marketing services are performed or provided. The vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted, either monthly or quarterly, to various lists of Southwests frequent flyer members. The estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in Other revenue in the period earned. For AirTran, 100 percent of amounts received for credits sold is estimated to relate to free travel and is deferred until the travel award is flown. Under its new program, Southwest continues to estimate the portion of frequent flyer points that will not be redeemed. These estimates are based on experience in its previous program and expectations of customer behavior given the rules of the new program. However, since the program is new, these estimates may result in significant adjustments based on actual experience. Goodwill and other intangible assets As a result of the Companys acquisition of AirTran on May 2, 2011, the Company has reflected Goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet in the amount of $970 million at December 31, 2011, representing the excess of the fair value of AirTrans assets and liabilities over its book value on the acquisition date. In addition, the Company carries other intangible assets totaling approximately $125 million at December 31, 2011, primarily consisting of leasehold rights to airport gates, take off and landing slots at certain domestic slot controlled airports, and certain intangible assets recognized as part of the valuation of AirTrans assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. All of the Companys intangible assets are finite lived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives. Goodwill is not amortized, but will be tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The Company has selected October 1 as its annual testing date and performed its initial annual Goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2011. The Company applies a fair value based methodology in testing the carrying value of Goodwill for its one reporting unit. Key assumptions and or estimates made in the Companys 2011 Goodwill impairment test included the following: 1) a long term projection of revenues, expenses, and cash flows; 2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9.5 percent; and 3) a tax rate of 38.5 percent. The Company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. However, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the Companys estimates. Future impairment of Goodwill may result from changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond the Companys control. Factors which could result in an impairment, holding other assumptions constant, could include, but are not limited to: 1) reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions; 2) higher prices for jet fuel; 3) lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand; 4) a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments; and 5) significant disruptions to the Companys operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities, actual or threatened war, labor actions by Employees, or further industry regulation. As a result of the tests performed during fourth quarter 2011, no impairment was determined to exist for Goodwill or any of the Companys finite lived intangible assets. In the Goodwill impairment analysis performed, the excess of fair value versus carrying value was estimated to be between 15 20 percent. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps, commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet, and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program and in the form of fixed rate debt instruments. As of December 31, 2011, Southwest and 68 Table of Contents AirTran operated a total of 199 aircraft under operating and capital leases. However, except for a small number of aircraft that have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates, the remainder of the leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and, therefore, are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below. Commitments related to leases are disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Companys accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the Companys financial derivative instruments. Hedging The Company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices, but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy. The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments, on both a short term and a long term basis, as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices. The Company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases. Inclusive of the operations of AirTran, the Company expects to consume approximately 1.9 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2012. Based on this anticipated usage, a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the Companys Fuel and oil expense by approximately $19 million for 2012, excluding any impact associated with fuel derivative instruments held. As of December 31, 2011, the Company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that represented a hedge for a portion of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from 2012 through 2015. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company may increase or decrease the size of its fuel hedge based on its expectation of future market prices, as well as its perceived exposure to cash collateral requirements contained in the agreements it has signed with various counterparties. The gross fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the Companys jet fuel market price risk at December 31, 2011, was a net liability of $44 million. In addition, a total of $226 million in cash collateral has been provided by the Company to three counterparties associated with these instruments. The fair values of the derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. An immediate 10 percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the December 31, 2011 (for all years from 2012 through 2015) prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately $400 million. Fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects. In addition, this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties, which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount, depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty. This sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at December 31, 2011 levels, except underlying futures prices. The Companys credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the Company. At such times, these outstanding instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had five counterparties in which the derivatives held were a net asset, totaling $200 million. To manage credit risk, the Company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements, and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty. However, if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the Company and were unable to meet their obligations, any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination, which could result in substantial losses for the Company. At December 31, 2011, the Company had agreements with all of its counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterpartys credit rating. The Company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits 69 Table of Contents and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the Company, or cash and or aircraft could be posted by the Company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the Company. Refer to the counterparty credit risk and collateral table provided in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair values of fuel derivatives, amounts posted as collateral, and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of December 31, 2011, at which such postings are triggered. At December 31, 2011, of the entire $226 million in cash collateral deposits posted with counterparties under the Companys bilateral collateral provisions, $41 million in cash collateral deposits has been netted against noncurrent fuel derivative instruments within Other noncurrent liabilities and $185 million in cash collateral deposits has been netted against current fuel derivative instruments within Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No aircraft were pledged as collateral at December 31, 2011. Due to the terms of the Companys current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties and the types of derivatives held, in the Companys judgment, it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements. As an example, if market prices for the commodities used in the Companys fuel hedging activities were to decrease by one third from market prices as of December 31, 2011, given the Companys fuel derivative portfolio, its aircraft collateral facilities, and its investment grade credit rating, it would likely provide an additional $700 million in cash and or aircraft collateral to its current counterparties. However, the Company would expect to also benefit from lower market prices paid for fuel used in its operations. The Company is also subject to the risk that the fuel derivatives it uses to hedge against fuel price volatility do not provide adequate protection. The majority of fuel derivatives in the Companys hedge portfolio are based on the market price of West Texas intermediate crude oil (WTI). During early 2011, the spread between WTI and jet fuel widened beyond historic norms, which led to more ineffectiveness when measuring the Companys hedges. During that time, jet fuel prices more closely correlated with changes in the price of Brent crude oil (Brent). During fourth quarter 2011, the spread between WTI and jet fuel narrowed from its 2011 high, but still remains higher than historic norms; however, there is no assurance that this spread will not expand again in the future. Although the Company has some fuel derivatives based on the price of Brent, to the extent the spread between jet fuel and WTI stays at current levels or widens from current levels, the Companys hedges could continue to be ineffective and not provide adequate protection against jet fuel price volatility. The Company also has agreements with each of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements in which cash collateral may be required based on the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments, as well as the Companys and its counterpartys credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011, $64 million had been provided to one counterparty associated with interest rate derivatives based on the Companys outstanding net liability derivative position with that counterparty. In addition, in connection with interest rate swaps entered into by AirTran, a total of $32 million in cash collateral had been provided to two counterparties at December 31, 2011, as a result of net liability derivative positions with those counterparties. The outstanding interest rate net derivative positions with all other counterparties at December 31, 2011, were assets to the Company. Due to the significance of the Companys fuel hedging program and the emphasis that the Company places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk, the Company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels. For example, the Company has put in place controls designed to: (i) create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy; (ii) provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management; (iii) provide for proper segregation of duties; (iv) maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments; and (v) have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities. The Company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program. 70 Table of Contents Financial market risk The vast majority of the Companys tangible assets are aircraft, which are long lived. The Companys strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions. While the Company uses financial leverage, it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a BBB rating with Fitch, a BBB rating with Standard & Poors, and a Baa3 credit rating with Moodys as of December 31, 2011, which are considered investment grade. The Companys 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings were originally issued as floating rate debt. In addition, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company and AirTran have converted certain of their long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements. Although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings, the risk for the 1999 and 2004 French Credit Agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company may prepay this debt under certain conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the material terms of the Companys, including AirTrans, short term and long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate, the Companys fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding included its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and its $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017. Both of these notes had previously been converted to floating rates, but in January 2011, the Company terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to them. The effect of these terminations was that the interest associated with these debts prospectively reverted back to their original fixed rates. As a result of the gains realized on these transactions, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the corresponding notes, and based on projected interest rates at the date of termination, the Company does not believe its future interest expense, based on projected future interest rates at the date of termination, associated with these notes will significantly differ from the expense it would have recorded had the notes remained at floating rates. Although there is no longer interest rate risk associated with these notes, the Company is now exposed to fair value risk over their remaining terms. The Company believes the fixed interest rates associated with its $350 million 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and its $300 million 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017 are comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years. The following table displays the characteristics of the Companys (including AirTrans) secured fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2011: Principalamount(in millions) Effectivefixed rate Finalmaturity Underlying collateral Term Loan Agreement $ 269 6.315 % 5/6/2019 14 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 106 6.84 % 7/1/2019 5 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft Term Loan Agreement 487 5.223 % 5/9/2020 21 specified Boeing 737 700 aircraft The carrying value of the Companys, including AirTrans, floating rate debt totaled $1.1 billion, and this debt had a weighted average maturity of 4.99 years at floating rates averaging 4.46 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011. In total, the Companys, including AirTrans, fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented 19.52 percent and 7.82 percent, respectively, of consolidated noncurrent assets at December 31, 2011. The Company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash, which totaled $829 million, and short term investments, which totaled $2.3 billion, at December 31, 2011. See Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company currently invests available cash in certificates of deposit, highly rated money market instruments, investment grade commercial paper, treasury securities, US government agency securities, and other highly rated financial instruments, depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements. As a result of turmoil in credit markets, the Company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities. Because of the short term nature of these investments, the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates. The Company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities. 71 Table of Contents A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates as of December 31, 2011, would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys, including AirTrans, fixed rate debt instruments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the fair value of financial instruments. A change in market interest rates could, however, have a corresponding effect on earnings and cash flows associated with the Companys, including AirTrans, floating rate debt, invested cash (excluding cash collateral deposits held, if applicable), floating rate aircraft leases, and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items. Assuming floating market rates in effect as of December 31, 2011, were held constant throughout a 12 month period, a hypothetical 10 percent change in those rates would have an immaterial impact to the Companys net earnings and cash flows. Utilizing these assumptions and considering the Companys cash balance (excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties, if applicable), short term investments, and floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows, while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the Companys earnings and cash flows. However, a 10 percent change in market rates would not impact the Companys earnings or cash flow associated with the Companys, including AirTrans, publicly traded fixed rate debt. The Company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility, and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements, the pricing related to any funds drawn under its revolving credit facility, and some of its hedging counterparty agreements. Certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings. The Companys revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations, as defined. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. However, if conditions change and the Company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility, there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility, or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written. Seven of the Companys hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the Companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies, and if the Company were in a net liability position with the counterparty. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had posted $226 million in cash with its fuel hedge counterparties, because the Company was in a net fuel hedge liability position with those counterparties. The Company had the option of substituting aircraft in lieu of $27 million in cash as of December 31, 2011, but opted to provide cash instead. If the Companys credit rating had been below investment grade as of that date, the Company would have been required to post approximately $53 million in additional cash collateral deposits with fuel hedge counterparties. The Company currently has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its Customers utilizing American Express, Discover and MasterCard/VISA. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the Company soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor will have liability if the Company does not ultimately provide the air travel. Under these processing agreements, and based on specified conditions, increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty. A majority of the Companys sales transactions are processed by Chase Paymentech. Should chargebacks processed by Chase Paymentech reach a certain level, proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur. Additionally, cash reserves are required to be established if the Companys credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade. Cash reserve requirements are based on the Companys public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the Companys Air traffic liability. 72 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements. However, the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The Company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future. 73 Table of Contents
