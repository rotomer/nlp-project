ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto: OVERVIEW Since its inception in 1991, Lexmark has become a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of printing and imaging solutions for offices and homes. Lexmarks products include laser printers, inkjet printers, multifunction devices, associated supplies, services and solutions. Lexmark also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms by business users and develops, manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products. The company is primarily managed along business and consumer market segments. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the companys reportable segments. The total distributed office and home printing output opportunity has expanded as copiers and fax machines have been integrated into multifunction devices. Management believes that the integration of print/copy/fax capabilities favors companies like Lexmark due to its experience in providing industry leading network printing solutions and multifunction printing products. Lexmarks management believes that its total revenue will continue to grow due to projected overall market growth for 2005 to 2008. In recent years, the companys growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenue due to sales price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets. In the laser printer market, this pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers to add higher profit margin optional features including network adapters, document management software, additional memory, paper handling and multifunction capabilities. Pricing pressure is also partially offset by the opportunity to provide business solutions and services to customers who are increasingly looking for assistance to better manage and leverage their document related costs and output infrastructure. In the inkjet product market, advances in inkjet technology have resulted in products with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices. Additionally, the number of consumers seeking to print digitally captured images in their homes has driven significant growth in the photo printer and all in one products. The greater affordability of inkjet printers, improvements in photo printing products, as well as the growth in the all in one category, have been important factors in the growth of this market. As the installed base of Lexmark laser printers, inkjet printers and multifunction devices continues to grow, management expects the market for supplies will grow as well, as such supplies are routinely required for use throughout the life of those products. While profit margins on printers and multifunction products have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure, the supplies are a higher margin, recurring business, which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time. The companys dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for IBM branded printers, aftermarket supplies for certain competitors products and typewriter supplies that require little ongoing investment. The company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline, and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Lexmarks discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 18 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, copyright fees, product royalty obligations, restructurings, pension and other postretirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. REVENUE RECOGNITION The company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale. The company also provides price protection to substantially all of its reseller customers. The company records reductions to revenue for the estimated impact of price protection when price reductions to resellers are anticipated. If market conditions were to decline, the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due, the financial health of customers, unusual macroeconomic conditions and historical experience. If the financial condition of the companys customers deteriorates or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments, the company records additional allowances as needed. WARRANTY RESERVES The company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The reserve for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty, estimated product failure rates, and material usage and service delivery costs. The estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results. To minimize warranty costs, the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the companys estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required. INVENTORY RESERVES AND ADVERSE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS The company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. The company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements, product life cycle, product pricing 19 and quality issues. Also, the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required. LONG LIVED ASSETS Management considers the potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset impairment review estimates the fair value of an asset based upon the future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. Such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset, expected periods that an asset may be utilized and appropriate discount rates. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The companys pension and non pension postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts. Examples of assumptions the company must make include selecting the following: expected long term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate that reflects the rate at which pension benefits could be settled and the anticipated rates of future compensation increases. The company uses long term historical actual asset return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop its expected return on plan assets. This assumption is reviewed and set annually at the beginning of each year. Differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the calculation of net periodic cost (benefit) over five years. The deferred amounts resulting from this averaging process are not expected to have a significant effect on the companys results of operations for 2005. The discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments at December 31 each year. The rate of future compensation increases is determined by the company based upon its long term plans for such increases. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future service period of the plan participants. For 2004, a 25 basis point change in the assumptions for asset return, discount rate and compensation increases, would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost. Changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the companys stockholders equity. Actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect, in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate, may result in a plans assets being less than a plans accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO"). The ABO is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based upon past compensation levels. The company is required to show in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position a net liability that is at least equal to the ABO less the market value of plan assets. This liability is referred to as an additional minimum liability ("AML"). An AML, which is recorded and updated on December 31 each year, is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in other comprehensive earnings (loss) in the equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (on a net of tax basis) and or as an intangible asset to the degree the company has unrecognized prior service costs. INCOME TAXES The company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates. These estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities 20 resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets. If the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate, if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably, the company could potentially experience significant losses in excess of the reserves established. Likewise, if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed, if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably, the company could potentially experience significant gains. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES Although the company had substantially completed all restructuring activities at December 31, 2002, and the employees had exited the business, approximately $4.7 million of severance payments were made during 2003. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the companys restructuring activities. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The following table summarizes the results of Lexmarks operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) DOLLARS % OF REV DOLLARS % OF REV DOLLARS % OF REV Revenue.............. $5,313.8 100.0% $4,754.7 100.0% $4,356.4 100.0% Gross profit......... 1,791.4 33.7% 1,545.1 32.5% 1,370.6 31.5% Operating expense.... 1,059.3 19.9% 951.2 20.0% 859.8 19.7% Operating income..... 732.1 13.8% 593.9 12.5% 510.8 11.7% Net earnings......... 568.7 10.7% 439.2 9.2% 366.7 8.4% REVENUE Consolidated revenue increased 12% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 9% in 2003 compared to 2002. During fiscal 2004, one customer, Dell, accounted for $570 million, or 10.7 percent of the companys total revenue. Sales to Dell are included in both the business and consumer market segments. In 2003 and 2002, no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of total revenue. The following tables provide a breakdown of the companys revenue by market segment, geography and product category. Revenue by market segment: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 % CHANGE 2003 2002 % CHANGE Business................ $2,816.6 $2,626.9 7% $2,626.9 $2,385.5 10% Consumer................ 2,497.2 2,127.6 17% 2,127.6 1,969.0 8% All other............... 0.2 n/a 0.2 1.9 n/a Total revenue........... $5,313.8 $4,754.7 12% $4,754.7 $4,356.4 9% 21 During 2004, revenue in the business market segment increased $190 million or 7% over 2003. This growth was principally due to increases in unit volumes. The company experienced strong double digit unit growth in the business market segment, but saw significant hardware price declines and continuing mix shift to low end products, resulting in revenue growth less than unit growth. Market demand for low end monochrome laser and color laser printers was strong. During 2003, revenue increased $242 million or 10% when compared to 2002 principally due to increases in unit volumes. During 2004, revenue in the consumer market segment increased $370 million or 17% over 2003. This growth was also due to double digit unit growth, principally driven by strong sales of inkjet all in one products. During 2003, revenue increased $159 million or 8% when compared to 2002 and was principally due to increases in unit volumes. Revenue by geography: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 % CHANGE 2003 2002 % CHANGE United States..................... $2,397.8 $2,169.0 11% $2,169.0 $2,054.5 6% Europe............................ 1,926.3 1,675.9 15% 1,675.9 1,445.2 16% Other International............... 989.7 909.8 9% 909.8 856.7 6% Total revenue..................... $5,313.8 $4,754.7 12% $4,754.7 $4,356.4 9% During 2004, revenue increased in all geographies when compared to 2003 principally due to the previously discussed unit growth. Revenue in Europe and Other International geographies was also favorably impacted by currency. During 2003, revenue increased in all geographies when compared to 2002 due to unit growth. Revenue by product: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 % CHANGE 2003 2002 % CHANGE Laser and inkjet printers......... $2,000.1 $1,759.8 14% $1,759.8 $1,631.1 8% Laser and inkjet supplies......... 2,974.8 2,629.4 13% 2,629.4 2,334.5 13% Other............................. 338.9 365.5 (7)% 365.5 390.8 (6)% Total revenue..................... $5,313.8 $4,754.7 12% $4,754.7 $4,356.4 9% During 2004 and 2003, laser and inkjet printers and laser and inkjet supplies revenue both increased when compared to the prior year. These increases reflected solid unit growth in both the business and consumer market segments as discussed above. GROSS PROFIT The following table provides gross profit information: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 % CHANGE 2003 2002 % CHANGE GROSS PROFIT: Dollars........................... $1,791.4 $1,545.1 16% $1,545.1 $1,370.6 13% % of Revenue...................... 33.7% 32.5% 1.2pts 32.5% 31.5% 1.0pts During 2004, consolidated gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased when compared to the prior year. The improvement in the gross profit margin over 2003 was principally due to improved product margins (1.9 percentage points) which was mostly printer driven, partially offset by a negative mix among products toward hardware (0.7 percentage points). 22 During 2003, the increase in consolidated gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue was attributable to improved supplies margins (1.8 percentage points) and an increased mix of supplies (0.9 percentage points), partially offset by lower printer margins (2.0 percentage points). OPERATING EXPENSE The following table presents information regarding the companys operating expenses during the periods indicated: 2004 2003 2002 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) DOLLARS % OF REV DOLLARS % OF REV DOLLARS % OF REV OPERATING EXPENSE: Research and development.... $ 312.7 5.9% $ 265.7 5.6% $ 247.9 5.7% Selling, general & administrative........... 746.6 14.0% 685.5 14.4% 617.8 14.1% Restructuring and related reversal................. (5.9) (0.1)% Total operating expense..... $1,059.3 19.9% $ 951.2 20.0% $ 859.8 19.7% During 2004, operating expense increased $108 million or 11% compared to 2003. The company has accelerated its investment in research and development to support new product initiatives and to advance current technologies and expects this to continue. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the company launched an advertising campaign to build brand image and awareness. The slight decrease in operating expense as a percent of revenue was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster rate than selling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by higher research and development spending. During 2003, operating expense increased $91 million or 11% compared to 2002. Operating expense in 2002 included a $6 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2002 from the reversal of previously accrued restructuring charges. The 0.3 percentage point increase in operating expense as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the restructuring reserve reversal in 2002. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) The following table provides operating income by market segment: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 % CHANGE 2003 2002 % CHANGE OPERATING INCOME (LOSS): Business..................... $ 752.2 $ 682.1 10% $ 682.1 $ 550.4 24% Consumer..................... 333.2 225.0 48% 225.0 253.2 (11)% Other........................ (353.3) (313.2) (13)% (313.2) (292.8) (7)% Total operating income (loss).................... $ 732.1 $ 593.9 23% $ 593.9 $ 510.8 16% For 2004, the increase in the consolidated operating income was due to a $246 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $108 million increase in operating expense. Operating income for the business market segment increased $70 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating income for the consumer market segment increased $108 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The increases in operating income for both the business and consumer markets were due to higher revenue and improvements in product margins. For 2003, the increase in the consolidated operating income was due to a $174 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $91 million increase in operating expense. Operating income for the business market segment increased $132 million in 2003 compared to 2002, principally due 23 to increased supplies sales. Operating income for the consumer market segment decreased $28 million in 2003, primarily due to lower printer margins. NON OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Non operating income increased $15 million from 2003 to 2004, principally due to additional interest income in 2004 as a result of an increased level of cash and marketable securities held by the company. Non operating expenses declined $15 million from 2002 to 2003, principally due to additional interest income in 2003 as a result of the companys strong cash generation and the $5 million write down of a private equity investment during 2002. NET EARNINGS Net earnings were $569 million in 2004 compared to $439 million in 2003. The increase in net earnings was due to improved operating income, increased non operating income and a lower effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate was 23.8% in 2004 compared to 26.0% in 2003. During 2004, the IRS completed its examination of the companys income tax returns for all years through 2001. As a result of the completion of those audits, the company reversed previously accrued taxes, reducing the income tax provision by $20 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, the companys effective income tax rate was 26.5% for 2004. Net earnings were $439 million in 2003 compared to $367 million in 2002. The increase in net earnings was primarily due to improved operating income and lower non operating expenses. The effective income tax rate remained at 26.0% in 2003 and 2002. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic net earnings per share were $4.38 for 2004 compared to $3.43 in 2003. Diluted net earnings per share were $4.28 for 2004 compared to $3.34 in 2003. Both basic and diluted net earnings per share for 2004 include a $0.15 benefit associated with the previously mentioned tax settlement. Excluding this tax benefit, the increases in basic and diluted net earnings per share were primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings. Basic net earnings per share were $3.43 for 2003 compared to $2.85 in 2002. Diluted net earnings per share were $3.34 for 2003 compared to $2.79 in 2002. The increases in basic and diluted net earnings per share were primarily due to the increase in net earnings. RETIREMENT RELATED BENEFITS The following table provides the total pre tax cost (income) related to Lexmarks retirement plans for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002. Cost (income) amounts are included as an addition to/reduction from, respectively, the companys cost and expense amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 2002 Total cost of retirement related plans...................... $27.5 $31.1 $15.5 Comprised of: Defined benefit plans..................................... $ 9.5 $15.8 $(0.2) Defined contribution plans................................ 12.8 12.8 11.4 Non pension postretirement benefits....................... 5.2 2.5 4.3 24 The company reduced its expected long term asset return assumption on the U.S. plan from 10.0% to 8.5% at the beginning of 2003. This change, and the recognition of losses related to negative pension asset returns, increased the cost of defined benefit plans in 2003. At the beginning of 2004, the company further reduced its expected long term asset return assumption on its U.S. plan from 8.5% to 8.0%. The resulting increase in expense in the U.S. was offset by decreases in non U.S. pension expense due to plan changes. The company reduced its discount rate assumption in the U.S. from 7.5% to 6.5% at the end of 2002, from 6.5% to 6.3% at the end of 2003, and from 6.3% to 5.8% at the end of 2004. These changes, combined with other changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the assumed rate of compensation increase, did not have a significant impact on the companys results of operations for 2004, nor are they expected to have a material effect in 2005. Future effects of retirement related benefits, including the changes noted above, on the operating results of the company depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates and investment performance. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the companys pension and postretirement plans. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FINANCIAL POSITION Lexmarks financial position remains strong at December 31, 2004, with working capital of $1,533 million compared to $1,261 million December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the company had outstanding $1.5 million of short term debt and $149.5 million of long term debt. The debt to total capital ratio was 7% at December 31, 2004, compared to 8% at December 31, 2003. The company had no amounts outstanding under its U.S. trade receivables financing program or its revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. LIQUIDITY The following table summarizes the results of the companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: (IN MILLIONS) 2004 2003 2002 Net cash flow provided by (used for): Operating activities................................... $ 775.4 $ 747.6 $ 815.6 Investing activities................................... (688.1) (543.9) (113.8) Financing activities................................... (209.4) 36.0 (301.8) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash................ 3.7 7.2 7.0 Net (decrease) increase in cash & cash equivalents....................................... $(118.4) $ 246.9 $ 407.0 The companys primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations, which totaled $775 million, $748 million and $816 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash from operations generally has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of approximately $281 million, $5 million and $331 million of its Class A common stock during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Management believes that cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating and capital needs. However, in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient, the company has other potential sources of cash through utilization of its accounts receivable financing program, revolving credit facility or other financing sources. 25 Operating activities: The increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to increased earnings and favorable cash flow changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by unfavorable cash flow changes in trade receivables, other assets and liabilities and deferred taxes. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to unfavorable cash flow changes in accrued liabilities, trade receivables and inventories, offset somewhat by favorable cash flow changes in accounts payable and other assets and liabilities as well as increased earnings. Cash flows from operations were reduced during 2004, 2003 and 2002 by $53 million, $115 million and $57 million, respectively, due to contributions to its pension plans. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the pension plans. Investing activities: The company began investing in marketable securities during the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in a net use of cash of $490 million and $452 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company spent $198 million, $94 million and $112 million on capital expenditures during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The capital expenditures for 2004 principally related to infrastructure support, new product development and manufacturing capacity expansion. Financing activities: The fluctuations in the net cash flows from financing activities were principally due to treasury stock activity. The company has repurchased $281 million, $5 million and $331 million of treasury stock during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. CREDIT FACILITY Effective May 29, 2002, the company entered into a $500 million unsecured, revolving credit facility with a group of banks, including a $200 million 364 day portion and a $300 million 3 year portion. Upon entering into the credit agreement, the company terminated the prior $300 million unsecured, revolving credit facility that was due to expire on January 27, 2003. There were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination. Under the credit facility, the company may borrow in dollars, euros and certain other currencies. The interest rate ranges from 0.35% to 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, the Eurocurrency Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") for borrowings denominated in euros, or other relevant international interest rate for borrowings denominated in another currency. The interest rate spread is based upon the companys debt ratings. In addition, the company is required to pay a facility fee on the $500 million line of credit of 0.075% to 0.25% based upon the companys debt ratings. The interest and facility fees are payable quarterly. The credit agreement contains customary default provisions, leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions. The 364 day portion of the $500 million credit facility had a maturity date of May 28, 2003. During May 2003, each lender approved the extension of the $200 million 364 day portion of the revolving credit facility with a new maturity date of May 26, 2004. The company did not renew the $200 million 364 day portion of the revolving credit facility in 2004. The 3 year portion of the credit facility has a maturity date of May 29, 2005. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. 26 Effective January 20, 2005, the company entered into a $300 million 5 year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Upon entering into the new credit agreement, the company terminated the prior $300 million unsecured, revolving credit facility that was due to expire on May 29, 2005. There were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination. Under the new credit facility, the company may borrow in dollars, euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Under certain circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the new facility may be increased to a maximum of $500 million. Interest on all borrowings under the new facility depends upon the type of loan, namely alternative base rate loans, swingline loans or eurocurrency loans. Alternative base rate loans bear interest at the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent. Swingline loans (limited to $50 million) bear interest at an agreed upon rate at the time of the borrowing. Eurocurrency loans bear interest at the sum of (i) a LIBOR rate for the applicable currency and interest period and (ii) an interest rate spread based upon the companys debt ratings ranging from 0.18% to 0.80%. In addition, the company is required to pay a facility fee on the $300 million line of credit of 0.07% to 0.20% based upon the companys debt ratings. The interest and facility fees are payable at least quarterly. The new credit agreement contains usual and customary default provisions, leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions. The $300 million new credit facility has a maturity date of January 20, 2010. LONG TERM DEBT The company has outstanding $150 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due May 15, 2008, which was initially priced at 98.998%, to yield 6.89% to maturity. The senior notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets. There are no sinking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the company, at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement, as supplemented and amended, in whole or in part. A balance of $149.5 million (net of unamortized discount of $0.5 million) was outstanding at December 31, 2004. During October 2003, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert its $150 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. Interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150 million were executed whereby the company will receive interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% and pay interest at a variable rate of approximately 2.76% above the six month LIBOR. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of May 15, 2008, which is equivalent to the maturity date of the senior notes. OTHER INFORMATION The company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements. The company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility and public debt. However, a downgrade in the companys credit rating could adversely affect the companys ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities. In February 2001, the company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to register $200 million of debt securities. Due to the companys strong cash position, in early 2004 the company determined that it did not plan to utilize the shelf registration, and on January 28, 2004, withdrew its registration pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 27 CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2004: LESS MORE THAN 1 3 3 5 THAN 5 (IN MILLIONS) TOTAL 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS Long term debt..................................... $150 $ $ $150 $ Short term borrowings.............................. 1 1 Capital leases..................................... 9 3 5 1 Operating leases................................... 157 40 63 39 15 Purchase obligations............................... 432 427 4 1 Total contractual obligations...................... $749 $471 $72 $191 $15 Purchase obligations reported in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. U.S. TRADE RECEIVABLES FACILITY In October 2001, the company entered into an agreement to sell its U.S. trade receivables on a limited recourse basis that allowed for a maximum amount of financing availability of $225 million. In October 2003, the agreement was amended and the maximum amount of U.S. trade receivables to be sold was decreased to $200 million. In October 2004, the company entered into an amended and restated agreement to sell its U.S. trade receivables on a limited recourse basis. The amended agreement allows for a maximum financing availability of $200 million under this facility. The primary purpose of the amendment was to extend the term of the facility to October 16, 2007, with required annual renewal of commitments in October 2005 and 2006. This facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold. As collections reduce previously sold receivables, the company may replenish these with new receivables. The company bears a limited risk of bad debt losses on U.S. trade receivables sold, since the company over collateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible receivables. The company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables sold may not include amounts over 90 days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer. The facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which, if triggered, could adversely affect the companys liquidity and or its ability to sell trade receivables. A downgrade in the companys credit rating could reduce the companys ability to sell trade receivables. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the facility had no U.S. trade receivables sold and outstanding. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, the company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships. STOCK REPURCHASE In October 2004, the company received authorization from the board of directors to repurchase an additional $1.0 billion of its Class A common stock for a total repurchase authority of 28 $2.4 billion. At December 31, 2004, there was approximately $0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. This repurchase authority allows the company, at managements discretion, to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors. During 2004, the company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of approximately $281 million. As of December 31, 2004, since the inception of the program, the company had repurchased approximately 38.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.5 billion. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures totaled $198 million, $94 million and $112 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The capital expenditures were primarily attributable to infrastructure support and new product development during 2004, 2003 and 2002. During 2005, the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million, primarily attributable to infrastructure support including capacity expansion, and new product development. The capital expenditures are expected to be funded through cash from operations. EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND EXCHANGE RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Revenue derived from international sales, including exports from the United States, make up about half of the companys consolidated revenue, with Europe accounting for approximately two thirds of international sales. Substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies. Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Certain of the companys Latin American entities use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Lexmarks operations in Argentina were adversely impacted by currency devaluation during the first six months of 2002. This resulted in translation losses of approximately $5 million in 2002. Since June 2002, the company did not experience significant translation losses related to the Argentina operations. Currency translation has significantly affected international revenue and cost of revenue, but it did not have a material impact on operating income during 2002. The 2003 and 2004 operating income was materially positively affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The company acts to neutralize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges, such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions. The companys exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges. Therefore, the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities, which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management. TAX MATTERS The companys effective income tax rate was approximately 23.8%, 26.0% and 26.0% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The current years effective income tax rate was impacted favorably by the companys resolution with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") discussed in the next paragraph. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, the companys effective income tax rate was 26.5% for 2004. Due to the anticipated geographical mix of earnings for 2005, the company expects the 2005 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.0%. During 2004, the IRS completed its examination of the companys income tax returns for all years through 2001. As a result of the completion of those audits, the company reversed previously accrued taxes, reducing the income tax provision by $20 million, or $0.15 per share, in the third quarter of 2004. The IRS has now started its examination of tax years 2002 and 2003. The 29 company and its subsidiaries are also subject to tax examinations in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The company believes that adequate amounts have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations. As of December 31, 2004, the company had non U.S. tax loss carryforwards of $10.4 million, which have an indefinite carryforward period. On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act"). The Jobs Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and as of today, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Jobs Act. The company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Based on the companys analysis to date, it is possible that the company could repatriate as much as $684 million. If that full amount is repatriated in 2005, the estimated income tax effect of that repatriation would be approximately $70 million, based on the information available and the law in effect on December 31, 2004. The company expects to conclude its analysis of this repatriation incentive during 2005. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (revised December 2003), which replaces FIN 46. FIN 46 R incorporates certain modifications to FIN 46 adopted by the FASB subsequent to the issuance of FIN 46, including modifications to the scope of FIN 46. Additionally, FIN 46 R also incorporates much of the guidance previously issued in the form of FASB Staff Positions. For all special purpose entities ("SPEs") created prior to February 1, 2003, public entities must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early adopt the provisions of FIN 46 R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. The company has evaluated the provisions of this interpretation and determined that the interpretation has no impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 106 2 ("FSP 106 2"), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of post retirement health care benefit plans ("plan sponsors") that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FSP 106 2 superceded FSP 106 1, which was issued in January 2004, and permitted plan sponsors of a post retirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Act until more authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy was issued. The company had elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act under FSP 106 1. FSP 106 2 was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. On January 21, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released final regulations implementing major provisions of the Act. The company evaluated the provisions of FSP 106 2 and the new regulations and determined that they did not have a material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 30 In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that ". . . under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. . . .". This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. The guidance in APB 29 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS 153 are applicable for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which replaces SFAS 123 and supercedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The company will be required to adopt SFAS 123R at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 and is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R, including selection of the transition method. SFAS 123R allows for prospective and retroactive transition alternatives. The prospective alternative requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock based awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive alternatives require that compensation expense for all unvested awards be recognized beginning with the first period restated. The retroactive alternatives allow for the restatement of prior periods either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The company expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on its results of operations and earnings per share. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S. Based Manufacturers by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("FSP 109 1"). FSP 109 1 clarifies that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The FSP, issued on December 21, 2004, went into effect upon being issued. In December 2004, the FASB also issued FSP 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("FSP 109 2"). FSP 109 2 provides enterprises more time (beyond the financial reporting period during which the American Jobs Creation Act took effect) to evaluate the impact on the enterprises plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109. The FSP, issued on December 21, 2004, went into effect upon being issued. 31 The company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. The company expects to conclude its analysis of this repatriation incentive during 2005. INFLATION The company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures. As a result, future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the companys business. In an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases, the company must continually manage its product costs and manufacturing processes. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are made based upon managements current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management, and there are a number of factors that could adversely affect the companys future operating results or cause the companys actual results to differ materially from the estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements, including without limitation, the factors set forth below: The companys future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop, manufacture and market products that are reliable, competitive, and meet customers needs. The markets for laser and inkjet products and associated supplies are aggressively competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality. The impact of competitive activities on the sales volumes or revenue of the company, or the companys inability to effectively deal with these competitive issues, could have a material adverse effect on the companys ability to maintain or grow retail shelf space or market share and on its financial results. The company and its major competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and or technological resources than the company, have regularly lowered prices on their products and are expected to continue to do so. In particular, both the inkjet and laser printer markets have experienced and are expected to continue to experience significant price pressure. Price reductions on inkjet or laser products or the inability to reduce costs, including warranty costs, contain expenses or increase or maintain sales as currently expected, as well as price protection measures or a shift in the mix of products sold, could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the companys ability to grow or maintain its market share. The introduction of products by the company or its competitors, or delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs, any disruption in the supply of new or existing products due to quality issues, the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs, the life cycles of the companys products, as well as delays in product development and manufacturing, and variations in the cost of component parts, may impact sales, may cause a buildup in the companys inventories, make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the companys future operating results. The competitive pressure to develop technology and products and to increase marketing expenditures also could cause significant changes in the level of the companys operating expenses. 32 The companys performance depends in part upon its ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels of the company and its resellers. Unexpected fluctuations in reseller inventory levels could disrupt ordering patterns and may adversely affect the companys financial results. In addition, the financial failure or loss of a key customer or reseller could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results. The company must also be able to address production and supply constraints, including product disruptions caused by quality issues, and delays or disruptions in the supply of key components necessary for production, including without limitation component shortages due to increasing global demand in the companys industry and other industries. Such delays, disruptions or shortages may result in lost revenue or in the company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand. The companys future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis. The company markets and sells its products through several sales channels. The company has also advanced a strategy of forming alliances and OEM arrangements with many companies. The companys future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between or among its various sales channels, the loss of any alliance or OEM arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space. Aggressive pricing on laser and inkjet products and or associated supplies from customers and resellers, including, without limitation, OEM customers, could result in a material adverse impact on the companys strategy and financial results. Unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the companys future operating results. The company continues to experience some weak markets for its products, and although the company has seen some market improvement, continued softness in certain markets and uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in lower demand for the companys products. Weakness in demand has resulted in intense price competition and may result in excessive inventory for the company and or its reseller channel, which may adversely affect sales, pricing, risk of obsolescence and or other elements of the companys operating results. Revenue derived from international sales make up about half of the companys revenue. Accordingly, the companys future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, trade protection measures and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. In addition, changes in tax laws and the ability to repatriate cash accumulated outside the U.S. in a tax efficient manner may adversely affect the companys financial results, investment flexibility and operations. Moreover, margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales, and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the U.S. and European markets, in part, because of the higher investment levels for marketing, selling and distribution required to enter these markets. Factors unrelated to the companys operating performance, including the financial failure or loss of significant customers, resellers, manufacturing partners or suppliers; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings; and the ability to retain and attract key personnel, could also adversely affect the companys operating results. In addition, the companys stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Trading activity in the companys common stock, particularly the trading of large blocks and intraday trading in the companys common stock, may affect the companys common stock price. The company relies in large part on its international production facilities and international manufacturing partners, many of which are located in China, for the manufacture of its products and key components of its products. Future operating results may be adversely 33 affected by several factors, including, without limitation, if the companys international operations or manufacturing partners are unable to perform or supply products reliably, if there are disruptions in international trade, disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry, if there are difficulties in transitioning such manufacturing activities among the company, its international operations and or its manufacturing partners, or if there arise production and supply constraints which result in additional costs to the company. The financial failure or loss of a key supplier could result in a material adverse impact on the companys financial results. The companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. In addition, the amount of income tax the company pays is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions. A material assessment by a taxing authority or a decision to repatriate foreign cash could adversely affect the companys profitability. Although the company is currently the exclusive supplier of new cartridges for its laser and inkjet products, there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop new compatible cartridges for the companys products. In addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of the companys cartridges are available and compete with the companys supplies business. The company expects competitive refill and remanufacturing activity to increase. Various legal challenges and governmental activities may intensify competition for the companys aftermarket supplies business. The entrance of additional competitors that are focused on printing solutions could further intensify competition in the inkjet and laser printer markets and could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategy and financial results. The companys inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services and other customer services may result in the loss of customers, loss of reputation and or financial consequences that may have a material adverse impact on the companys financial results and strategy. The companys success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents, copyrights and trademarks, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise materially and adversely affect its operating results or business, as could expenses incurred by the company in obtaining intellectual property rights, enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the companys products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Certain countries (primarily in Europe) and or collecting societies representing copyright owners interests have commenced proceedings to impose fees on devices (such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices) alleging the copyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content. Other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices. The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by product and by country. The financial impact on the company, which will depend in large part upon the outcome of local legislative processes, the companys and other industry participants outcome in contesting the fees and the companys ability to mitigate that impact by increasing prices, which ability will depend upon competitive market conditions, remains uncertain. The outcome of the copyright fee issue could adversely affect the companys operating results and business. The company depends on its information technology systems for the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing, sales and support of its products and services. Any 34 failure in such systems, or the systems of a partner or supplier, may adversely affect the companys operating results. Furthermore, because vast quantities of the companys products flow through only a few distribution centers to provide product to various geographic regions, the failure of information technology systems or any other disruption affecting those product distribution centers could have a material adverse impact on the companys ability to deliver product and on the companys financial results. Terrorist attacks and the potential for future terrorist attacks have created many political and economic uncertainties, some of which may affect the companys future operating results. Future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to such attacks, and other acts of war or hostility may affect the companys facilities, employees, suppliers, customers, transportation networks and supply chains, or may affect the company in ways that are not capable of being predicted presently. While the company reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the companys financial condition and results of operations in connection with the preparation of its quarterly and annual reports, the company does not intend to review or revise, in light of future events, any particular forward looking statement contained in this report. The information referred to above should be considered by investors when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this report, in any of the companys public filings or press releases or in any oral statements made by the company or any of its officers or other persons acting on its behalf. The important factors that could affect forward looking statements are subject to change, and the company does not intend to update the foregoing list of certain important factors. By means of this cautionary note, the company intends to avail itself of the safe harbor from liability with respect to forward looking statements that is provided by Section 27A and Section 21E referred to above. 35 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY The market risk inherent in the companys financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. INTEREST RATES At December 31, 2004, the fair value of the companys senior notes was estimated at $163 million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements, taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt. The fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31, 2004, by approximately $13 million. Market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately $2 million at December 31, 2004. The company has interest rate swaps that serve as a fair value hedge of the companys senior notes. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004, was a liability of $0.2 million. Market risk for the interest rate swaps is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately $2 million at December 31, 2004. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES The company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the companys functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. The primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and other Asian and South American currencies. Exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, put options, and call options with maturity dates of less than eighteen months. The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2004, for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $89 million. This loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures. 36
