Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto: OVERVIEW Products and Segments Lexmark makes it easier for businesses and consumers to move information between the digital and paper worlds. Since its inception in 1991, Lexmark has become a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of printing and imaging solutions for offices and homes. Lexmarks products include laser printers, inkjet printers, multifunction devices, and associated supplies, services and solutions. Lexmark also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms by business users and develops, manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products. The company is primarily managed along business and consumer market segments. The laser product market primarily serves business customers. Laser products can be divided into two major categories shared workgroup products and lower priced desktop products. The company sells its laser products primarily through a large account sales and marketing team and increasingly through small and medium business teams. The large accounts sales efforts are focused on customers who fall into six, specific industry groups: finance, services, retail, manufacturing, public sector and health care. The company distributes its laser products primarily through its well established distributor network. The inkjet product market is predominantly a consumer market but also includes business users who may choose inkjet products as a lower priced alternative or supplement to laser products for personal desktop use. For the consumer market, the company distributes its branded inkjet products and supplies primarily through retail outlets worldwide. The company also sells its products through numerous alliances and OEM arrangements. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the companys reportable segments, which is incorporated herein by reference. Operating Results Summary During 2005, the consumer market segment continued to be impacted by aggressive price competition and promotional activities, and softer than expected supplies sales. In the business market segment, the company was impacted by mix changes to low end laser printers and price declines, as well as softer than expected supplies sales. Inkjet and laser hardware average unit revenue (AUR) was down approximately 15% and 20%, respectively. Supplies revenue increased 5% in 2005 compared to the prior year and increased 13% in 2004 compared to the prior year. The company believes the decrease in supplies revenue growth compared to the prior year was due to year to year (YTY) channel inventory changes in both laser and inkjet supplies and due to weakness in end user demand, particularly in the second half of 2005. Management expects to see additional negative YTY impacts in the first quarter of 2006. To improve profitability and the companys cost and expense structure, the company announced two action plans in January 2006: First, the company is implementing a more rigorous process to improve lifetime profitability and payback on inkjet sales. Second, the company announced a restructuring plan to improve its costs and expense structure. The plan includes consolidating supplies manufacturing capacity, reducing costs and expenses in the areas of supply chain, general and administrative expense, as well as marketing and sales support functions and modifying its U.S. retirement plans. Refer to the section entitled RESULTS OF OPERATIONS that follows for a further discussion of the companys results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Trends and Opportunities Lexmark management believes that the total distributed office and home printing output opportunity exceeded $85 billion in 2005, including hardware, supplies and related services. This opportunity includes printers and multifunction devices as well as a declining base of copiers and fax machines that are increasingly being integrated into multifunction devices. Based on industry analyst information, Lexmark management estimates that this market will grow annually at low to mid single digit percentage rates through 2009. Market trends driving long term growth include: Continuing improvement in price/performance points; Continued convergence in technology between printers, scanners, copiers and fax machines into single, integrated AIO devices; Advancements in digital photography driving the opportunity to print digital images on distributed output devices; Increased adoption of color output in business; and Advancements in electronic movement of information, driving more pages to be printed by end users when and where it is convenient to do so. As a result of these market trends, Lexmark has growth opportunities in low end monochrome laser printers, color lasers, laser AIOs, photo AIOs, and business inkjet four in ones. Laser printer unit growth in recent years has generally exceeded the growth rate of laser printer revenue due to unit growth in lower priced desktop color and monochrome laser printers and unit price reductions. Additionally, color and multifunction laser printer units represent a more significant component of laser unit growth. Management believes these trends will continue. This pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers in the shared workgroup laser market to add higher profit margin optional features. Pricing pressure is also partially offset by the opportunity to provide business solutions and services to customers. In the inkjet product market, advances in inkjet technology have resulted in products with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices. Additionally, the number of consumers seeking to print in their homes digitally captured images has driven significant growth in the photo printer and AIO products. Key factors promoting this trend are greater affordability of photo products along with improvements in photo printing, including the print speed, quality and print permanence. Growth in inkjet product revenue in recent years has been slower than unit growth due to price reductions. Management expects these trends to continue. While profit margins on printers and multifunction products have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure, supplies sales are higher margin and recurring, which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time. However, as the hardcopy industry matures and printer and copier markets converge, management expects competitive pressures to negatively impact pricing and industry margins. Management saw evidence of this increasing pressure on industry margins particularly in the second half of 2005. The companys dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for IBM branded printers, aftermarket supplies for certain competitors products and typewriter supplies that require little ongoing investment. The company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline, and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit. 23 Table of Contents Challenges and Risks In recent years, the company and its principal competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and or technological resources than Lexmark, have regularly lowered prices on printers and are expected to continue to do so. Other challenges and risks faced by the company include: New product announcements by the companys principal competitors can have, and in the past, have had, a material adverse effect on the companys financial results. With the convergence of traditional printer and copier markets, major laser competitors now include traditional copier companies. The company must compete with its larger competitors for retail shelf space allocated to printers and their associated supplies. The company sees the possibility of new entrants into the market which could also impact the companys growth and market share. There can be no assurance that other companies will not develop new compatible cartridges for Lexmark products. In addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of the companys cartridges are available and compete with the companys supplies business. The company expects that as it competes with larger competitors, the companys increased market presence may attract more frequent challenges, both legal and commercial, from its competitors, including claims of possible intellectual property infringement. The market for other office imaging products is also highly competitive and the impact printing sector of the supplies market is declining. Refer to the section entitled Competition in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of major uncertainties faced by the industry and company. Additionally, refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of factors that could impact the companys operating results. Strategy and Initiatives Lexmarks strategy is based on a business model of building an installed base of printers and multifunction products that generate demand for its related supplies and services. Management believes that Lexmark has the following strengths related to this business model: Lexmark is exclusively focused on distributed home and office network or desktop computer printing and related solutions; Lexmark internally develops all three of the key technologies in the distributed printing business, including inkjet, monochrome laser and color laser; and Lexmark has leveraged its technological capabilities and its commitment to flexibility and responsiveness to build strong relationships with large account customers and channel partners. Lexmarks strategy involves the following initiatives: Expand the number and the penetration of the product segments in which the company participates. Lexmark is focused on increasing its participation in a number of growth segments such as color laser, laser multifunction products, business inkjet and photo inkjets. Expand the penetration of the market segments in which it participates. Lexmark is driving to expand the companys presence in its enterprise, small and medium business (SMB) and consumer market segments through its solutions efforts and working with channel partners. The company also continues to pursue incremental business through its alliance partners. 24 Table of Contents Continue to develop Lexmarks brand awareness and brand positioning. To drive these improvements, Lexmark launched its Uncomplicate advertising campaign in the fourth quarter of 2004 and has continued this advertising through 2005. In addition to investments in the Lexmark brand, the successful execution of this strategy involves increased investment in product and solution development. The company increased its research and development spending by 18% in 2004 and by 8% in 2005. This investment has led to new products and solutions aimed at targeted growth segments as well as a pipeline of future products. The companys strategy for dot matrix printers and other office imaging products is to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit. Refer to the section entitled Strategy in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of the companys strategies and initiatives. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Lexmarks discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, copyright fees, product royalty obligations, restructurings, pension and other postretirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale. The company also provides price protection to substantially all of its distributor and reseller customers. The amount of price protection is limited based on the amount of dealers and resellers inventory on hand (including in transit inventory) as of the date of the price change. The company records a reserve for price protection as soon as the price change is probable based on estimated dealer and reseller inventories. The company deems a price reduction to be probable if a decision has been made to take an action and the effective date is within 45 days. Additionally, an allowance for price protection for sales between the date the change is probable and the effective date of the price change is recorded at the time of sale. If market conditions were to decline, the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due, the financial health of customers, unusual macroeconomic conditions and historical experience. If the financial 25 Table of Contents condition of the companys customers deteriorates or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments, the company records additional allowances as needed. Warranty Reserves The company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The reserve for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty, estimated product failure rates, and material usage and service delivery costs. The estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results. To minimize warranty costs, the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the companys estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required. Inventory Reserves and Adverse Purchase Commitments The company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. The company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements, product life cycle, product pricing and quality issues. Also, the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required. Long Lived Assets Management considers the potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset impairment review estimates the fair value of an asset based upon the future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. Such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset, expected periods that an asset may be utilized and appropriate discount rates. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans The companys pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts. Significant assumptions the company must make related to its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are: expected long term return on plan assets based on long term historical actual asset return information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources. This assumption is reviewed and set annually at the beginning of each year. discount rate reflects the rates at which pension benefits could effectively be settled and is based on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments. Effective December 31, 2005, the company began using a yield curve approach to reduce the difference in duration between the bond rates used to set the discount rate and the cash flows of the expected future benefit payments. The yield curve approach did not have a material impact on current period operating results and is not expected to have a material impact on future operating results. rate of compensation increase based on the companys long term plans for such increases. Differences between actual and expected asset returns on equity investments are recognized in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost over five years. The deferred amounts resulting from this averaging process are not expected to have a significant effect on the companys results of operations for 2006. 26 Table of Contents Actual results that differ from assumptions that fall outside the 10% corridor, as defined by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future service period of the plan participants. For 2005, a 25 basis point change in the assumptions for asset return, discount rate and compensation increases, would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost. Changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the companys stockholders equity if a plans assets are less than a plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at the measurement date (December 31). The ABO is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based upon past compensation levels. The company is required to show in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position a net liability that is at least equal to the ABO less the market value of plan assets. This liability is referred to as an additional minimum liability (AML). An AML, which is recorded and updated on December 31 each year, is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in other comprehensive earnings (loss) in the equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (on a net of tax basis) and or as an intangible asset to the degree the company has unrecognized prior service costs. Income Taxes The company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates. These estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets. If the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate, if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably, the company could potentially experience significant losses in excess of the reserves established. Likewise, if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed, if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably, the company could potentially experience significant gains. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary Market conditions continued to be challenging during 2005. During 2005, the consumer market segment continued to be impacted by aggressive price competition and promotional activities, and softer than expected supplies sales. In the business market segment, the company was impacted by mix changes to low end monochrome laser printers and price declines, as well as softer than expected supplies sales. Inkjet and laser hardware AUR, which reflects the changes in both pricing and mix, was down approximately 15% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, supplies revenue increased 5% in 2005 compared to the prior year and increased 13% in 2004 compared to the prior year. The company believes the decrease in supplies revenue growth compared to the prior year was due to YTY channel inventory changes in both laser and inkjet supplies and due to weakness in end user demand, particularly in the second half of 2005. Notwithstanding these impacts, management believes that end user demand for laser supplies continues to grow YTY. However, in the inkjet market, management projects an on going decline in growth rate in end user demand for supplies due to weak sales of branded hardware over the last 18 months, the companys announced change in inkjet sales as discussed below, and the slowing growth rate the company is now experiencing in OEM sales. Management expects to see additional negative YTY impacts in the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, management expects supplies revenue to be about flat versus last year. 27 Table of Contents To improve profitability and the companys cost and expense structure, the company announced two action plans in January 2006: First, the company is implementing a more rigorous process to improve lifetime profitability and payback on inkjet sales. A major impact of this change will be a significant reduction in low end single function bundle inkjet sales of both branded and OEM products. This change is expected to result in a higher mix of AIOs, stand alone sales and more profitable sales channels. Second, the company announced a restructuring plan to improve its costs and expense structure. The company will be consolidating manufacturing capacity in its supplies facilities which will include the closure of its Rosyth, Scotland inkjet manufacturing facility. The company will also reduce its costs and expenses in the areas of supply chain, general and administrative expense, as well as marketing and sales support functions. The company also plans to freeze its U.S. pension plan in April 2006, and enhance its corporate 401(k) contribution. In total, the restructuring will eliminate or transfer about 1,350 positions overall, with approximately 825 positions being eliminated, and about 525 positions being transferred to low cost countries. Management projects the costs of implementing these actions to approximate $130 million in 2006, of which approximately $80 million will be cash expense. The restructuring plan is expected to save approximately $50 million in 2006 and $80 million per year thereafter. In addition to the restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2006, the company also expects the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on its results of operations and earnings per share. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The following table summarizes the financial results of Lexmarks operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in Millions) Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Revenue $ 5,221.5 100.0 % $ 5,313.8 100.0 % $ 4,754.7 100.0 % Gross profit 1,635.6 31.3 1,791.4 33.7 1,545.1 32.5 Operating expense 1,101.9 21.1 1,059.3 19.9 951.2 20.0 Operating income 533.7 10.2 732.1 13.8 593.9 12.5 Net earnings 356.3 6.8 568.7 10.7 439.2 9.2 Net earnings in 2005 decreased 37% compared to 2004. The decrease in net earnings was principally due to lower operating income as a result of decreased gross profits of $156 million and increased net tax costs of $52 million resulting from the board approval to repatriate $684 million of foreign dividends during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net earnings for 2005 also included one time termination benefit charges of $10.4 million ($7.7 million after tax) related to the workforce reduction announced in the third quarter of 2005. Net earnings in 2004 included a $20 million tax benefit due to the settlement of all outstanding issues with the Internal Revenue Service on audits for the years 1997 2001. Net earnings in 2004 increased 29% compared to 2003. The increase in net earnings was due to improved operating income, increased non operating income and a lower effective tax rate resulting primarily from the above mentioned $20 million tax benefit in 2004. Revenue Consolidated revenue decreased 2% in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 12% in 2004 compared to 2003. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, one customer, Dell, accounted for $782 million, or 15.0% and $570 million, or 10.7% of the companys total revenue, respectively. Sales to Dell are included in both the business 28 Table of Contents and consumer market segments. In 2003, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. The following tables provide a breakdown of the companys revenue by market segment, product category, unit shipments and revenue by geography: Revenue by market segment: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 % Change 2004 2003 % Change Business $ 2,774.8 $ 2,816.6 (1 )% $ 2,816.6 $ 2,626.9 7 % Consumer 2,446.7 2,497.2 (2 ) 2,497.2 2,127.6 17 All other n/a 0.2 n/a Total revenue $ 5,221.5 $ 5,313.8 (2 )% $ 5,313.8 $ 4,754.7 12 % Revenue by product: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 % Change 2004 2003 % Change Laser and inkjet printers $ 1,799.4 $ 2,000.1 (10 )% $ 2,000.1 $ 1,759.8 14 % Laser and inkjet supplies 3,117.2 2,974.8 5 2,974.8 2,629.4 13 Other 304.9 338.9 (10 ) 338.9 365.5 (7 ) Total revenue $ 5,221.5 $ 5,313.8 (2 )% $ 5,313.8 $ 4,754.7 12 % Unit shipments: (Units in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Laser units 2.0 1.7 1.3 Inkjet units 18.4 18.3 15.2 Business market segment During 2005, revenue in the business market segment decreased $42 million or 1% compared to 2004. This decrease was principally due to decreased hardware revenue attributable to more aggressive pricing and lower than expected supplies revenue growth. During 2005, the company experienced a 15% unit growth in laser unit shipments, but saw significant hardware price declines and a continuing mix shift to low end products. Laser hardware AUR was down approximately 20% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting the impact of pricing and a continuing unfavorable mix shift to low end monochrome lasers. In the fourth quarter of 2005, laser units declined 7% YTY with strong unit growth in color lasers and good unit growth in branded low end monochrome lasers being more than offset by declines in branded workgroup laser and OEM sales. During 2004, revenue in the business market segment increased $190 million or 7% over 2003. This growth was principally due to increases in unit volumes. During 2004, the company experienced a 31% unit growth in the business market segment, but saw significant hardware price declines and continuing mix shift to low end products, resulting in revenue growth less than unit growth. Laser hardware AUR was down approximately 20% in 2004 compared to 2003, reflecting the impact of both pricing and an unfavorable mix shift to low end monochrome lasers. Consumer market segment During 2005, revenue in the consumer market segment decreased $51 million or 2% over prior year. This decrease was principally due to decreased hardware revenue attributable to more aggressive pricing and promotion activities and lower than expected supplies revenue growth. During 2005, the 29 Table of Contents company experienced about flat YTY unit sales and saw significant hardware price declines. Inkjet hardware AUR was down approximately 15% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting the impact of pricing partially offset by a more favorable mix shift to AIOs. In the fourth quarter of 2005, inkjet unit shipments were down 8% YTY as unit growth in branded AIOs including unit growth in the key segment of photo AIOs and inkjet four in ones were more than offset by declines in branded single function printers and OEM unit sales. During 2004, revenue in the consumer market segment increased $370 million or 17% over the prior year. During 2004, this increase was principally due to 21% unit growth, principally driven by inkjet AIO products. Inkjet hardware AUR was down slightly in 2004 compared to 2003. Revenue by geography: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 % Change 2004 2003 % Change United States $ 2,360.5 $ 2,397.8 (2 )% $ 2,397.8 $ 2,169.0 11 % Europe 1,853.8 1,926.3 (4 ) 1,926.3 1,675.9 15 Other International 1,007.2 989.7 2 989.7 909.8 9 Total revenue $ 5,221.5 $ 5,313.8 (2 )% $ 5,313.8 $ 4,754.7 12 % During 2005, revenue decreased in the U.S. and Europe geographies due to the previously mentioned aggressive pricing and promotion activities and softer than expected supplies growth, partially offset by the increase in revenue in the Other International geographies when compared to 2004. Currency did not have a material impact on revenue in Europe and Other International geographies during 2005. During 2004, revenue increased in all geographies when compared to 2003 principally due to the previously discussed unit growth. Revenue in Europe and Other International geographies was favorably impacted by currency in 2004 and 2003 compared to the prior year. Gross Profit The following table provides gross profit information: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 Change 2004 2003 Change Gross profit: Dollars $ 1,635.6 $ 1,791.4 (9)% $ 1,791.4 $ 1,545.1 16% % of revenue 31.3% 33.7% (2.4)pts 33.7% 32.5% 1.2pts During 2005, consolidated gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased when compared to the prior year. The 2.4 percentage point decrease in the gross profit margin from 2004 was principally due to lower product margins of 5.2 percentage points which was mostly printer driven, partially offset by a 2.8 percentage point favorable mix shift among products toward supplies. During 2004, consolidated gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased when compared to the prior year. The 1.2 percentage point improvement in the gross profit margin over 2003 was principally due to improved product margins (1.9 percentage points) which was mostly printer driven, partially offset by a negative mix among products toward hardware (0.7 percentage points). During 2005, the company continued efforts begun in 2002 to execute supplier managed inventory (SMI) agreements with its primary suppliers to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. In instances where a non cancelable commitment is made to purchase product at a cost greater than the expected sales price, the companys accounting policy is to recognize a liability and related expense for future losses. During 2005, several products transitioned to SMI agreements that were not previously under such agreements. The pre tax benefit in 2005 to the company of this transition was approximately $49 million which was reflected as lower adverse purchase commitment charges. The benefits of products transitioning to SMI agreements in 2004 and 2003 were approximately $18 million and 30 Table of Contents $3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the significant majority of major printer suppliers are now under new SMI agreements. As such, the company does not anticipate significant impacts going forward. Any impact on future operations would depend upon factors such as the companys ability to negotiate new SMI agreements, future market pricing and product costs. Operating Expense The following table presents information regarding the companys operating expenses during the periods indicated: 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in Millions) Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Dollars % of Rev Operating expense: Research and development $ 336.4 6.4 % $ 312.7 5.9 % $ 265.7 5.6 % Selling, general & administrative 765.5 14.7 746.6 14.0 685.5 14.4 Total operating expense $ 1,101.9 21.1 % $ 1,059.3 19.9 % $ 951.2 20.0 % During 2005, operating expense increased $43 million or 4% compared to the prior year as the company continued its strategic investments in research and development and increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The company increased its research and development spending by $47 million or 18% in 2004 and by $24 million or 8% in 2005. The company continued its accelerated investment in research and development to support product and solution development and expects this to continue. This investment has led to new products and solutions aimed at targeted growth segments including color laser, laser AIO and business inkjet, as well as a pipeline of future products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the prior year principally due to one time termination benefit charges of $10.4 million related to the workforce reduction announced in the third quarter of 2005. The company also continued during 2005 its Uncomplicate advertising campaign launched in the fourth quarter of 2004 to develop Lexmarks brand awareness and brand positioning. During 2004, operating expense increased $108 million or 11% compared to the prior year. The company has accelerated its investment in research and development to support new product initiatives and to advance current technologies . Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the company launched an advertising campaign to build brand image and awareness. The slight decrease in operating expense as a percent of revenue was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster rate than selling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by higher research and development spending. Operating Income (Loss) The following table provides operating income by market segment: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 Change 2004 2003 Change Operating income (loss): Business $ 661.0 $ 752.2 (12)% $ 752.2 $ 682.1 10% % of segment revenue 23.8% 26.7% (2.9)pts 26.7% 26.0% .7pts Consumer 232.1 333.2 (30)% 333.2 225.0 48% % of segment revenue 9.5% 13.3% (3.8)pts 13.3% 10.6% 2.7pts Other (359.4) (353.3) (2)% (353.3) (313.2) (13)% Total operating income (loss) $ 533.7 $ 732.1 (27)% $ 732.1 $ 593.9 23% % of total revenue 10.2% 13.8% (3.6)pts 13.8% 12.5% 1.3pts 31 Table of Contents For 2005, the decrease in consolidated operating income was primarily due to a $156 million decrease in gross profit attributable to gross profit margin erosion and a $43 million increase in operating expenses as discussed above compared to the prior year. Operating income for the business and consumer market segments decreased $91 million and $101 million, respectively, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower gross profits attributable to lower revenues and lower product margins in each segment. For 2004, the increase in the consolidated operating income was due to a $246 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $108 million increase in operating expense. Operating income for the business and consumer market segments increased $70 million and $108 million, respectively, in 2004 compared to 2003. The increases in operating income for both the business and consumer markets were due to higher revenue and improvements in product margins. Interest and Other (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Interest & other (income) expense Interest (income) expense, net $ (26.5 ) $ (14.5 ) $ (0.4 ) Other expense (income), net 6.5 0.1 0.8 Total interest and other (income) expense, net $ (20.0 ) $ (14.4 ) $ 0.4 Total interest and other (income) expense, net, was income of $20 million in 2005 compared to $14 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to $12 million of additional interest income attributable to higher interest rates in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $4 million in 2005 compared to foreign exchange gains of $2 million in 2004. Total interest and other (income) expense, net, was income of $14 million in 2004 compared to net expense of $0.4 million in 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional income in 2004 as a result of an increased level of cash and marketable securities held by the company. Provision for Income Taxes and Related Matters The companys effective income tax rate was approximately 35.6%, 23.8%, and 26.0% for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The current years effective income tax rate was impacted by two specific events. First, due to the retroactive extension of a favorable, non United States tax rate, the income tax provision was reduced by $3.1 million, or $0.02 per share. Second, on October 22, 2004, the President of the U.S. signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA). The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. On April 28, 2005, the companys board of directors approved a Domestic Reinvestment Plan (DRP) under the AJCA. Pursuant to the DRP, the company repatriated $684 million for which it will claim the 85 percent dividends received deduction provided by the AJCA. The companys 2005 income tax provision includes $51.9 million, or $0.42 per share, to cover the Federal, State, and foreign income taxes the company has estimated it will owe in connection with its repatriation of the $684 million. Excluding the impact of these two events, the effective income tax rate for 2005 would have been 26.8%. During 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of the companys income tax returns for all years through 2001. As a result of the completion of those audits, the company reversed previously accrued taxes, reducing the income tax provision by $20 million, or $0.15 per share, in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, the companys effective income tax rate was 26.5% for 2004. 32 Table of Contents The IRS has started its examination of tax years 2002 and 2003. The IRS has not commenced examinations of tax years 2004 and 2005. The company and its subsidiaries are also subject to tax examinations in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The company believes that adequate amounts have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations. The company is subject to a tax holiday in Switzerland with respect to the earnings of one of the companys wholly owned Swiss subsidiaries. The holiday will expire at the end of 2006. In 2005, the benefit derived from the tax holiday was $11.5 million, or $0.09 per share. In 2004, the benefit derived from the tax holiday was $4.9 million, or $0.04 per share. As of December 31, 2005, the company had non U.S. tax loss carryforwards of $5.9 million, of which $5.5 million have an indefinite carryforward period and $0.4 million has a remaining carryforward period of 4 years. Net Earnings Net earnings in 2005 decreased 37% compared to 2004. The decrease in net earnings was principally due to lower operating income of $198 million as a result of decreased gross profits and increased tax charges as discussed above. Net earnings for 2005 also included one time termination benefit charges of $10.4 million ($7.7 million after tax) related to the workforce reduction announced in the third quarter of 2005. Net earnings in 2004 included a $20 million tax benefit due to the settlement of all outstanding issues with the Internal Revenue Service on audits for the years 1997 2001. Net earnings in 2004 increased 29% compared to 2003. The increase in net earnings was due to improved operating income, increased non operating income and a lower effective tax rate resulting primarily from the above mentioned $20 million tax benefit in 2004. Earnings per Share Basic net earnings per share were $2.94 for 2005 compared to $4.38 in 2004. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.91 for 2005 compared to $4.28 in 2004. Both basic and diluted net earnings per share for 2005 included $0.40 per share net tax cost primarily related to the previously mentioned approval to repatriate foreign dividends partially offset by a benefit from the retroactive extension of a favorable non U.S. tax rate. Additionally, both basic and diluted net earnings per share for 2005 included a $0.06 per share charge for one time termination benefit charges from the previously announced workforce reduction. Excluding these items, the decreases in basic and diluted net earnings per share were primarily attributable to decreased net earnings partially offset by the decrease in the average number of shares outstanding due to the companys stock repurchases. Both basic and diluted net earnings per share for 2004 included a $0.15 benefit associated with the previously mentioned tax settlement. Basic net earnings per share were $4.38 for 2004 compared to $3.43 in 2003. Diluted net earnings per share were $4.28 for 2004 compared to $3.34 in 2003. Both basic and diluted net earnings per share for 2004 include a $0.15 benefit associated with the previously mentioned tax settlement. Excluding this tax benefit, the increases in basic and diluted net earnings per share were primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings. WORKFORCE REDUCTION In order to optimize the companys expense structure, the company approved a plan during the third quarter of 2005 that would reduce its workforce by approximately 275 employees worldwide from various business functions and job classes. A majority of the affected employees exited during the third quarter of 2005 and the separation of the remainder of the affected employees was completed by December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the company incurred one time termination benefit charges of $10.4 million ($7.7 million after tax) related to the plan that is included on the selling, general and administrative line 33 Table of Contents in the operating expense section of the companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Although the workforce reduction was complete at year end 2005, approximately $1.0 million of one time termination benefit payments are remaining to be paid and are reflected in the companys liability balance at December 31, 2005. The following table presents a rollforward of the liability incurred for one time termination benefit charges in connection with the plan. The liability is included on the accrued liabilities line in the companys Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. (Dollars in Millions) Balance at January 1, 2005 $ Costs incurred 10.4 Payments (9.3 ) Other (0.1 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 1.0 As of December 31, 2005, the company incurred one time termination benefit charges of $6.5 million in its Business segment, $2.6 million in its Consumer segment and $1.3 million in its All Other segment. On January 24, 2006, the company announced a restructuring plan to reduce workforce, consolidate some manufacturing capacity, and make certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans. The restructuring plan is expected to save approximately $50 million in 2006 and $80 million per year thereafter. Refer to Note 18, Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS The following table provides the total pre tax cost related to Lexmarks retirement plans for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003. Cost amounts are included as an addition to the companys cost and expense amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Total cost of pension and other postretirement plans $ 43.8 $ 27.5 $ 31.1 Comprised of: Defined benefit plans $ 26.1 $ 9.5 $ 15.8 Defined contribution plans 13.6 12.8 12.8 Other postretirement plans 4.1 5.2 2.5 At the beginning of 2004, the company reduced its expected long term asset return assumption on the U.S. plan from 8.5% to 8.0%. The resulting increase in expense in the U.S. was offset by decreases in the non U.S. pension expense due to plan changes. The increase in the cost of defined benefit plans in 2005 was primarily due to the recognition of previous years investment losses and a curtailment loss due to restructuring in the U.S. The company reduced its discount rate assumption in the U.S. from 6.5% to 6.3% at the end of 2003, from 6.3% to 5.8% at the end of 2004, and from 5.8% to 5.6% at the end of 2005. These changes, combined with other changes in actuarial assumptions, such as the assumed rate of compensation increase, did not have a significant impact on the companys results of operations for 2005, nor are they expected to have a material effect in 2006. On January 24, 2006, the company announced certain changes to its U.S. retirement plans. Refer to Note 18, Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Future effects of retirement related benefits, including the changes noted above, on the operating results of the company depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates and investment performance. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the companys pension and other postretirement plans. 34 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financial Position Lexmarks financial position remains strong at December 31, 2005, with working capital of $936 million compared to $1,533 million at December 31, 2004. The decease in working capital accounts was primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in 2005 resulting principally from the companys stock repurchase activity. At December 31, 2005, the company had $149.6 million of long term debt and no short term debt outstanding. The debt to total capital ratio was 9% at December 31, 2005, compared to 7% at December 31, 2004. The company had no amounts outstanding under its U.S. trade receivables financing program or its revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005. Liquidity The following table summarizes the results of the companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net cash flow provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 576.4 $ 775.4 $ 747.6 Investing activities 4.9 (688.1 ) (543.9 ) Financing activities (1,036.9 ) (209.4 ) 36.0 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2.3 ) 3.7 7.2 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (457.9 ) $ (118.4 ) $ 246.9 The companys primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations, which totaled $576 million, $775 million and $748 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash from operations generally has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion, $0.3 billion and an immaterial amount of its Class A common stock during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Management believes that cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating and capital needs. However, in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient, the company has other potential sources of cash through utilization of its accounts receivable financing program, revolving credit facility or other financing sources. Operating activities The decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to decreased earnings. The cash flow changes in working capital accounts were principally due to the companys continued focus on cash cycle management and timing of payments. Trade receivables decreased from 2004 amounts as December 2005 sales were lower than the prior year. The companys days of sales outstanding were 39 days at December 31, 2005, up slightly from 38 days at December 31, 2004. The days of sales outstanding is calculated on a 90 day moving average based on gross accounts receivable and is adjusted for certain accounts receivable items which have no corresponding revenue, such as value added taxes. Inventory levels decreased from the prior year due to the companys continued focus on inventory management. The companys days of inventory decreased from 47 days at December 31, 2004, to 44 days at December 31, 2005. The days of inventory is calculated on a 90 day moving average based on annualized cost of goods sold. Accounts payable decreased from the prior year primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers. The changes noted in the accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities line items in the current year were primarily attributable to decreases in the companys derivative liabilities from the prior year (refer to Note 14, Derivatives, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details), decreases in compensation accruals and changes in various income tax related accounts. 35 Table of Contents The increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by a net unfavorable change in various asset and liability accounts. Trade receivables increased from 2003 amounts as December 2004 sales were higher than the prior year and an increase in the companys days of sales outstanding from the prior year. The companys days of sales outstanding were 38 days at December 31, 2004, up from 36 days at December 31, 2003. The days of sales outstanding is calculated as discussed above. Inventory levels increased from the prior year as the companys days of inventory increased from 46 days at December 31, 2003, to 47 days at December 31, 2004. Accounts payable increased from the prior year primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers. The company also experienced favorable changes in accrued liabilities and unfavorable changes in other assets and liabilities and deferred taxes. Cash flows from operations were reduced during 2005, 2004 and 2003 by $3 million, $53 million and $115 million, respectively, due to contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the company pension and other postretirement plans. Investing activities The company began investing in marketable securities during the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in a net use of cash of $490 million and $452 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company decreased its marketable securities investments in 2005 by $220 million due to its share repurchase program activity. Refer to the section, Stock Repurchase, which follows for further discussion of the companys stock repurchase program during 2005. The company spent $201 million, $198 million and $94 million on capital expenditures during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The capital expenditures for 2005 related to infrastructure support, manufacturing capacity expansion and new product development. Financing activities The fluctuations in the net cash flows from financing activities were principally due to the companys share repurchase activity. The company repurchased $1.1 billion, $281 million and $5 million of treasury stock during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Credit Facility Effective January 20, 2005, the company entered into a $300 million 5 year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Upon entering into the new credit agreement, the company terminated the prior $300 million unsecured, revolving credit facility that was due to expire on May 29, 2005. There were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination. Under the new credit facility, the company may borrow in dollars, euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Under certain circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the new facility may be increased to a maximum of $500 million. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under the companys credit facilities. Interest on all borrowings under the new facility depends upon the type of loan, namely alternative base rate loans, swingline loans or eurocurrency loans. Alternative base rate loans bear interest at the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent. Swingline loans (limited to $50 million) bear interest at an agreed upon rate at the time of the borrowing. Eurocurrency loans bear interest at the sum of (i) a LIBOR rate for the applicable currency and interest period and (ii) an interest rate spread based upon the companys debt ratings ranging from 0.18% to 0.80%. In addition, the company is required to pay a facility fee on the $300 million line of credit of 0.07% to 0.20% based upon the companys debt ratings. The interest and facility fees are payable at least quarterly. 36 Table of Contents The new credit agreement contains usual and customary default provisions, leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions. The $300 million new credit facility has a maturity date of January 20, 2010. Long term Debt The company has outstanding $150.0 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due May 15, 2008, which was initially priced at 98.998%, to yield 6.89% to maturity. A balance of $149.6 million (net of unamortized discount of $0.4 million) was outstanding at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2004, the balance was $149.5 million (net of unamortized discount of $0.5 million). The senior notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets. There are no sinking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the company, at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement, as supplemented and amended, in whole or in part. During October 2003, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert its $150.0 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. Interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150.0 million were executed whereby the company will receive interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% and pay interest at a variable rate of approximately 2.76% above the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of May 15, 2008, which is equivalent to the maturity date of the senior notes. Other Information The company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements. The company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility and public debt. However, a downgrade in the companys credit rating could adversely affect the companys ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2005: Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (Dollars in Millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 150 $ $ 150 $ $ Short term borrowings Capital leases 9 4 5 Operating leases 134 37 54 28 15 Purchase obligations 278 278 Total contractual obligations $ 571 $ 319 $ 209 $ 28 $ 15 Purchase obligations reported in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Trade Receivables Facility In October 2004, the company entered into an amended and restated agreement to sell a portion of its trade receivables on a limited recourse basis. The amended agreement allows for a maximum capital availability of $200 million under this facility. The primary purpose of the amendment was to extend the term of the facility to October 16, 2007, with required annual renewal of commitments in October 2005 and 2006. In October 2005, the facility was renewed until October 6, 2006. 37 Table of Contents This facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold. As collections reduce previously sold receivables, the company may replenish these with new receivables. The company bears a limited risk of bad debt losses on the trade receivables sold, since the company overcollateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible receivables. The company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables sold to the unrelated third party may not include amounts over 90 days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer. The facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which, if triggered, could adversely affect the companys liquidity and or its ability to sell trade receivables. A downgrade in the companys credit rating could reduce the companys ability to sell trade receivables. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no trade receivables outstanding under the facility. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements. The company maintains a facility whereby it may sell trade receivables to an unrelated third party as discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Repurchase In July 2005, the company received authorization from the board of directors to repurchase an additional $500 million of its Class A common stock for a total repurchase authority of $2.9 billion. At December 31, 2005, there was approximately $0.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. On January 20, 2006, the company received authorization from the board of directors to repurchase an additional $1.0 billion of its Class A common stock for a total repurchase authority of $3.9 billion. As of January 20, 2006, there was approximately $1.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. This repurchase authority allows the company, at managements discretion, to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors. During 2005, the company repurchased approximately 17.0 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2005, since the inception of the program in April 1996, the company had repurchased approximately 55.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2005, the company had reissued 0.5 million shares of previously repurchased shares in connection with certain of its employee benefit programs. As a result of these issuances as well as the retirement of 44 million shares of treasury stock mentioned below, the net treasury shares outstanding at December 31, 2005, were 10.5 million. On December 20, 2005, the company received authorization from the board of directors and retired 44 million shares of the companys Class A common stock currently held in the companys treasury as treasury stock. The retired shares resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Earnings for the effects on common stock, capital in excess of par, retained earnings and treasury stock from the retirement of the 44 million shares of Class A common stock. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures totaled $201 million, $198 million and $94 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The capital expenditures for 2005 related to infrastructure support, manufacturing capacity, and new product development. During 2006, the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $230 million, primarily attributable to infrastructure support, manufacturing capacity expansion and new product development. The capital expenditures are expected to be funded through cash from operations. 38 Table of Contents EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND EXCHANGE RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Revenue derived from international sales, including exports from the U.S., accounts for approximately 55% of the companys consolidated revenue, with Europe accounting for approximately two thirds of international sales. Substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies. Consequently, period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Certain of the companys Latin American entities use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Currency translation has had less of an impact on international revenue in recent years. Currency translation did not have a material impact on 2005 operating income, while the 2004 and 2003 operating income was materially positively affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The company acts to neutralize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges, such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions. The companys exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges. Therefore, the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities, which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in Accounting Revenue Bulletin (ARB 43), Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that ... under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges . . .. This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and are required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The company expects the adoption of SFAS 151 will not have a material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SEC Staffs interpretation of SFAS 123R and provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. In April 2005, the SEC amended Regulation S X to amend the date for compliance with SFAS 123R so that each registrant (that is not a small business issuer) will be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with SFAS 123R beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrants first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The company expects the adoption of SFAS 123R and related FASB Staff Positions (FSP) will have a material impact on its results of operations and earnings per share. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions (SFAS 153). The guidance in APB 29 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, 39 Table of Contents included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS 153 are applicable for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by this Interpretation are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, however the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The provisions of FIN 47 are effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, although early adoption is encouraged. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In June 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations (FSP 143 1). FSP 143 1 clarifies the accounting for obligations associated with Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the Directive) adopted by the European Union (EU). The Directive requires producers of electrical and electronic goods, including computers and printers, to be financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. The deadline for enacting and implementing the Directive by individual European Union governments was August 13, 2004 (such legislation, together with the Directive, the WEEE Legislation), although extensions were granted to some countries. Producers are to be financially responsible under the WEEE Legislation beginning in August 2005. The provisions of FSP 143 1 are effective for the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005, or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable EU member country. The adoption of FSP 143 1 did not have a material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2005, the FASB reached a final consensus on EITF Issue 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04 13). EITF 04 13 concludes that two or more legally separate exchange transactions with the same counterparty should be combined and considered as a single arrangement for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, when the transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another. The consensus contains several indicators to be considered in assessing whether two transactions are entered into in contemplation of one another. If, based on consideration of the indicators and the substance of the arrangement, two transactions are combined and considered a single arrangement, an exchange of finished goods inventory for either raw material or work in process should be accounted for at fair value. The provisions of EITF 04 13 should be applied to transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of EITF 04 13. 40 Table of Contents In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 was issued to address the accounting for rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period. FSP 13 1 concludes that these rental costs shall be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. The guidance in FSP 13 1 shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of FSP 13 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (collectively referred to as FSP 115 1). FSP 115 1 provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115 1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. FSP 115 1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of FSP 115 1. INFLATION The company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures. As a result, future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the companys business. In an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases, the company must continually manage its product costs and manufacturing processes. 41 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY The market risk inherent in the companys financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rates At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the companys senior notes was estimated at $156 million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements, taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt. The fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31, 2005, by approximately $6 million. Market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately $2 million at December 31, 2005. The company has interest rate swaps that serve as a fair value hedge of the companys senior notes. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2005, was a liability of $3 million. Market risk for the interest rate swaps is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately $2 million at December 31, 2005. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the companys functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. The primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar and other Asian and South American currencies. Exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, put options, and call options generally with maturity dates of less than eighteen months. The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2005, for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $54 million. This loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures. 42 Table of Contents
