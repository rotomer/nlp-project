Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company is a retail organization operating retail stores that sell a wide range of merchandise, including mens, womens and childrens apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. The Company operates coast to coast exclusively under two retail brands Macys and Bloomingdales. The Companys operations are significantly impacted by competitive pressures from department stores, specialty stores, mass merchandisers and all other retail channels. The Companys operations are also significantly impacted by general consumer spending levels, which are driven in part by consumer confidence and employment levels. In 2003, the Company commenced the implementation of a strategy to more fully utilize its Macys brand, converting all of the Companys regional store nameplates to the Macys nameplate. This strategy allowed the Company to magnify the impact of its marketing efforts on a nationwide basis, as well as to leverage major events such as the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade and Macys 4th of July fireworks. In early 2004, the Company announced a further step in reinventing its department stores the creation of a centralized organization to be responsible for the overall strategy, merchandising and marketing of the Companys home related categories of business in all of its Macys branded stores. While its benefits have taken longer to be realized, the centralized operation is still expected to accelerate future sales in these categories largely by improving and further differentiating the Companys home related merchandise assortments. For the past several years, the Company has been focused on four key priorities for improving the business over the longer term: differentiating and editing merchandise assortments; simplifying pricing; improving the overall shopping experience; and communicating better with customers through more brand focused and effective marketing. The Company believes that its recent results indicate that these strategies are working and that the customer is responding in a favorable manner. In 2005, the Company launched a new nationwide Macys customer loyalty program, called Star Rewards, in coordination with the launch of the Macys nameplate in cities across the country. The program provides an enhanced level of offers and benefits to Macys best credit card customers. On August 30, 2005, the Company completed its merger with May (the Merger). The results of Mays operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since that date. The aggregate purchase price for May was approximately $11.7 billion, including approximately $5.7 billion of cash and approximately 200 million shares of Company common stock and options to purchase an additional 18.8 million shares of Company common stock valued at approximately $6.0 billion in the aggregate. In connection with the Merger, the Company also assumed approximately $6.0 billion of May debt. The Merger has had and is expected to continue to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company was able to realize more than $175 million of cost savings in 2006 and expects to realize at least $450 million of annual cost savings starting in 2007, resulting from the consolidation of central functions, division integrations and the adoption of best practices across the combined company with respect to systems, logistics, store operations and credit management, all of which have been substantially completed as of February 2007. The Merger is also expected to accelerate comparable store sales growth. The Company has incurred approximately $628 million and $194 million of merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, the Company anticipates incurring approximately $100 to $125 million of May integration costs during fiscal 2007, which ends February 2, 2008. 14 Table of Contents In September 2005 and January 2006, the Company announced its intention to dispose of the acquired May bridal group business, which includes the operations of Davids Bridal, After Hours Formalwear and Priscilla of Boston, and the acquired Lord & Taylor division of May, respectively. In October 2006, the Company completed the sale of the Lord & Taylor division for $1,047 million in cash and a long term note receivable of approximately $17 million. In January 2007, the Company completed the sale of the Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses for approximately $740 million in cash. The Mens Wearhouse, Inc. has agreed to purchase the After Hours Formalwear business for approximately $100 million, less cash deposits on hand at the time of sale, and the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2007. As a result of the Companys decision to dispose of these businesses, these businesses are being reported as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise indicated, the following discussion relates to the Companys continuing operations. The Company added about 400 Macys locations nationwide in 2006 as it converted the regional department store nameplates acquired through the Merger. In conjunction with the conversion process, the Company has identified certain Macys and former May store locations to be divested. Locations identified for divestiture accounted for approximately $2.2 billion of 2005 sales on a pro forma basis. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had sold approximately 65 of the stores identified for divestiture. The Company is continuing to study its store portfolio in light of the Merger. In June 2005, the Company entered into a Purchase, Sale and Servicing Transfer Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Citibank, N.A. pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to Citibank (i) the proprietary and non proprietary credit card accounts owned by the Company, together with related receivables balances, and the capital stock of Prime Receivables Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which owned all of the Companys interest in the Prime Credit Card Master Trust (the FDS Credit Assets), (ii) the Macys credit card accounts owned by GE Capital Consumer Card Co. (GE Bank), together with related receivables balances (the GE/Macys Credit Assets), upon the termination of the Companys credit card program agreement with GE Bank, and (iii) the proprietary credit card accounts owned by May, together with related receivables balances (the May Credit Assets). The purchase by Citibank of the FDS Credit Assets was completed on October 24, 2005, the purchase by Citibank of the GE/Macys Credit Assets was completed on May 1, 2006 and the purchase by Citibank of the May Credit Assets was completed on May 22, 2006 and July 17, 2006. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Citibank entered into a long term marketing and servicing alliance pursuant to the terms of a Credit Card Program Agreement (the Program Agreement) with an initial term of 10 years expiring on July 17, 2016 and, unless terminated by either party as of the expiration of the initial term, an additional renewal term of three years. The Program Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the ownership by Citibank of the accounts purchased by Citibank pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the ownership by Citibank of new accounts opened by the Companys customers, (iii) the provision of credit by Citibank to the holders of the credit cards associated with the foregoing accounts, (iv) the servicing of the foregoing accounts, and (v) the allocation between Citibank and the Company of the economic benefits and burdens associated with the foregoing and other aspects of the alliance. The sales prices provided for in the Purchase Agreement equate to approximately 111.5% of the receivables included in the FDS Credit Assets, the GE/Macys Credit Assets and the May Credit Assets, and the Company will receive ongoing payments under the Program Agreement. The transactions completed under the Purchase Agreement and contemplated by the Program Agreement are expected to be accretive to the 15 Table of Contents Companys earnings per share, particularly now that the sales of the GE/Macys Credit Assets and the May Credit Assets have been completed. The transactions under the Purchase Agreement have provided the Company with significant liquidity (i) through receipt of the purchase price (which included a premium) for the divested credit card accounts and related receivable balances and (ii) because the Company will no longer have to finance significant accounts receivable balances associated with the divested credit card accounts going forward, and will receive payments from Citibank immediately for sales under such credit card accounts. Although the Companys future cash flows will include payments to the Company under the Program Agreement, these payments will be less than the net cash flow that the Company would have derived from the finance charge and other income generated on the receivables balances, net of the interest expense associated with the Companys financing of these receivable balances. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect the Companys plans, estimates and beliefs. The Companys actual results could materially differ from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Forward Looking Statements. Results of Operations Comparison of the 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006. Net income for 2006 decreased to $995 million compared to $1,406 million for 2005, reflecting strong sales and gross margin performance offset by higher May integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments and smaller gains on the sale of accounts receivable. Net sales for 2006 totaled $26,970 million, compared to net sales of $22,390 million for 2005, an increase of $4,580 million or 20.5%. Net sales for 2006 and for the period September 2005 through January 2006 include the continuing operations of May, which represented $9,832 million and $6,473 million, respectively. On a comparable store basis (sales from Bloomingdales and Macys stores in operation throughout 2005 and 2006 and all Internet sales and mail order sales from continuing businesses and adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week in 2006), net sales increased 4.4% in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales in 2006 were strongest at Macys Florida and Bloomingdales and comparable store sales were strongest at Macys East, Macys Florida and Bloomingdales. Sales for 2006 in the newly re branded Macys stores were lower than anticipated. Sales of the Companys private label brands continued to be strong in 2006 and increased to 18.2% of net sales in legacy Macys branded stores. By family of business, sales in 2006 were strongest in dresses, handbags, cosmetics and fragrances and young mens. The weaker businesses during 2006 continued to be in the big ticket home related areas. Cost of sales was $16,019 million or 59.4% of net sales for 2006, compared to $13,272 million or 59.3% of net sales for 2005, an increase of $2,747 million. Cost of sales for the period September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $3,894 million or 60.2% of May net sales. The cost of sales rate in 2006 was essentially flat with the cost of sales rate in 2005. In addition, gross margin includes $178 million and $25 million of inventory valuation adjustments related to the integration of May and Federated merchandise assortments in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The valuation of department store merchandise inventories on the last in, first out basis did not impact cost of sales in either period. 16 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $8,678 million or 32.2% of net sales for 2006, compared to $6,980 million or 31.2% of net sales for 2005, an increase of $1,698 million. SG&A expenses for the period September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $1,951 million or 30.1% of May net sales. The SG&A expense rate for 2006 was negatively impacted by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher retirement expenses, and higher stock based compensation expenses, including the expensing of stock options. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,265 million for 2006, compared to $976 million for 2005. Pension and supplementary retirement plan expense amounted to $158 million for 2006, compared to $129 million for 2005. Stock based compensation expense was $91 million for 2006, compared to $10 million for 2005. The SG&A rate for 2006 benefited by the achievement of more than $175 million of cost savings resulting from merger synergies. May integration costs for 2006 and 2005 amounted to $450 million and $169 million, respectively, primarily related to store and distribution center closings, as well as system conversions and other operational consolidations. May integration costs for 2006 also included re branding related marketing and advertising costs and were partially offset by gains from the sale of Federated locations. Pre tax gains of approximately $191 million and $480 million were recorded in 2006 and 2005, respectively, in connection with the sale of certain credit card accounts and receivables. Net interest expense was $390 million for 2006, compared to $380 million for 2005, an increase of $10 million. The increase in interest expense during 2006 as compared to 2005 is due to the increased levels of borrowings associated with the acquisition of May, offset in part by a gain of approximately $54 million related to the completion of a debt tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net interest expense for 2006 and 2005 each includes approximately $17 million of interest income related to the settlement of various tax examinations. The Companys effective income tax rates of 31.7% for 2006 and 32.8% for 2005 differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35.0%, and on a comparative basis, principally because of the settlement of tax examinations, the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with capital loss carryforwards and the effect of state and local income taxes. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2006 included a benefit of approximately $80 million recorded in the second quarter related to the settlement of various tax examinations, primarily attributable to losses related to the disposition of a former subsidiary. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2005 included a benefit of approximately $85 million related to the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with the capital loss carryforwards realized as a result of the sale of the FDS Credit Assets and $10 million related to the settlement of various tax examinations. For 2006, income from the discontinued operations of the acquired Lord & Taylor and bridal group businesses, net of income taxes, was $7 million on sales of approximately $1,741 million. For 2006, discontinued operations also includes the loss on disposal of the Lord & Taylor division of $38 million after income taxes and the loss on disposal of the Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses of $18 million after income taxes. The losses on disposal reflect reductions to the fair value of the assets sold based on the actual purchase agreements. For 2005, income from the discontinued operations of the acquired Lord & Taylor and bridal group businesses, net of income taxes, was $33 million on sales of approximately $957 million. Comparison of the 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006 and the 52 Weeks Ended January 29, 2005. Net income for 2005 increased to $1,406 million compared to $689 million for 2004. Net income for 2005 included income from discontinued operations of $33 million. The increase in income from continuing operations in 2005 reflected the $480 million gain on the sale of credit card accounts and receivables as well as the impact of the acquisition of May. 17 Table of Contents Net sales for 2005 totaled $22,390 million, compared to net sales of $15,776 million for 2004, an increase of $6,614 million or 41.9%. Net sales for September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $6,473 million. On a comparable store basis (sales from Bloomingdales and Macys stores in operation throughout 2004 and 2005 and all Internet sales and mail order sales from continuing businesses), net sales increased 1.3% compared to 2004. Sales in 2005 were strongest at Bloomingdales and Macys Florida. Sales of the Companys private label brands continued to be strong in 2005 in all Macys branded stores. By family of business, sales in 2005 were strong in shoes, handbags, cosmetics and fragrances and mens and womens sportswear. The weaker businesses during 2005 continued to be in the home related areas. Cost of sales was $13,272 million or 59.3% of net sales for 2005, compared to $9,382 million or 59.5% of net sales for 2004, an increase of $3,890 million. Cost of sales for September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $3,894 million or 60.2% of May net sales. Included in cost of sales for 2004 were $36 million of markdowns, 0.2% of net sales, associated with the Macys home store centralization and the Burdines Macys consolidation in Florida. The cost of sales rate in 2005 was essentially flat with the cost of sales rate in 2004, excluding the impact of the markdowns in 2004. These markdowns were primarily related to merchandise that was being sold at Macys branded stores and which was not reordered following the Burdines Macys consolidation and home store centralization. Gross margin for 2005 reflected $25 million of inventory valuation adjustments related to the integration of May and Federated merchandise assortments. The valuation of department store merchandise inventories on the last in, first out basis did not impact cost of sales in either period. SG&A expenses were $6,980 million or 31.2% of net sales for 2005, compared to $4,994 million or 31.6% of net sales for 2004, an increase of $1,986 million. SG&A expenses for September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $1,951 million or 30.1% of May net sales. Included in SG&A expenses for 2004 were approximately $63 million of costs, 0.4% of net sales, incurred in connection with store closings, the Burdines Macys consolidation and the home store centralization. The SG&A rate in 2005 was negatively impacted by the sale of the FDS Credit Assets. May integration costs for 2005 amounted to $169 million, primarily related to impairment charges for certain Macys stores to be closed and sold. A pre tax gain of approximately $480 million was recorded in 2005 in connection with the sale of the FDS Credit Assets. Net interest expense was $380 million for 2005, compared to $284 million for 2004, an increase of $96 million. The increase in interest expense during 2005 as compared to 2004 was due to the increased levels of borrowings associated with the acquisition of May, offset in part by the reduction in receivables backed borrowings due to the sale of the FDS Credit Assets. Net interest expense for 2005 included $17 million of interest income related to the settlement of various tax examinations. Net interest expense for 2004 included $59 million of costs associated with the repurchase of $274 million of the Companys 8.5% senior notes due 2010. The Companys effective income tax rates of 32.8% for 2005 and 38.3% for 2004 differed from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35.0%, and on a comparative basis, principally because of the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with capital loss carryforwards, the settlement of various tax examinations and the effect of state and local income taxes. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2005 included a benefit of approximately $85 million related to the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with the 18 Table of Contents capital loss carryforwards realized as a result of the sale of the FDS Credit Assets and $10 million related to the settlement of various tax examinations. For 2005, income from the discontinued operations of the acquired Lord & Taylor and bridal group businesses, net of income taxes, was $33 million on sales of approximately $957 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and the credit facilities described below. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2006 was $3,692 million, compared to the $4,145 million provided in 2005. The decrease in net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2006 reflects lower net income, lower proceeds from the sale of proprietary accounts receivable, and a greater decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher May integration costs and smaller gains on the sale of accounts receivable. Net cash provided by continuing investing activities was $1,273 million for 2006, compared to net cash used by continuing investing activities of $4,701 million for 2005. Continuing investing activities for 2006 included purchases of property and equipment totaling $1,317 million and capitalized software of $75 million. Continuing investing activities for 2006 also included the $1,141 million repurchase of accounts receivable from GE Bank and the proceeds of $1,323 million from the subsequent sale of the repurchased accounts receivables to Citibank, $1,047 million of proceeds from the disposition of the Companys Lord & Taylor division, $740 million of proceeds from the disposition of the Companys Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses and $679 million from disposal of property and equipment, primarily from the sale of approximately 65 duplicate store and other facility locations. Continuing investing activities for 2005 included purchases of property and equipment totaling $568 million, capitalized software of $88 million and an increase in non proprietary accounts receivable of $131 million. Continuing investing activities for 2005 also included the cash outflow associated with the acquisition of May of $5,321 million and the cash inflow associated with the sale of the non proprietary account portion of the FDS Credit Assets of $1,388 million. During 2006, the Company opened three new Macys department stores, two new Bloomingdales department stores and reopened two Macys department stores that were temporarily closed after Hurricane Wilma. During 2005, the Company opened two new Macys department stores and six new department stores under legacy May nameplates subsequent to the acquisition of May. The Company intends to open six new department stores and two new furniture galleries in 2007. The Companys budgeted capital expenditures are approximately $1.2 billion for 2007 and approximately $1.1 billion for each of 2008 and 2009. Management presently anticipates funding such expenditures with cash from operations. Net cash used by the Company for all continuing financing activities was $4,013 million for 2006, including the issuance of $1,146 million of long term debt, the repayment of $2,680 million of debt, the acquisition of 62.4 million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $2,500 million, the issuance of $382 million of its common stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options, and $274 million of cash dividends paid. The debt repaid in 2006 includes $1,199 million of short term borrowings associated with the acquisition of May, approximately $957 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes repurchased in a tender offer, $100 million of 8.85% senior debentures due 2006 and the prepayment of $200 million of 8.30% debentures due 2026. In November 2006, the Company issued $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% senior unsecured notes due 2016. In December 2006, the Company used the net proceeds of the issuance of such 19 Table of Contents notes, together with cash on hand, to repurchase approximately $957 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior unsecured notes, which had a net book value of approximately $1,201 million. The repurchased outstanding senior unsecured notes had stated interest rates ranging from 7.60% to 10.25%, a weighted average interest rate of 8.53% and maturities from 2019 to 2036. In connection with the repurchase of the senior unsecured notes, on November 21, 2006, the Company entered into reverse Treasury lock agreements, which are derivative financial instruments, with an aggregate notional amount of $900 million. These agreements were settled on December 4, 2006, with a net payment to the Company of approximately $4 million. The derivative financial instruments were used to mitigate the Companys exposure to interest rate sensitivity during the period between the date on which the 5.90% senior unsecured notes were priced and the date on which the applicable consideration payable with respect to the cash repurchase of senior unsecured notes was finalized. Net cash used by the Company for all continuing financing activities was $58 million for 2005, including the issuance of $4,580 million of short term debt used to finance the acquisition of May, the repayment of approximately $4,755 million of debt, the issuance of $336 million of its common stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options and $157 million of cash dividends paid. The debt repaid in 2005 includes $1.2 billion of receivables backed financings and approximately $3.4 billion of acquisition related borrowings, which repayments were primarily funded from the net proceeds received from the sale of the FDS Credit Assets. The Company acquired no shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program during 2005. In connection with the Merger, the Company entered into a 364 day bridge credit agreement with certain financial institutions providing for revolving credit borrowings in an aggregate amount initially not to exceed $5.0 billion outstanding at any particular time. On June 19, 2006, the Company terminated the 364 day bridge credit agreement. The Company is a party to a five year credit agreement with certain financial institutions providing for revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion (which amount may be increased to $2.5 billion at the option of the Company) outstanding at any particular time. This agreement was amended and restated and will now expire on August 30, 2011, replacing the previous agreement which was set to expire August 30, 2010. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the five year credit agreement. The Company maintains an unsecured commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell commercial paper in an aggregate amount outstanding at any particular time not to exceed its then current combined borrowing availability under the revolving credit facilities described above. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its commercial paper program. The Companys bank credit agreements require the Company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.25 and a specified leverage ratio of no more than .62. The interest coverage ratio for 2006 was 6.92 and at February 3, 2007 the leverage ratio was .37. Management believes that the likelihood of the Company defaulting on these requirements in the future is remote absent any material negative event affecting the U.S. economy as a whole. However, if the Companys results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with any of its debt covenants and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Companys debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. 20 Table of Contents On August 25, 2006, the Companys board of directors approved an additional $2,000 million authorization to the Companys existing share repurchase program. The new authorization was additive to the existing repurchase program, which as of February 3, 2007 had approximately $170 million of authorization remaining. On February 26, 2007, the Companys board of directors approved an additional $4,000 million authorization to the Companys existing share repurchase program. The Company used a portion of this authorization to effect the immediate repurchase of 45 million outstanding shares for an initial payment of approximately $2,000 million, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the related accelerated share repurchase agreements. With this additional authorization to the share repurchase program and the immediate repurchase agreements entered into by the Company, the repurchase program had approximately $2,170 million of authorization remaining as of April 3, 2007. The Company may continue or, from time to time, suspend repurchases of shares under its stock repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. On February 26, 2007, the Companys board of directors also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 12.75 cents per share on its common stock, payable April 2, 2007 to Federated shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2007. On March 7, 2007, the Company issued $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.35% senior unsecured notes due 2012 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2037. The net proceeds of the debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper borrowings incurred in connection with the accelerated share repurchase agreements and the balance will be used for general corporate purposes. At February 3, 2007, the Company had contractual obligations (within the scope of Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S K) as follows: Obligations Due, by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (millions) Short term debt $ 645 $ 645 $ $ $ Long term debt 7,423 1,624 901 4,898 Interest on debt 5,837 523 923 758 3,633 Capital lease obligations 88 10 18 15 45 Other long term liabilities 1,362 6 422 250 684 Operating leases 2,802 225 404 347 1,826 Letters of credit 53 53 Other obligations 2,412 2,190 222 $ 20,622 $ 3,652 $ 3,613 $ 2,271 $ 11,086 Other obligations in the foregoing table consist primarily of significant merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements, construction contracts, employment contracts, group medical/dental/life insurance programs and energy and other supply agreements identified by the Company. The Companys merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis, typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts. Consequently, the amounts shown as Other obligations in the foregoing table do 21 Table of Contents not reflect the total amounts that the Company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course. Management believes that, with respect to the Companys current operations, cash on hand and funds from operations, together with its credit facilities and other capital resources, will be sufficient to cover the Companys reasonably foreseeable working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements in both the near term and over the longer term. The Companys ability to generate funds from operations may be affected by numerous factors, including general economic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and demand; however, the Company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. For short term liquidity, the Company also relies on its unsecured commercial paper facility (which is discussed above). Access to the unsecured commercial paper program is primarily dependent on the Companys credit ratings; a downgrade in its short term ratings could hinder its ability to access this market. If the Company is unable to access the unsecured commercial paper market, it has the current ability to access $2.0 billion pursuant to its bank credit agreement, subject to compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratio requirements discussed above and other requirements under the agreement. Depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities, or other possible capital markets transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes. Management believes the department store business and other retail businesses will continue to consolidate. The Company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of, and investments in, department stores and other complementary assets and companies. Acquisition transactions, if any, are expected to be financed from one or more of the following sources: cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under existing or new credit facilities and the issuance of long term debt, commercial paper or other securities, including common stock. Critical Accounting Policies Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, and is stated at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity. The retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins. Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. The Company receives certain allowances from various vendors in support of the merchandise it purchases for resale. The Company receives certain allowances as reimbursement for markdowns taken and or to support the gross margins earned in connection with the sales of merchandise. These allowances are 22 Table of Contents generally credited to cost of sales at the time the merchandise is sold in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. The Company also receives advertising allowances from more than 1,200 of its merchandise vendors pursuant to cooperative advertising programs, with some vendors participating in multiple programs. These allowances represent reimbursements by vendors of costs incurred by the Company to promote the vendors merchandise and are netted against advertising and promotional costs when the related costs are incurred in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02 16. The arrangements pursuant to which the Companys vendors provide allowances, while binding, are generally informal in nature and one year or less in duration. The terms and conditions of these arrangements vary significantly from vendor to vendor and are influenced by, among other things, the type of merchandise to be supported. Although it is highly unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur, the Company could experience higher costs of sales and higher advertising expense, or reduce the amount of advertising that it uses, depending on the specific vendors involved and market conditions existing at the time. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, the Company has loss prevention programs and policies that are intended to minimize shrinkage. Physical inventories are generally taken within each merchandise department annually, and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges The carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed by the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. For long lived assets held for use, a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations. When a potential impairment has occurred, an impairment write down is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long lived assets. If estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future, the Company may be required to record asset impairment write downs. For long lived assets held for disposal by sale, an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value less costs to sell. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. For long lived assets to be abandoned, the Company considers the asset to be disposed of when it ceases to be used. If the Company commits to a plan to abandon a long lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised accordingly. In addition, liabilities arise such as severance, contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets. The Company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded. The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment. The impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach at the reporting unit level that requires significant management judgment with respect to sales, gross margin and expense growth rates, and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would 23 Table of Contents increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge. The occurrence of an unexpected event or change in circumstances, such as adverse business conditions or other economic factors, would determine the need for impairment testing between annual impairment tests. Self Insurance Reserves The Company is self insured for workers compensation and public liability claims up to certain maximum liability amounts. Although the amounts accrued are actuarially determined by third parties based on analysis of historical trends of losses, settlements, litigation costs and other factors, the amounts the Company will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts. Pension and Supplementary Retirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158), which requires, among other things, an employer to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The recognition and disclosure provisions of this statement were adopted by the Company for fiscal year 2006. Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted the remaining provision of SFAS 158, which requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations to be the date of the Companys fiscal year end balance sheet. This required a change in the Companys measurement date, which was previously December 31. The Company has a funded defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan) and an unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the SERP). The Company accounts for these plans using SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), as amended by SFAS No. 158. Under SFAS 87 and SFAS 158, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods. Pension expense calculated under SFAS 87 and SFAS 158 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. The Company anticipates that pension expense and other retirement costs relating to continuing operations will decrease by approximately $20 million in 2007, compared to 2006. Funding requirements for the Pension Plan are determined by government regulations, not SFAS 87 or SFAS 158. Although no funding contributions were required, the Company made a $100 million voluntary funding contribution to the Pension Plan in 2006 and a $136 million voluntary funding contribution to the Pension Plan in 2005. The Company currently anticipates that it will not be required to make any additional contributions to the Pension Plan until 2009. As of the date of this report, the Company is considering making a voluntary funding contribution to the Pension Plan of $180 million prior to February 2, 2008. During 2006, Congress passed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) with the stated purpose of improving the funding of Americas private pension plans. The Act introduces new funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, introduces benefit limitations for certain under funded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions. The Act applies to pension plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. The Company has preliminarily reviewed the provisions of the Act to determine the impact on the Company. Required funding under the Act will be dependent upon many factors including the Pension Plans future funded status including any voluntary funding contributions the Company may choose to make and annual Pension Plan asset returns. Based upon this preliminary review as well as the current funded status of the Pension Plan relative to the Companys level of annual operating cash flows, the Company does not believe 24 Table of Contents that required contributions under the Act would materially impact the Companys operating cash flows in any given year. At February 3, 2007, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of $296 million for the Pension Plan and $75 million for the SERP. These losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years in accordance with SFAS No. 158. The calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long term rate of return on plan assets (in the case of the Pension Plan), the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations and the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels. The Company has assumed that the Pension Plans assets will generate an annual long term rate of return of 8.75% since 2004. The Company develops its long term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long term asset class return expectations, as well as long term inflation assumptions. Pension expense increases or decreases as the expected rate of return on the assets of the Pension Plan decreases or increases, respectively. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on the Pension Plans assets by 0.25% (from 8.75% to 8.50%) would increase the estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $6 million and raising the expected long term rate of return on the Pension Plans assets by 0.25% (from 8.75% to 9.00%) would decrease the estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $6 million. The Company discounted its future pension obligations using a rate of 5.85% at December 31, 2006, compared to 5.70% at December 31, 2005. The Company determines the appropriate discount rate with reference to the current yield earned on an index of investment grade long term bonds and the impact of a yield curve analysis to account for the difference in duration between the long term bonds and the Pension Plans and SERPs estimated payments. Pension liability and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the discount rate is reduced or increased, respectively. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25% (from 5.85% to 5.60%) would increase the projected benefit obligation at February 3, 2007 by approximately $109 million and would increase estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $15 million. Increasing the discount rate by 0.25% (from 5.85% to 6.10%) would decrease the projected benefit obligation at February 3, 2007 by approximately $105 million and would decrease estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $12 million. The assumed weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels was 5.4% as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 for the Pension Plan, and 7.2% as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 for the SERP. The Company develops its increase of future compensation level assumption based on recent experience. Pension liabilities and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels is increased or decreased, respectively. Increasing or decreasing the assumed weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels by 0.25% would increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation at February 3, 2007 by approximately $13 million and change estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $3 million. New Pronouncements Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective transition method. This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, 25 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Under the provisions of this statement, the Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments and the amortization method for compensation cost. The modified prospective transition method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of this statement, for all share based payments granted after the effective date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123, for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain nonvested on the effective date. See Note 15, Stock Based Compensation, for further information. Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Effective January 29, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This statement eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretations regarding the process of quantifying prior year financial statement misstatements for the purposes of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 provides guidance that the following two methodologies should be used to quantify prior year income statement misstatements: (i) the error is quantified as the amount by which the income statement is misstated, and (ii) the error is quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated. SAB No. 108 concludes that a company should quantify a misstatement using both of these methodologies. Historically, the Company evaluated the impact of financial statement misstatements for the purposes of a materiality assessment on a current year income statement approach. The interpretation is effective for evaluations made on or after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Also in September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, which requires an employer to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The recognition and disclosure provisions of this statement were adopted by the Company for fiscal year 2006. See Note 13, Retirement Plans, for further information. 26 Table of Contents The incremental effects of applying the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 on line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 3, 2007 were as follows: Before Application After Application of SFAS No. 158 Adjustments of SFAS No. 158 (thousands) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 4,866 $ 78 $ 4,944 Deferred income taxes 1,895 (115 ) 1,780 Other liabilities 1,151 211 1,362 Total liabilities 17,122 174 17,296 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (8 ) (174 ) (182 ) Total Shareholders Equity 12,428 (174 ) 12,254 Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted the remaining provisions of SFAS 158, which require the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations to be the date of the Companys fiscal year end balance sheet. This required a change in the Companys measurement date, which was previously December 31. The adoption of the remaining provisions of this statement resulted in an adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated equity on February 4, 2007 of approximately $8 million in order to recognize post employment and postretirement benefit expense for January 2007 and also reduced estimated 2007 post employment and postretirement benefit expense, due to the change in the discount rate at February 3, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006, by approximately $6 million. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be recognized as an adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated equity. The initial adoption of FIN 48 on February 4, 2007 did not have a material impact on the Companys beginning of year consolidated financial position and is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Companys fiscal 2007 results of operations or cash flows. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155), which amended certain provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement (new basis) event after the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company does not anticipate adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition and disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 will require the fair value of an asset or liability to be based on a market based measure which will reflect the credit risk of the company. SFAS 157 will also require expanded disclosure requirements which will include the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and to 27 Table of Contents interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that may adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the Company manages exposures through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged financial instruments. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its customer lending and borrowing activities, which are described in Notes 6 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of the Companys borrowings are under fixed rate instruments. However, the Company, from time to time, may use interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to help manage its exposure to interest rate movements and reduce borrowing costs. At February 3, 2007, the Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments. In connection with the repurchase of senior unsecured notes, on November 21, 2006, the Company entered into reverse Treasury lock agreements, which are derivative financial instruments, with an aggregate notional amount of $900 million. These agreements were settled on December 4, 2006, with a net payment to the Company of approximately $4 million. The derivative financial instruments were used to mitigate the Companys exposure to interest rate sensitivity during the period between the date on which the 5.90% senior unsecured notes were priced and the date on which the applicable consideration payable with respect to the cash repurchase of senior unsecured notes was finalized. See Notes 10 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. Based on the Companys lack of market risk sensitive instruments (primarily limited to variable rate debt) outstanding at February 3, 2007, the Company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of such date. 28
