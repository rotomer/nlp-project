Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company is a retail organization operating retail stores that sell a wide range of merchandise, including mens, womens and childrens apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. The Company operates coast to coast exclusively under two retail brands Macys and Bloomingdales. The Companys operations are significantly impacted by competitive pressures from department stores, specialty stores, mass merchandisers and all other retail channels. The Companys operations are also significantly impacted by general consumer spending levels, which are driven in part by consumer confidence and employment levels. In 2003, the Company commenced the implementation of a strategy to more fully utilize its Macys brand, converting all of the Companys regional store nameplates to the Macys nameplate. This strategy allowed the Company to magnify the impact of its marketing efforts on a nationwide basis, as well as to leverage major events such as the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade and Macys 4th of July fireworks. In early 2004, the Company announced a further step in reinventing its department stores the creation of a centralized organization to be responsible for the overall strategy, merchandising and marketing of the Companys home related categories of business in all of its Macys branded stores. While its benefits have taken longer to be realized, the centralized operation is still expected to accelerate future sales in these categories largely by improving and further differentiating the Companys home related merchandise assortments. For the past several years, the Company has been focused on four key priorities for improving the business over the longer term: (i) differentiating and editing merchandise assortments; (ii) simplifying pricing; (iii) improving the overall shopping experience; and (iv) communicating better with customers through more brand focused and effective marketing. In 2005, the Company launched a new nationwide Macys customer loyalty program, called Star Rewards, in coordination with the launch of the Macys nameplate in cities across the country. The program provides an enhanced level of offers and benefits to Macys best credit card customers. On August 30, 2005, the Company completed its merger with May (the Merger). The results of Mays operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since that date. The aggregate purchase price for May was approximately $11.7 billion, including approximately $5.7 billion of cash and approximately 200 million shares of Company common stock and options to purchase an additional 18.8 million shares of Company common stock valued at approximately $6.0 billion in the aggregate. In connection with the Merger, the Company also assumed approximately $6.0 billion of May debt. The Merger has had and is expected to continue to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2005 and January 2006, the Company announced its intention to dispose of the acquired May bridal group business, which included the operations of Davids Bridal, After Hours Formalwear and Priscilla of Boston, and the acquired Lord Taylor division of May, respectively. In October 2006, the Company completed the sale of the Lord Taylor division for $1,047 million in cash, a long term note receivable of approximately $17 million and a receivable for a working capital adjustment to the purchase price of approximately $23 million. In January 2007, the Company completed the sale of the Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses for approximately $740 million in cash, net of $10 million of transaction costs. In April 2007, the Company completed the sale of its After Hours Formalwear business for approximately $66 million in cash, net of $1 million of transaction costs. As a result of the Companys 16 decision to dispose of these businesses, these businesses are reported as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise indicated, the following discussion relates to the Companys continuing operations. In June 2005, the Company entered into a Purchase, Sale and Servicing Transfer Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Citibank, N.A. pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to Citibank (i) the proprietary and non proprietary credit card accounts owned by the Company, together with related receivables balances, and the capital stock of Prime Receivables Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which owned all of the Companys interest in the Prime Credit Card Master Trust (the FDS Credit Assets), (ii) the Macys credit card accounts owned by GE Capital Consumer Card Co. (GE Bank), together with related receivables balances (the GE/Macys Credit Assets), upon the termination of the Companys credit card program agreement with GE Bank, and (iii) the proprietary credit card accounts owned by May, together with related receivables balances (the May Credit Assets). The purchase by Citibank of the FDS Credit Assets was completed on October 24, 2005, the purchase by Citibank of the GE/Macys Credit Assets was completed on May 1, 2006 and the purchase by Citibank of the May Credit Assets was completed on May 22, 2006 and July 17, 2006. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Citibank entered into a long term marketing and servicing alliance pursuant to the terms of a Credit Card Program Agreement (the Program Agreement) with an initial term of 10 years expiring on July 17, 2016 and, unless terminated by either party as of the expiration of the initial term, an additional renewal term of three years. The Program Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the ownership by Citibank of the accounts purchased by Citibank pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the ownership by Citibank of new accounts opened by the Companys customers, (iii) the provision of credit by Citibank to the holders of the credit cards associated with the foregoing accounts, (iv) the servicing of the foregoing accounts, and (v) the allocation between Citibank and the Company of the economic benefits and burdens associated with the foregoing and other aspects of the alliance. The transactions under the Purchase Agreement have provided the Company with significant liquidity (i) through receipt of the purchase price (which included a premium) for the divested credit card accounts and related receivable balances and (ii) because the Company will no longer have to finance significant accounts receivable balances associated with the divested credit card accounts going forward, and will receive payments from Citibank immediately for sales under such credit card accounts. Although the Companys future cash flows will include payments to the Company under the Program Agreement, these payments will be less than the net cash flow that the Company would have derived from the finance charge and other income generated on the receivables balances, net of the interest expense associated with the Companys financing of these receivable balances. In February 2008, the Company announced division consolidations and new initiatives to strengthen local market focus and enhance selling service expected to enable the Company to both accelerate same store sales growth and reduce expense. The localization initiative called My Macys was developed with the goal to accelerate sales growth in existing locations by ensuring that core customers surrounding each Macys store find merchandise assortments, size ranges, marketing programs and shopping experiences that are custom tailored to their needs. The localization initiative will result in the consolidation of the Minneapolis based Macys North organization into New York based Macys East, the St. Louis based Macys Midwest organization into Atlanta based Macys South and the Seattle based Macys Northwest organization into San Francisco based Macys West. The Atlanta based division will be renamed Macys Central. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $150 million in one time costs for expenses related to the division consolidations, consisting primarily of severance and other human resource related costs. The savings from the division consolidation process, net of the amount 17 invested in localization initiatives and increased store staffing levels, are expected to reduce selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses by approximately $100 million per year, beginning in 2009. The partial year reduction in SGA expenses for 2008 is estimated at approximately $60 million. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect the Companys plans, estimates and beliefs. The Companys actual results could materially differ from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Forward Looking Statements. Results of Operations Comparison of the 52 Weeks Ended February 2, 2008 and the 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007. Net income for 2007 decreased to $893 million compared to $995 million for 2006. The net income for 2007 includes income from continuing operations of $909 million and a loss from discontinued operations of $16 million. The income from continuing operations in 2007 includes the impact of $219 million of May integration costs. The loss from discontinued operations in 2007 includes the loss on disposal of the After Hours Formalwear business. The net income for 2006 included income from continuing operations of $988 million and income from discontinued operations of $7 million. The income from continuing operations in 2006 included the impact of $628 million of May integration costs and the impact of $191 million of gains on the sale of accounts receivable. The income from discontinued operations for 2006 included the loss on disposal of the Lord Taylor division and the loss on disposal of the Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses. Net sales for 2007 totaled $26,313 million, compared to net sales of $26,970 million for 2006, a decrease of $657 million or 2.4%. On a comparable store basis (sales from Bloomingdales and Macys stores in operation throughout 2006 and 2007 and all Internet sales and mail order sales from continuing businesses and adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week in 2006), net sales decreased 1.3% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales in 2007 were strongest at Bloomingdales and macys.com. Sales of the Companys private label brands in total outperformed the national brands for 2007 and increased to approximately 19% of net sales in Macys branded stores. By family of business, sales in 2007 were strongest in handbags, young mens apparel, coats, watches, luggage and mattresses. The weaker business during 2007 was ladies sportswear. Cost of sales was $15,677 million or 59.6% of net sales for 2007, compared to $16,019 million or 59.4% of net sales for 2006, a decrease of $342 million. The cost of sales rate for 2007 reflects higher net markdowns as a percent of net sales intended to keep inventories current. In addition, gross margin in 2006 included $178 million of inventory valuation adjustments related to the integration of May and Macys merchandise assortments. The valuation of department store merchandise inventories on the last in, first out basis did not impact cost of sales in either period. SGA expenses were $8,554 million or 32.5% of net sales for 2007, compared to $8,678 million or 32.2% of net sales for 2006, a decrease of $124 million. SGA expenses for 2007 benefited from the achievement of cost savings and merger synergies, primarily related to merchandising, logistics and general management expenses. In addition, SGA expenses benefited from lower retirement expenses and lower stock based compensation expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses, lower credit revenue resulting from the sale of the May Credit Assets in 2006 and higher advertising expenses. SGA expenses, as a percent to sales was higher in 2007 primarily because of the decrease in sales. 18 Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,304 million for 2007, compared to $1,265 million for 2006. Pension and supplementary retirement plan expense amounted to $132 million for 2007, compared to $158 million for 2006. Stock based compensation expense was $60 million for 2007, compared to $91 million for 2006. Advertising expense was $1,194 million for 2007, compared to $1,171 million for 2006. May integration costs for 2007 amounted to $219 million. Approximately $121 million of these costs relate to impairment charges in connection with store locations and distribution facilities planned to be closed and disposed of, including $74 million related to nine underperforming stores identified in the fourth quarter of 2007 for closure. The remaining $98 million of May integration costs for 2007 included additional costs related to closed locations, severance, system conversion costs, impairment charges associated with acquired indefinite lived intangible assets and costs related to other operational consolidations, partially offset by approximately $41 million of gains from the sale of previously closed distribution center facilities. May integration costs for 2006 amounted to $450 million, primarily related to store and distribution center closings and the re branding related marketing and advertising costs, partially offset by gains from the sale of Macys locations. Pre tax gains of approximately $191 million were recorded in 2006 in connection with the sale of certain credit card accounts and receivables. Net interest expense was $543 million for 2007, compared to $390 million for 2006, an increase of $153 million. The increase in net interest expense for 2007, as compared to 2006, resulted from increased levels of borrowings during 2007, primarily associated with the Companys share repurchase program, a gain of approximately $54 million related to the completion of a debt tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the effect of $17 million of interest income in 2006 related to the settlement of a federal income tax examination. The Companys effective income tax rates of 31.1% for 2007 and 31.7% for 2006 differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35.0%, and on a comparative basis, principally because of the settlement of tax examinations and the effect of state and local income taxes. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2007 includes a benefit of approximately $78 million related to the settlement of a federal income tax examination, primarily attributable to losses related to the disposition of a former subsidiary. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2006 included a benefit of approximately $80 million related to the settlement of a federal income tax examination, also primarily attributable to losses related to the disposition of a former subsidiary. For 2007, the loss from the discontinued operations of the acquired After Hours Formalwear business, net of income taxes, was $16 million on sales of approximately $27 million. The loss from discontinued operations includes the loss on disposal of the After Hours Formalwear business of $7 million on a pre tax and post tax basis. For 2006, income from the discontinued operations of the acquired Lord Taylor and bridal group businesses, net of income taxes, was $7 million on sales of approximately $1,741 million. For 2006, discontinued operations also included the loss on disposal of the Lord Taylor division of $38 million after income taxes and the loss on disposal of the Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses of $18 million after income taxes. Comparison of the 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006. Net income for 2006 decreased to $995 million compared to $1,406 million for 2005, reflecting strong sales and gross margin performance offset by higher May integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments and smaller gains on the sale of accounts receivable. 19 Net sales for 2006 totaled $26,970 million, compared to net sales of $22,390 million for 2005, an increase of $4,580 million or 20.5%. Net sales for 2006 and for the period September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $9,832 million and $6,473 million, respectively. On a comparable store basis (sales from Bloomingdales and Macys stores in operation throughout 2005 and 2006 and all Internet sales and mail order sales from continuing businesses and adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week in 2006), net sales increased 4.4% in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales in 2006 were strongest at Macys Florida and Bloomingdales and comparable store sales were strongest at Macys East, Macys Florida and Bloomingdales. Sales for 2006 in the newly re branded Macys stores were lower than anticipated. Sales of the Companys private label brands continued to be strong in 2006 and increased to 18.2% of net sales in legacy Macys branded stores. By family of business, sales in 2006 were strongest in dresses, handbags, cosmetics and fragrances and young mens. The weaker businesses during 2006 were in the big ticket home related areas. Cost of sales was $16,019 million or 59.4% of net sales for 2006, compared to $13,272 million or 59.3% of net sales for 2005, an increase of $2,747 million. Cost of sales for the period September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $3,894 million or 60.2% of May net sales. The cost of sales rate in 2006 was essentially flat with the cost of sales rate in 2005. In addition, gross margin included $178 million and $25 million of inventory valuation adjustments related to the integration of May and Macys merchandise assortments in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The valuation of department store merchandise inventories on the last in, first out basis did not impact cost of sales in either period. SGA expenses were $8,678 million or 32.2% of net sales for 2006, compared to $6,980 million or 31.2% of net sales for 2005, an increase of $1,698 million. SGA expenses for the period September 2005 through January 2006 included the continuing operations of May, which represented $1,951 million or 30.1% of May net sales. The SGA expense rate for 2006 was negatively impacted by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher retirement expenses, and higher stock based compensation expenses, including the expensing of stock options. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,265 million for 2006, compared to $976 million for 2005. Pension and supplementary retirement plan expense amounted to $158 million for 2006, compared to $129 million for 2005. Stock based compensation expense was $91 million for 2006, compared to $10 million for 2005. The SGA rate for 2006 benefited by the achievement of more than $175 million of cost savings resulting from merger synergies. May integration costs for 2006 and 2005 amounted to $450 million and $169 million, respectively, primarily related to store and distribution center closings, as well as system conversions and other operational consolidations. May integration costs for 2006 also included re branding related marketing and advertising costs and were partially offset by gains from the sale of Macys locations. Pre tax gains of approximately $191 million and $480 million were recorded in 2006 and 2005, respectively, in connection with the sale of certain credit card accounts and receivables. Net interest expense was $390 million for 2006, compared to $380 million for 2005, an increase of $10 million. The increase in interest expense during 2006 as compared to 2005 was due to the increased levels of borrowings associated with the acquisition of May, offset in part by a gain of approximately $54 million related to the completion of a debt tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net interest expense for 2006 and 2005 each included approximately $17 million of interest income related to the settlement of various tax examinations. 20 The Companys effective income tax rates of 31.7% for 2006 and 32.8% for 2005 differed from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35.0%, and on a comparative basis, principally because of the settlement of tax examinations, the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with capital loss carryforwards and the effect of state and local income taxes. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2006 included a benefit of approximately $80 million recorded in the second quarter related to the settlement of various tax examinations, primarily attributable to losses related to the disposition of a former subsidiary. Federal, state and local income tax expense for 2005 included a benefit of approximately $85 million related to the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with the capital loss carryforwards realized as a result of the sale of the FDS Credit Assets and $10 million related to the settlement of various tax examinations. For 2006, income from the discontinued operations of the acquired Lord Taylor and bridal group businesses, net of income taxes, was $7 million on sales of approximately $1,741 million. For 2006, discontinued operations also included the loss on disposal of the Lord Taylor division of $38 million after income taxes and the loss on disposal of the Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses of $18 million after income taxes. For 2005, income from the discontinued operations of the acquired Lord Taylor and bridal group businesses, net of income taxes, was $33 million on sales of approximately $957 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and the credit facilities described below. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2007 was $2,231 million, compared to the $3,692 million provided in 2006. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2006 included $1,860 million of proceeds from the sale of proprietary accounts receivable. Net cash used by continuing investing activities was $789 million for 2007, compared to net cash provided by continuing investing activities of $1,273 million for 2006. Continuing investing activities for 2007 include purchases of property and equipment totaling $994 million and capitalized software of $111 million. Continuing investing activities for 2007 also include the proceeds of $66 million from the disposition of the discontinued operations of After Hours Formalwear and $227 million from the disposition of property and equipment, primarily from the sale of previously closed distribution center facilities and certain store locations. Continuing investing activities for 2006 included purchases of property and equipment totaling $1,317 million and capitalized software of $75 million. Continuing investing activities for 2006 also included the $1,141 million repurchase of accounts receivable from GE Bank and the proceeds of $1,323 million from the subsequent sale of the repurchased accounts receivables to Citibank, $1,047 million of proceeds from the disposition of the Companys Lord Taylor division, $740 million of proceeds from the disposition of the Companys Davids Bridal and Priscilla of Boston businesses and $679 million from the disposition of property and equipment, primarily from the sale of approximately 65 duplicate store and other facility locations. During 2007, the Company opened nine Macys department stores, one Macys furniture gallery and two Bloomingdales department stores. During 2006, the Company opened three new Macys department stores, two new Bloomingdales department stores and reopened two Macys department stores that were temporarily closed after Hurricane Wilma. The Company intends to open five new department stores and one new furniture gallery in 2008. The Companys budgeted capital expenditures are approximately $1.0 billion for 2008 and approximately $1.1 billion for each of 2009 and 2010. Management presently anticipates funding such expenditures with cash from operations. 21 Net cash used by the Company for all continuing financing activities was $2,069 million for 2007, including the issuance of $1,950 million of long term debt, the repayment of $649 million of debt, the acquisition of 85.3 million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $3,322 million, the issuance of $257 million of its common stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options, and the payment of $230 million of cash dividends. The debt issued during 2007 includes $1,100 million of 5.35% senior notes due 2012, $500 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2037 and $350 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2013. The debt repaid in 2007 includes $400 million of 3.95% senior notes due July 15, 2007, $6 million of 9.93% medium term notes due August 1, 2007 and $225 million of 7.9% senior debentures due October 15, 2007. Net cash used by the Company for all continuing financing activities was $4,013 million for 2006, including the issuance of $1,146 million of long term debt, the repayment of $2,680 million of debt, the acquisition of 62.4 million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $2,500 million, the issuance of $382 million of its common stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options, and the payment of $274 million of cash dividends. The debt issued during 2006 included $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% senior unsecured notes due 2016. The debt repaid in 2006 included $1,199 million of short term borrowings associated with the acquisition of May, approximately $957 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes repurchased in a tender offer, $100 million of 8.85% senior debentures due 2006 and the prepayment of $200 million of 8.30% debentures due 2026. The Company is a party to a credit agreement with certain financial institutions providing for revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,000 million (which amount may be increased to $2,500 million at the option of the Company) outstanding at any particular time. This agreement was set to expire August 30, 2011. It was extended in 2007 and will now expire August 30, 2012. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. The Company also maintains an unsecured commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell commercial paper in an aggregate amount outstanding at any particular time not to exceed its then current borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility described above. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its commercial paper program. The Companys bank credit agreement requires the Company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.25 and a specified leverage ratio of no more than .62. The interest coverage ratio for 2007 was 5.81 and at February 2, 2008 the leverage ratio was .48. Management believes that the likelihood of the Company defaulting on these requirements in the future is remote absent any material negative event affecting the U.S. economy as a whole. However, if the Companys results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the Company is not in compliance with any of its debt covenants and the Company is unable to obtain a waiver, much of the Companys debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. At February 2, 2008, no notes or debentures contain provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade. However, the terms of $3,050 million in aggregate principal amount of the Companys senior notes outstanding at that date require the Company to offer to purchase such notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in specified circumstances involving both a change of control (as defined in the applicable indenture) of the Company and the rating of the notes by specified rating agencies at a level below investment grade. On February 26, 2007, the Companys board of directors approved an additional $4,000 million authorization to the Companys existing share repurchase program. The Company used a portion of this authorization to effect the immediate repurchase of 45 million outstanding shares for an initial payment of approximately $2,000 million, pursuant to the terms of two related accelerated share repurchase agreements, 22 which included derivative financial instruments indexed to the Companys shares. Upon settlement of the accelerated share repurchase agreements in May and June of 2007, the Company received approximately 700,000 additional shares of its common stock, resulting in a total of approximately 45.7 million shares being repurchased. During 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 85.3 million shares of its common stock for a total of approximately $3,322 million. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had approximately $850 million of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program. The Company may continue or, from time to time, suspend repurchases of shares under its share repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. On March 7, 2007, the Company issued $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.35% senior unsecured notes due 2012 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2037. A portion of the net proceeds of the debt issuances was used to repay commercial paper borrowings incurred in connection with the accelerated share repurchase agreements, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes. On August 28, 2007, the Company issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2013. The net proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper facility. On February 22, 2008, the Companys board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 13 cents per share on its common stock, payable April 1, 2008 to Macys shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2008. At February 2, 2008, the Company had contractual obligations (within the scope of Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S K) as follows: Obligations Due, by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (millions) Short term debt $ 661 $ 661 $ $ $ Long term debt 8,711 1,200 2,326 5,185 Interest on debt 6,632 607 1,047 888 4,090 Capital lease obligations 69 8 14 12 35 Other long term liabilities 1,363 6 349 280 728 Operating leases 2,798 231 427 359 1,781 Letters of credit 45 45 Other obligations 2,409 2,155 223 25 6 $ 22,688 $ 3,713 $ 3,260 $ 3,890 $ 11,825 Other obligations in the foregoing table consist primarily of merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements, construction contracts, employment contracts, group medical/dental/life insurance programs, energy and other supply agreements identified by the Company and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that the Company expects to settle in cash in the next year. The Companys merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis, typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts. Consequently, 23 the amounts shown as Other obligations in the foregoing table do not reflect the total amounts that the Company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course. The Company has not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $229 million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions taken or approximately $60 million of related accrued federal, state and local interest and penalties. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of examinations, the Company cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. The Company has included in the contractual obligations table $8 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that the Company expects to settle in cash in the next year. The Company has not included in the contractual obligations table the $337 million Pension Plan liability. The Companys funding policy is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, including requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the Pension Plans funded status. The Pension Plans funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of Pension Plan assets. The Company currently anticipates that it will not be required to make any additional contributions to the Pension Plan until January 2010, but may make voluntary funding contributions prior to that date based on the estimate of the Pension Plans expected funded status. As of the date of this report, the Company is considering making a voluntary funding contribution to the Pension Plan of approximately $175 million in December 2008. Management believes that, with respect to the Companys current operations, cash on hand and funds from operations, together with its credit facility and other capital resources, will be sufficient to cover the Companys reasonably foreseeable working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements in both the near term and over the longer term. The Companys ability to generate funds from operations may be affected by numerous factors, including general economic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and demand; however, the Company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. For short term liquidity, the Company also relies on its unsecured commercial paper facility (which is discussed above). Access to the unsecured commercial paper program is primarily dependent on the Companys credit ratings. If the Company is unable to access the unsecured commercial paper market, it has the current ability to access $2,000 million pursuant to its bank credit agreement, subject to compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratio requirements discussed above and other requirements under the agreement. Depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities, or other possible capital markets transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes. Management believes the department store business and other retail businesses will continue to consolidate. The Company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of, and investments in, department stores and other complementary assets and companies. Acquisition transactions, if any, are expected to be financed from one or more of the following sources: cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under existing or new credit facilities and the issuance of long term debt, commercial paper or other securities, including common stock. 24 Critical Accounting Policies Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in, first out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, and is stated at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity. The retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins. Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. The Company receives certain allowances from various vendors in support of the merchandise it purchases for resale. The Company receives certain allowances as reimbursement for markdowns taken and or to support the gross margins earned in connection with the sales of merchandise. These allowances are generally credited to cost of sales at the time the merchandise is sold in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. The Company also receives advertising allowances from more than 900 of its merchandise vendors pursuant to cooperative advertising programs, with some vendors participating in multiple programs. These allowances represent reimbursements by vendors of costs incurred by the Company to promote the vendors merchandise and are netted against advertising and promotional costs when the related costs are incurred in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02 16. The arrangements pursuant to which the Companys vendors provide allowances, while binding, are generally informal in nature and one year or less in duration. The terms and conditions of these arrangements vary significantly from vendor to vendor and are influenced by, among other things, the type of merchandise to be supported. Although it is highly unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur, the Company could experience higher costs of sales and higher advertising expense, or reduce the amount of advertising that it uses, depending on the specific vendors involved and market conditions existing at the time. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, the Company has loss prevention programs and policies that are intended to minimize shrinkage. Physical inventories are taken within each merchandise department annually, and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges The carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed by the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. For long lived assets held for use, a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The estimate of cash flows includes managements assumptions of cash inflows and 25 outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations. When a potential impairment has occurred, an impairment write down is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long lived assets. If estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future, the Company may be required to record asset impairment write downs. For long lived assets held for disposal by sale, an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value less costs to sell. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. If the Company commits to a plan to dispose of a long lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, estimated cash flows are revised accordingly and the Company may be required to record an asset impairment write down. Additionally, related liabilities arise such as severance, contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets. The Company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded. The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment. The impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect to sales, gross margin and expense growth rates, and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge. The occurrence of an unexpected event or change in circumstances, such as adverse business conditions or other economic factors, would determine the need for impairment testing between annual impairment tests. The Company, through its insurance subsidiaries, is self insured for workers compensation and public liability claims up to certain maximum liability amounts. Although the amounts accrued are actuarially determined by third parties based on analysis of historical trends of losses, settlements, litigation costs and other factors, the amounts the Company will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts. Pension and Supplementary Retirement Plans The Company has a funded defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan) and an unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the SERP). The Company accounts for these plans using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), as amended by SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). Under SFAS 158, an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Under SFAS 87, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods. Pension expense calculated under SFAS 87 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted the measurement date provision of SFAS 158, which requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations to be the date of the Companys fiscal year end balance sheet. This required a change in the Companys measurement date, which was previously December 31. Funding requirements for the Pension Plan are determined by government regulations, not SFAS 87 or SFAS 158. No funding contributions were required, and the Company made no funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 26 2007. The Company made a $100 million voluntary funding contribution to the Pension Plan in 2006. The Company currently anticipates that it will not be required to make any additional contributions to the Pension Plan until January 2010, but may make voluntary funding contributions prior to that date based on the estimate of the Pension Plans expected funded status. As of the date of this report, the Company is considering making a voluntary funding contribution to the Pension Plan of approximately $175 million in December 2008. During 2006, Congress passed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) with the stated purpose of improving the funding of Americas private pension plans. The Act introduced new funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, introduces benefit limitations for certain under funded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions. The Act applies to pension plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. The Company has preliminarily reviewed the provisions of the Act to determine the impact on the Company. Required funding under the Act will be dependent upon many factors including the Pension Plans future funded status including any voluntary funding contributions the Company may choose to make and annual Pension Plan asset returns. Based upon this preliminary review as well as the current funded status of the Pension Plan relative to the Companys level of annual operating cash flows, the Company does not believe that required contributions under the Act would materially impact the Companys operating cash flows in any given year. At February 2, 2008, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of $276 million for the Pension Plan and $38 million for the SERP. These losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years in accordance with SFAS No. 87. The calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long term rate of return on plan assets (in the case of the Pension Plan), the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations and the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels. The Company has assumed that the Pension Plans assets will generate an annual long term rate of return of 8.75% since 2004. The Company develops its long term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long term asset class return expectations, as well as long term inflation assumptions. Pension expense increases or decreases as the expected rate of return on the assets of the Pension Plan decreases or increases, respectively. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on the Pension Plans assets by 0.25% (from 8.75% to 8.50%) would increase the estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $6 million and raising the expected long term rate of return on the Pension Plans assets by 0.25% (from 8.75% to 9.00%) would decrease the estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $6 million. The Company discounted its future pension obligations using a rate of 6.25% at February 2, 2008, compared to 5.85% at December 31, 2006. The Company determines the appropriate discount rate with reference to the current yield earned on an index of investment grade long term bonds and the impact of a yield curve analysis to account for the difference in duration between the long term bonds and the Pension Plans and SERPs estimated payments. Pension liability and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the discount rate is reduced or increased, respectively. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25% (from 6.25% to 6.0%) would increase the projected benefit obligation at February 2, 2008 by approximately $102 million and would increase estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $13 million. Increasing the discount rate by 0.25% (from 6.25% to 6.50%) would decrease the projected benefit obligation at February 2, 2008 by approximately $80 million and would decrease estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $6 million. 27 The assumed weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels was 5.4% at February 2, 2008 and December 31, 2006 for the Pension Plan, and 7.2% at February 2, 2008 and December 31, 2006 for the SERP. The Company develops its increase of future compensation level assumption based on recent experience. Pension liabilities and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels is increased or decreased, respectively. Increasing or decreasing the assumed weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels by 0.25% would increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation at February 2, 2008 by approximately $12 million and change estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $3 million. New Pronouncements Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155), which amended certain provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. The adoption of SFAS 155 has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted the measurement date provision of SFAS 158, which requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations to be the date of a companys fiscal year end. This required a change in the Companys measurement date, which was previously December 31. As a result, on February 4, 2007 the Company recorded a $7 million decrease to the beginning balance of accumulated equity, a $29 million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a $36 million decrease to other liabilities and a $14 million increase to deferred income taxes. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on February 4, 2007, and the adoption resulted in a net increase to accruals for uncertain tax positions of $1 million, an increase to the beginning balance of accumulated equity of $1 million and an increase to goodwill of $2 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition and disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 157 will require the fair value of an asset or liability to be calculated on a market based measure, which will reflect the credit risk of the company. SFAS 157 will also require expanded disclosure requirements, which will include the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and to interim periods within those fiscal years, for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entitys financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and to interim periods within those fiscal years, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities other than those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entitys financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial 28 assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this statement will affect any future acquisitions entered into by the Company, and beginning with fiscal 2009 the Company will no longer account for adjustments to tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits assumed in previous acquisitions as increases or decreases to goodwill. After adoption of SFAS 141R, such adjustments will be accounted for in income tax expense. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that may adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the Company manages exposures through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged financial instruments. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities, which are described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of the Companys borrowings are under fixed rate instruments. However, the Company, from time to time, may use interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to help manage its exposure to interest rate movements and reduce borrowing costs. At February 2, 2008, the Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments. On February 26, 2007, the Companys board of directors approved an additional $4,000 million authorization to the Companys existing share repurchase program. The Company used a portion of this authorization to effect the immediate repurchase of 45 million outstanding shares for an initial payment of approximately $2,000 million, subject to settlement provisions pursuant to the terms of two related accelerated share repurchase agreements, which included derivative financial instruments indexed to the Companys shares. Upon settlement of the accelerated share repurchase agreements in May and June of 2007, the Company received approximately 700,000 additional shares of its common stock, resulting in a total of approximately 45.7 million shares being repurchased. Based on the Companys lack of market risk sensitive instruments (primarily limited to variable rate debt) outstanding at February 2, 2008, the Company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of such date. 29
