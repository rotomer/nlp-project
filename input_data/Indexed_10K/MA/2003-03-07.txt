Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe)(together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, the words believe, expect, could, may, will and similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. Many factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control, influence whether any forward looking statements can or will be achieved. Any one of those factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any forward looking statements made by MasterCard or on its behalf. Below are the principal factors that we believe are important to our business, and that could cause actual results to differ from expectations. For a more complete discussion of these risk factors, see Item 1 Business herein for the discussion under the caption Risk Factors. the sustainability of our relationships with our customers and of our customers relationships with their cardholders and merchants; 25 Table of Contents substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry and consolidation in the payments industry; the threat of disintermediation from our customers as a result of the actions of certain competitors; global economic and political conditions; technological developments in the global payments industry; potential disruptions of our transaction processing systems by natural disaster or otherwise; potential breach of the security of our systems; risk of our customers settlement default and or non payment to merchants and of the continuing credit quality of our customers; the outcome or impact of antitrust claims by the U.S. Department of Justice; the outcome or impact of a class action lawsuit by U.S. merchants; the outcome or impact of litigation relating to our currency conversion practices; the outcome or impact of legal and regulatory proceedings in various jurisdictions relating to interchange fees; the outcome or impact of other regulatory initiatives, including those conducted by tax authorities; the outcome or impact of European Union regulations on cross border payments; risks associated with international operations; and currency fluctuations and foreign exchange risks. Results of Operations On June 28, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Europay International S.A. (EPI) not previously owned by MasterCard International. On July 16, 2002, EPI, as a wholly owned subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, was renamed MasterCard Europe S.A. On September 30, 2002, MasterCard Europe S.A. was reorganized in Belgium as MasterCard Europe. The results of MasterCard Europes operations have been included in our consolidated statements of income of the Company from June 28, 2002. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Revenue was $1.892 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.611 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $281 million or 17%, of which $143 million or 9% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Our revenue is comprised of operations fees and assessments. On January 1, 2002, we implemented Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products) (EITF 01 9) and reclassified as a reduction of revenue certain payments to customers and merchants that were previously recognized as advertising and market development expense. We anticipate that future revenue growth will be moderated by additional investments in our business. Operations fees represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement and other products and services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees are generally driven by transactions. The number of transactions processed increased to approximately 8.943 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to approximately 7.765 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of approximately 15%. The preceding figure reflects certain revisions to the previously reported number of transactions processed. Using the revised information, processed transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002 were 2.339 billion and 6.479 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2002, MasterCard branded transactions, including transactions not processed by the Company, increased to approximately 13.577 billion from approximately 11.731 billion in the prior year, an increase of approximately 16%. MasterCard Europe transactions are included in both 26 Table of Contents periods. Operations fees were $1.231 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.083 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $149 million or 14%. Approximately $69 million of operations fees in 2002 were due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Increases in operations fees were partially offset by a $9 million decline in warning bulletin revenue in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, exclusive of MasterCard Europes warning bulletin revenue. Operations fees were also offset by lower average pricing based on the Companys pricing structure, which rewards customers with lower prices for incremental volume, and a $13 million increase in rebates provided to customers in the year ended December 31, 2002 over the same period in 2001. Assessments predominantly represent payments made by members of MasterCard International in respect of their card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within the MasterCard family of brands, principally the MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus brands. Assessments were approximately $660 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of approximately $132 million or 25%. Approximately $75 million of our assessments in 2002 were due to our acquisition of MasterCard Europe. In addition, the increase in assessments was attributable to an increase in gross dollar volume (GDV) between the periods. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on MasterCard cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks. GDV growth in 2002 as compared to 2001 was approximately 15% when measured in local currency and approximately 16% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. GDV was $1.142 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. GDV includes MasterCard Europe activity in both periods presented. Offsetting the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased by $53 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 over the same period in 2001. A significant portion of the increase was related to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Operating expenses were $1.750 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.390 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $360 million or 26%. Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, depreciation and amortization expenses. Operating expenses increased $169 million due to our acquisition of MasterCard Europe. We expect to continue to invest significantly, primarily in advertising and marketing support over the next several years to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard and its customers. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition, promote brand acceptance, and to enhance the development of our programs and services. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful. We expect operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as a result of these initiatives. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, telecommunications, data processing, travel and professional fees. General and administrative expenses were $965 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $814 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $151 million or 19%. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs of $105 million resulting from increases in additional personnel, including the impact of the acquisition of MasterCard Europe, and salary increases in 2002. Approximately $78 million of general and administrative expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. General and administrative expenses include net foreign exchange losses of $2 million and $7 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. These net foreign exchange losses primarily result from forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we made significant investments in advertising and market development to build value in our brands and to develop programs to differentiate ourselves from our competition. Advertising and market development expenses were $694 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $506 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $188 million or 37%, primarily consisting of a $91 million increase in advertising expense, a $74 million increase in promotions and sponsorships expense, and a $23 million increase in marketing expense. Approximately $73 million of advertising and market development expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Our increased advertising and market development expenses were related to a number of key initiatives in 2002. MasterCard was a sponsor of the 2002 FIFA World Cup which required a significant amount of resources in 2002 for the sponsorship fee, special programming, promotions and event marketing. Other 27 Table of Contents significant sponsorships during 2002 included Major League Baseball and the Professional Golf Association. MasterCard also incurred increased advertising spending for special programming associated with the Grammy and Academy awards. In 2002, we significantly increased our investment in advertising and market support to increase brand recognition and promote brand acceptance. We plan to accelerate and increase the investment in advertising, as well as other programs and sponsorships in 2003 and for several years thereafter. Depreciation expense was $40 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. During 2001, certain assets were written off due to the move to our Winghaven technology center. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Accordingly, the Companys depreciation expense decreased in 2002. This decrease in depreciation was offset by approximately $7 million of depreciation expense that was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Amortization expense was $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by $11 million of amortization expense due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe as well as additional amortization of capitalized computer software. Other income (expense) was $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $5 million. Other income (expense) comprises primarily interest, dividend and other investment income related to the portfolio of investments held, as well as interest expense, minority interest and other expense. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $2 million of the increase in other income and expense. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased to 26.5% from 39.0 % for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several items, some of which are not expected to recur. In December 2002, the Belgium statutory tax rate was reduced from 40.2% to 34.0%. As a result, deferred income tax liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of MasterCard Europe were reduced based on the lower Belgian income tax rate. In addition, we anticipate settling certain tax examinations on a favorable basis. The effective tax rate was also decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income in the United States from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to those with lower rates. Furthermore, we realized significant foreign tax credits that we were previously unable to claim. The benefits of these items in lowering the effective tax rate were partially offset by a one time increase in state income tax expense attributable to lower deferred state tax assets as a result of lower state tax rates. As a result of the foregoing, our net income was $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $26 million or 18%. The net loss of $7 million resulting from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe contributed to the decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2002. The initiatives discussed above, which involve significant expenditures to support and build value in the MasterCard family of brands, could result in lower net income or slower net income growth over the next several years. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 Revenue was $1.611 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1.445 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $166 million or 12%. Our revenue is comprised of operations fees and assessments. Operations fees represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement and other products and services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees were $1.083 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $970 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $113 million or 12%. This increase was primarily attributable to the number of transactions processed by MasterCard. Operations fees were offset by lower average pricing based on the Companys pricing structure, which rewards customers with lower prices for incremental volume and a $27 million increase in rebates provided to customers in the year ended December 31, 2001 over the same period in 2000. During the same period, MasterCard branded transactions, including transactions not processed by the Company, increased to approximately 11.731 billion from approximately 9.994 billion, an increase of approximately 17%. 28 Table of Contents Assessments predominantly represent payments made by members of MasterCard International in respect of their card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within the MasterCard family of brands, principally MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus brands. Assessments were $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $475 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $53 million or 11%. The increase in assessments was attributable primarily to an increase in GDV between the periods. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on MasterCard cards for goods and services, including balance transfers and convenience checks. GDV growth in 2001 as compared to 2000 was approximately 18% when measured in local currency and approximately 14% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. Offsetting the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased $54 million in the year ended December 31, 2001 over the same period in 2000. While the events of September 11, 2001 did not have a significant impact on MasterCards total volume, they did impact the mix between domestic and international volumes experienced by MasterCard. International volume decreased dramatically in the weeks following September 11th, due to decreased international travel and related expenditures. However, this decrease was partially offset by higher domestic volume. Toward the end of the year, volumes began to recover, which helped drive the overall increase in revenue over the prior year. Operating expenses were $1.390 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1.267 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $122 million or 10%. Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, depreciation and amortization expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, telecommunications, data processing, travel and professional fees. General and administrative expenses were $814 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $737 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $77 million or 10%. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs resulting from increases in additional personnel and compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2001, MasterCard made significant investments in advertising and market development to support and build value in the MasterCard family of brands, and to develop new and distinct programs to differentiate ourselves from our competition. Advertising and market development expenses were $506 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $471 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $35 million or 7%. Our promotions and sponsorship fees increased between the periods primarily as a result of incremental promotions in the year ended December 31, 2001, such as the National Hockey League Celebrity Cup Face off, as well as increased contractual sponsorship fees associated with the FIFA World Cup, Copa America, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and PGA Golf organizations. These increases were partially offset by reductions in media expenditures between the periods in traditional television venues and the Internet. Depreciation expense was $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $5 million or 14%, primarily due to purchases of equipment in 2001. Amortization expense was $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of approximately $6 million or 23%. This increase was primarily the result of additional amortization of capitalized computer software, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of franchise rights in 2001 due to the write down of Mondex franchise rights in certain Asian countries to their estimated fair value in 2000. Other income (expense) was $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $11 million or 49%. Other income (expense) comprises primarily interest, dividend and other investment income related to the portfolio of investments held, as well as interest expense, minority interest and other expense. The decrease in other income (expense) was primarily the result of a devaluation of the trading securities portfolio. 29 Table of Contents The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased to 39.0% from 41.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The lower rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to the utilization for income tax purposes of a loss related to foreign operations, the apportionment of pre tax income to states with a lower tax rate and a larger amount of tax exempt interest income as a percentage of pre tax income than in the year ended December 31, 2000. As a result of the foregoing, our net income was $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $24 million or 20%. Liquidity and Capital Resources We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to cover any settlement risk, to finance our capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, and other contractual commitments. At December 31, 2002, we had $841 million of liquid investments with which to manage operations. We expect that the cash generated from operations, and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2003. In addition, we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million compared to $196 million and $260 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2002 was principally due to changes in settlement due to and from members. Our accrued expenses and accounts payable increased for the year ended December 31, 2002 due to increased spending for advertising and our focus on working capital management. Net cash used in investing activities was $112 million, $219 million and $322 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The outlay of cash in 2002 was primarily due to capital expenditures, expenditures for capitalized software, and purchases of investment securities available for sale. Capital expenditures were predominantly associated with investments in data center equipment. Investment securities available for sale increased as a result of investments made with excess funds. Those uses were offset by $31 million of cash received, net of acquisition related expenses, from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe during the second quarter of 2002. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $(35) million, $5 million and $(6) million, respectively. In all years, financing activities relate to (repayments) advances of MasterCards net settlement overdraft positions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Our financial position continues to reflect strong liquidity. Working capital, consisting of current assets less current liabilities, was $526 million at December 31, 2002 and $468 million at December 31, 2001, representing a working capital ratio of 1.6 and 1.7 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition to our liquid investments, we provide for liquidity through a 364 day revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with certain financial institutions that expires on June 3, 2003. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, MasterCard has commitments of $1.2 billion that can be borrowed in the form of revolving loans. Interest is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 28 basis points, and the rate increases depending upon the amount of any draw down. Under the Credit Facility, MasterCard has agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7 basis points per annum on each lenders commitment. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 30 Table of Contents We have entered into contractual commitments associated with operating lease agreements for office space and equipment as well as for sponsorship, licensing and other agreements. Obligations relating to these contractual commitments are estimated to be payable in the following periods: Sponsorship, Operating Licensing & Total Leases Other (In thousands) 2003 $ 197,514 $ 39,712 $ 157,802 2004 159,651 26,633 133,018 2005 133,221 21,898 111,323 2006 90,151 18,852 71,299 2007 36,224 16,577 19,647 Thereafter 26,577 21,103 5,474 Total $ 643,338 $ 144,775 $ 498,563 In the normal course of business, MasterCard operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions among its members. Net settlements are generally cleared daily among members by wire transfer or other bank clearing means, via settlement cash accounts. However, some transactions may not settle until subsequent business days due to varying local currency settlement value date intervals and other timing differences. These timing differences result in amounts from members or amounts due to members for a duration normally ranging from one to four calendar days and are included in the balance sheet of MasterCard as settlement due to/due from members. The net impact of the settled transactions was the main contributor to the net settlement cash account overdraft position of $10 million at December 31, 2001, which was recorded in other current liabilities. No overdraft positions existed at December 31, 2002. Primarily due to uncertainty surrounding lawsuits, in particular the merchant antitrust litigation described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, on June 17, 2002 Standard & Poors placed MasterCard on negative outlook. However, Standard & Poors reaffirmed MasterCards credit rating on September 4, 2002. The adverse outcome of certain of the legal proceedings described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein could have a detrimental impact on liquidity and capital resources if they result in adverse awards of damages to the relevant plaintiffs. Overall, we believe our cash provided by operating activities, our liquid investments and the Credit Facility provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing business requirements. Economic Fluctuations Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe our operations have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have utilized technology and operating efficiencies to offset increased operating expenses. In addition, a portion of our revenues is based upon a percentage of GDV, which partially insulates operating margins on these revenues from the effects of inflation. Portions of our business can be seasonal. Revenue is generally favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period. Member Relationships and Related Parties We have a diversified member base of approximately 2,300 principal members and approximately 23,000 affiliate members. Our stockholders are all principal members of MasterCard International. In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of MasterCard International. These members do not 31 Table of Contents constitute related parties pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 57 Related Party Disclosures. Certain of our members generate in excess of five percent of our revenue. The loss of any of these members could adversely impact MasterCards net income. In addition, as part of our business initiative to increase our share, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with members. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to permit members in the United States that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the current antitrust litigation being brought against us by the U.S. Department of Justice. Any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. However, we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition. Our accounting policies are described in detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgment. Revenue Recognition Certain revenues are estimated based upon transactional information accumulated from our systems and using historical performance. We have business agreements with certain members that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain hurdles. Such rebates are generally calculated on a monthly basis based upon the estimated customers performance and the contracted discount rates for the services provided, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned. In addition, we enter into agreements with certain customers to provide volume based and support incentives that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products) (EITF 01 9). Incentives are based on managements estimate of the customers performance in a given period. Our estimate of customers performance is a critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, discussions with our customers and transactional information accumulated from our systems. The estimated performance is used to calculate the rebates and incentives based upon the related customer agreements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is capitalized in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Statement of Position 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use and related guidance. Development costs are expensed during the preliminary project management phase until it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Thereafter, all qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the 32 Table of Contents design, development and testing phase are capitalized, and upon the project being substantially complete and ready for its intended use, are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years. Costs related to post implementation activities for software that is developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred. We are required to make judgments to determine the feasibility of the project for its intended use and the phase of the projects. In addition, we estimate the internal costs based on hours spent on the design, development and testing phases of the project. These judgments and estimates impact the accounting for capitalized software in our financial statements. Impairment We test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and test property, plant and equipment for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We test equity investments for a loss in value, which is other than temporary, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Whenever indicators of impairment exist, these assets are tested. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually. Our test for impairment requires management to make assumptions regarding the expected net future cash flows of each asset. These assumptions are based on our internal forecasts. If the sum of expected net future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows or other methodologies. Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our balance sheet. Therefore, an impairment could result in a material reduction of our assets, as well as our net income. Litigation Accrual We are a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue legal costs that are expected to be incurred to defend MasterCard relating to certain litigation. The accrual is estimated based on managements expectations of foreseeable costs as determined in consultation with outside counsel. Our policy has been applied since the commencement of certain litigation. Changes in the estimated amount or timing of legal costs can significantly impact our results of operations. Outside of foreseeable legal costs, we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings will have in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows and, as such, consistent with SFAS No. 5, no accrual has been made. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141). SFAS 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 16, Business Combinations and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 specifies criteria for the recognition of certain intangible assets apart from goodwill. The acquisition of EPI, as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, was accounted for in accordance with SFAS 141. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 142 supersedes APB No. 17, Intangible Assets and 33 Table of Contents primarily addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized and must be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 further requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed periodically for impairment. The Statement requires that transitional goodwill (goodwill recorded before the adoption of SFAS No. 142) be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of SFAS 142. Accordingly, MasterCard tested the goodwill on its books prior to the acquisition of EPI and no impairment was required. The goodwill and intangible assets that resulted from the acquisition of EPI was accounted for in accordance with SFAS 142. The Company evaluated goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the EPI acquisition as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2002, as part of its annual impairment analysis. The adoption of SFAS 142 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. SFAS 144 also supersedes certain aspects of APB No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred (rather than as of the measurement date as required by APB No. 30). The Company adopted SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In February 2002, the EITF finalized Issue No. 01 9 Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products). EITF 01 9 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and provides guidance on the income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a customer in connection with the customers purchase of the vendors products or to promote sales of the vendors products. On January 1, 2002, MasterCard implemented EITF 01 9 which resulted in certain payments to customers and merchants previously classified as advertising and market development expense being reclassified as a reduction of revenue. The amounts of such consideration were $167 million and $127 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Incentives are based on managements estimate of the customers performance as detailed in the agreements in a given period and actual results may differ from these estimates. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes EITF Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs associated with exit or disposal activities for entities newly acquired in a business combination are not within the scope of SFAS 146. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company early adopted SFAS 146 on July 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the EITF concluded on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, (EITF 00 21). EITF 00 21 addresses how to determine when a revenue arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and, if separation is appropriate, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units. The provisions of EITF 00 21 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. MasterCard is in the process of determining the impact, if any, of adopting this accounting pronouncement. 34 Table of Contents In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that upon the issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee. FIN 45s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantors fiscal year end. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after December 15, 2002. MasterCard has complied with the disclosure requirements and is in the process of determining the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions for initial recognition and measurement for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 clarifies that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 is applicable in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The impact of consolidating the special purpose entity is discussed in detail in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in both interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of board of director approved policies governing our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial instruments and we monitor aggregate risk exposures on an ongoing basis. We enter into forward currency contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. This activity minimizes our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and euro. As a result of the acquisition of MasterCard Europe, MasterCards market risk exposures at December 31, 2002 are greater than December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, forward currency contracts against the dollar were both sold (with notional amounts of $25 million and $3 million, respectively) and purchased (with notional amounts of $39 million and $11 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2002 and 2001 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $1.3 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002, due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe, forward currency contracts against the euro were both sold (with notional amounts of $8 million) and purchased (with notional amounts of $199 million). A hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $17 million at December 31, 2002. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 12 months and are utilized to manage anticipated cash flows in major overseas markets for the subsequent year. Our settlement activities may be subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rate for financial transactions and the clearing of settlement positions is typically one business day and is limited to seventeen stable transaction currencies. The remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in U.S. dollars or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Our interest sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as investments. They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium term notes. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 35 Table of Contents 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $15 million and $14 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities held in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $3 million and $4 million for December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These securities are part of a deferred executive compensation plan. Therefore, an offsetting gain of $2 million and $3 million for December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, would be recorded in general and administrative expense. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement.
