Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe)(together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, the words believe, expect, could, may, will and similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. Many factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control, influence whether any forward looking statements can or will be achieved. Any one of those factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any forward looking statements made by MasterCard or on its behalf. We believe there are certain risk factors 24 Table of Contents that are important to our business, and that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Please see a complete discussion of these risk factors under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1 Business of the Form 10 K. Overview Our revenues continued to grow, in spite of the weakened economy in the first half of 2003 coupled with decreased travel as a result of SARS and the conflict in the Middle East. In certain markets, we are seeing positive results from the expansion of our advertising and marketing support initiatives. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition, promote brand acceptance, and enhance the development of our programs and services. In 2003, revenues increased by 18% of which 9% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe and 2% was due to the weakening of the dollar against the euro creating a favorable currency translation. Our operating expenses grew by 62% in 2003, of which 44% was due to the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, 10% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe and 1% was due to the weakening of the dollar against the euro creating an unfavorable currency translation. The global payments industry is highly competitive. We are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants, to support our programs and services. Most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers. Currently the payments industry is undergoing significant consolidations and the merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues. Our financial results have been significantly influenced by the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate our business. During the current year, we settled the U.S. merchant lawsuit and contract disputes with certain customers, resulting in a pre tax charge of $763 million. We decided not to assess our members for these settlements and plan on funding the settlement costs from operations as payments are due. Due to the nature of our business, we believe the legal and regulatory environment will remain a challenge in the coming year, and we expect to devote a considerable amount of time and resources to addressing it. Legal and Regulatory Impact on our Business We earn a portion of our revenues in connection with MasterCard branded offline debit cards in the United States. Following the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, Visa U.S.A., Inc. implemented a bylaw requiring Visas 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the United States to pay a fee if they reduce their debit volume by more than 10%. If Visa is permitted to enforce this bylaw, it would penalize Visa members seeking to do debit business with MasterCard and effectively prevent them from converting their debit cards to the MasterCard brand. MasterCard has challenged the validity of this bylaw provision as described more fully in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, under the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit, merchants will have the right to reject MasterCard branded debit cards in the United States, while still accepting other MasterCard branded cards and vice versa. Either of these scenarios would be detrimental to MasterCards ability to maintain and grow its debit card business in the United States. We establish multilateral interchange fees on behalf of certain customers. While we do not receive or record interchange fees as revenue, the impact of the global interchange proceedings described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein could impact our customers use of card programs carrying our brands, thereby negatively impacting our future revenues. Results of Operations Key selected financial and operating data for the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is included in the table below. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe (formerly Europay International S.A. (EPI)), on June 28, 2002, affected the comparability of our financial data. The results of MasterCard Europes operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from June 28, 2002; however, MasterCard Europes gross dollar volume and transactions are included in all periods. 25 Table of Contents Percent Change 2003 vs. 2002 vs. 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 (In millions, except per share amounts) Operations fees $ 1,431 $ 1,232 $ 1,083 16.2 % 13.8 % Assessments 800 660 528 21.2 % 25.0 % Revenue 2,231 1,892 1,611 17.9 % 17.4 % General and administrative 1,099 965 814 13.9 % 18.6 % Advertising and market development 851 694 506 22.6 % 37.2 % U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 763 ** ** Depreciation and amortization 120 91 70 31.9 % 30.0 % Total operating expenses 2,833 1,750 1,390 61.9 % 25.9 % Operating income (loss) (602 ) 142 221 (523.9 )% (35.7 )% Total other income (expense) (10 ) 16 12 (162.5 )% 33.3 % Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change (612 ) 158 233 (487.3 )% (32.2 )% Income tax expense (benefit) (221 ) 42 91 (626.2 )% (53.8 )% Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax 5 ** ** Net income (loss) $ (386 ) $ 116 $ 142 (432.8 )% (18.3 )% Net income (loss) per share (basic and diluted) $ (3.86 ) $ 1.35 $ 1.98 (385.9 )% (31.8 )% Weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted) 100 86 72 16.3 % 19.4 % Gross dollar volume (in billions) 1,272.0 1,151.9 985.9 10.4 % 16.8 % Processed transactions 9,656.2 8,944.7 7,766.1 8.0 % 15.2 % ** Not meaningful Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar except for MasterCard Europe, whose functional currency is the euro, therefore our results of operations have been impacted by movements of the euro against the U.S. dollar. As the euro strengthened against the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2003, MasterCard Europes revenue and expenses increased as a result of translation into U.S. dollar amounts. In addition, we assess our members based on the U.S. dollar volume of their card programs. Since the U.S. dollar devalued against most major currencies in 2003, our revenues increased accordingly. However, it is not practical to estimate the impact of the U.S. dollar devaluation on our assessment revenue. Revenues Our revenues are generated from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services, and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands. We establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer transactions on a global basis. We do not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on MasterCard branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for determining these and most other competitive card features. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information, historical and projected customer performance. The U.S. market remains our largest geographic market. Revenue generated in the U.S. accounted for approximately 63% and 61% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No other country accounted for more than 5% of the Companys revenue in 2003 and 2002. 26 Table of Contents Operations Fees Operations fees primarily represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement and other payment services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees increased $199 million or 16% in 2003 and $149 million or 14% in 2002 from the prior year. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $111 million or 56% and $69 million or 46% of the increase in operations fees in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The significant changes in operations fees were as follows: Dollar Change Increase (Decrease) 2003 2002 (In millions) Authorization and settlement $ 156 $ 118 Currency conversion 30 39 Excessive chargebacks 15 Acceptance development fees 9 12 Warning bulletins 4 4 Internet payments 3 3 Incentives and rebates (9 ) (13 ) Other (9 ) (14 ) $ 199 $ 149 Authorization and settlement revenues increased $156 million, or 29%, in 2003 and $118 million, or 27% in 2002. These revenues are driven by the number of transactions processed through our systems, and the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. A portion of settlement revenues is generated from foreign currency rate movements in the settlement process. We anticipate that the migration of Switch brand in the United Kingdom to our Maestro brand will increase the number of transactions processed and accordingly, operations fees in 2004. Currency conversion revenues increased $30 million in 2003 and $39 million in 2002, principally due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. These revenues are the result of cross border transactions by cardholders which require currency conversion to settle transactions between issuers and acquirers. These revenues fluctuate with cross border travel and are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While the conflict in Iraq, threat of terrorism and outbreak of SARS negatively impacted cross border travel in the beginning of 2003, travel increased significantly in the latter part of the year. We also benefited from favorable currency fluctuations. In 2002, the increase in currency conversion revenues was principally due to the recovery of the U.S. market from decreased travel and related expenditures that resulted in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. 27 Table of Contents Excessive chargeback fees are applied to acquirers that acquire transactions from merchants that experience a high level of disputed claims from their customers. During 2003 and 2002, customers were assessed fees of $25 million and $10 million, respectively, for excessive chargebacks in accordance with MasterCard rules. Acceptance development fees assessed to members to promote supermarket and warehouse clubs increased $5 million and $6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Fees to promote acceptance at the point of sale increased $4 million and $6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Fees for warning bulletins, which are listings of restricted cards, increased $4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Exclusive of MasterCard Europe, warning bulletin fees decreased $3 million and $9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline primarily relates to Brazil and Argentina issuers of MasterCard branded cards shifting from paper restricted card listings to lower priced electronic card listings. Processing payments over the Internet for financial institutions in the United States is a natural extension of our business and our revenues from this activity are increasing with the growing use of the Internet. The increase was $3 million in these revenues in 2003 and 2002. We intend to continue to pursue this opportunity for revenue growth. Our pricing structure rewards customers with lower prices in exchange for certain volume, share and other commitments. Core revenue growth rates are affected by the consolidation of our customers, competition in our industry and continued organic growth in transactions and volumes. Since we offer tiered pricing for our services, as our customers merge and grow they are moving into lower relative pricing for the same level of services. In addition to the tiered pricing, incentives and rebates are provided to certain customers. Incentives and rebates increased $9 million in 2003 and $13 million in 2002. Assessments Assessments are based on our customers gross dollar volume (GDV) of MasterCard transactions. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on MasterCard branded cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks. In 2003 and 2002, assessment revenue growth was $140 million, or 21% and $132 million, or 25%, respectively. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $94 million or 68% and $75 million or 57% of the increase in assessments in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding MasterCard Europe, assessment revenues grew 8% in 2003 and 11% in 2002. GDV growth, including MasterCard Europe, when measured in local currency was 6% and 16% in 2003 and 2002, respectively and 10% and 17%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. Moderating the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased by $72 million and $53 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. These rebates and incentives generally are based on card generated volume as well as a fixed component for marketing support for the launch of new programs. As volumes increase, the rebates and incentives also increase. Additionally, the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed to the addition of new member contracts, particularly in MasterCard Europe, which adopted the practice of offering rebates and incentives after the Integration. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2003, there was an increase in operating expenses of $1.1 billion or 62%, of which $763 million or 44% was a result of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and $197 million or 11% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. In 2002, there was an increase in operating expenses of $360 million or 26%, of which $169 million or 12% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. 28 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications and travel. In 2003 and 2002, these activities accounted for approximately 39% and 55% of operating expenses, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $134 million in 2003 and $151 million in 2002, primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $110 million, or 82%, and $78 million, or 52%, of the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Personnel expenses in 2003 increased due to a full year of salaries and benefits as compared to six months in 2002 as a result of headcount increases from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. In addition: Severance expense increased $20 million primarily as a result of a program we undertook in 2003 to achieve greater efficiencies and reduce costs, including employee reductions. These efforts will continue to ensure that our organization is strategically aligned to meet the needs of our customers, focus on core strategic activities and best position us to deliver solid financial results. Certain executive compensation expense increased $12 million due to the net appreciation on the portfolio of securities that the Company purchased to support an executive incentive plan, which is fully offset in other income. Pension expense increased $4 million as detailed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Bonuses decreased $19 million in 2003 due to the overall performance of the Company against objectives. In 2002, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs due to the increase in headcount resulting from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe and salary increases. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising and marketing, and promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals. In 2003 and 2002, these activities accounted for approximately 30% and 40% of operating expenses, respectively. Advertising and market development expenses increased $157 million or 23% in 2003 and $188 million or 37% in 2002. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $70 million or 45% and $73 million or 39% of the increase in advertising and market development expenses in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our advertising and market development expenses increased as a result of a number of key initiatives in 2003 and 2002. The major advertising and market development activities increased as follows: Advertising and marketing expenses increased $107 million and $114 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our Priceless campaign continues to be successful and effective in 96 countries and 47 languages; therefore we continue to invest significantly in this campaign. Promotions increased $36 million in 2003 and $24 million in 2002, respectively. Promotions are run to assist our customers in generating sales i) during particular times of the year such as the summer or holiday seasons ii) for specific payment products such as debit or iii) in specific shopping venues. Sponsorships increased $14 million and $50 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. MasterCard is a sponsor of the World Cup, which culminated in 2002; therefore in 2002, significant resources were spent on the sponsorship fee, special programming, promotions and event marketing. In 2003, the increase in sponsorships was offset by a $12 million decrease for amounts spent on the World Cup in 2002. During 2003, we became a sponsor of the UEFA Champions League and certain NFL teams. Other significant sponsorships in both years include Major League Baseball, the Professional Golf Association and Universal Studios. 29 Table of Contents The MasterCard family of brands, principally MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, are valuable strategic assets which convey a symbol that can be readily identified by our customers, as well as our customers customers, which create value for our business. Our advertising and marketing efforts are focused on ensuring that our services are identified, communicated and marketed in a clear, efficient and consistent manner, not only on a local level, but also on a global scale. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brand reputation and image. In 2002, MasterCard implemented a four year plan to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard and its customers by significantly expanding its spending in advertising and market development. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we spent $152 million and $87 million, respectively, on advertising and marketing relating to this plan. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition, promote brand acceptance, and enhance the development of our programs and services in certain markets. We will continue to evaluate the extent of these initiatives in light of changing market conditions. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements For the year ended December 31, 2003, the total pre tax charge recorded for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements was $763 million. The primary components of this charge were (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant settlement, and (iii) costs to address certain merchants who opted not to participate in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. In addition, in 2003, MasterCard settled contract disputes with certain customers and incurred additional costs in connection with the conclusion of certain litigation discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Certain of these amounts are estimates. The Company will evaluate these estimates if circumstances change and, if necessary, make refinements. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $29 million in 2003 and $21 million in 2002. Depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly between the periods due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe as well as additional capitalized computer software. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $17 million or 59% and $18 million or 86% of the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions. This technology is continuously updated and improved. Therefore, our investment in capitalized software and related amortization also continues to increase. In recent years we have made the following significant changes to our technology and technology centers which have caused an increase in our depreciation and amortization: During 2003, our co processing technology center was moved from Lake Success, NY to Kansas City, MO. The cost of the new facility and equipment was $36 million. During 2003, we continued to invest in our System Enhancement Strategy, an upgrade of all of MasterCards core systems to improve productivity and lower overall processing costs. During 2002 assets were acquired for our new Winghaven technology center. Other Income and Expense Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income and interest expense. Investment income increased $31 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002. The increase in 2003 is primarily due to the consolidation of the variable interest entity (see the discussion in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein) and appreciation of the market value of our trading securities portfolio. Interest expense increased $53 million in 2003 primarily due to $43 million of imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement obligation and the consolidation of the variable interest entity. Interest expense was $10 million in 2002 and 2001. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax (benefit) rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was (36.1)% versus an effective income tax rate of 26.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The 2003 tax benefit is primarily driven by the merchant lawsuit settlement. The 2002 rate was primarily attributable to a one time revaluation of the 2002 MasterCard Europe deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the Belgium statutory tax rate from 40.2% to 34.0% in December 2002. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased to 26.5% from 39.0% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several items, some of which are not expected to recur. In December 2002, the Belgium statutory tax rate was reduced from 40.2% to 34.0%. As a result, deferred income tax liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of MasterCard Europe were reduced based on the lower Belgian income tax rate. The effective tax rate was also decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income in the United States from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to those with lower rates. Furthermore, we realized significant foreign tax credits that we were previously unable to claim. The benefits of these items in lowering the effective tax rate were partially offset by a one time increase in state income tax expense attributable to lower deferred state tax assets as a result of lower state tax rates. Change in Accounting Principle Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed its method of calculating the market related value of plan assets used in determining the expected return on asset component of its annual pension cost. Under the previous method, 80 percent of the gains and losses on plan assets were deferred and recognized in the calculated market related value over the following four years. Under the new method, the market related value equals the current fair value of the plan assets. The new method is considered preferable because annual pension expense will reflect changes in the market performance of plan assets on a more timely basis. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46) and consolidated a variable interest entity on its consolidated balance sheet. The consolidation resulted in recording a held to maturity municipal bond, long term debt and minority interest. Liquidity We believe our ability to generate cash from our business to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2003, we had $880 million of liquid investments with which to manage operations compared to $841 million at December 31, 2002. We expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2004. In addition, we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2004. 31 Table of Contents Percent Change 2003 vs. 2002 vs. 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 (In millions, except ratio) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 190 $ 310 $ 196 (38.7 )% 58.2 % Net cash used in investing activities (162 ) (116 ) (219 ) 39.7 % (47.0 )% Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (35 ) 5 ** (800.0 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 1,610 $ 1,456 $ 1,118 10.6 % 30.2 % Current liabilities 1,189 930 650 27.8 % 43.1 % Long term liabilities 1,009 307 230 228.7 % 33.5 % Equity 699 1,023 607 (31.7 )% 68.5 % Working capital ratio 1.35 1.57 1.72 (14.0 )% (8.7 )% ** Not meaningful Cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was generated principally by current period earnings exclusive of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and legal settlements. We recorded expense of $763 million for legal settlement costs in 2003, of which related cash payments totaled $134 million. In 2002, cash provided by operating activities was principally due to changes in settlement due to and from members and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of higher advertising spending and our focus on working capital management. The utilization of cash by investing activities in 2003 was primarily due to the purchase of property, plant, equipment and capitalized software. The primary capital expenditure was the purchase of a building in Kansas City, Missouri for a co processing center. See discussion in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our members through a proprietary, global computer and telecommunications system. In 2002, our outlay of cash was primarily due to purchases of data center equipment, capitalized software and investment securities available for sale, offset by $31 million of cash received, net of acquisition related expenses, from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe during the second quarter of 2002. In 2002 financing activities relate to repayments of MasterCards net settlement overdraft positions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, we recorded liabilities in connection with certain legal settlements. We believe that we will be able to fund amounts payable in connection with these legal settlements through existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity. Due to Standard & Poors assessment of MasterCards vulnerability to legal risk, on May 16, 2003, Standard & Poors lowered MasterCards counterparty credit rating to A / A 2, subordinated debt rating to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on negative outlook. We do not believe this rating action will materially impact our liquidity. In addition to our liquid investments, we provide for liquidity through a committed $1.2 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with certain financial institutions which expires on June 18, 2004. The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard members. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 28 basis points. An additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate borrowings exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment. MasterCard was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 32 Table of Contents 2003. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2003. The lenders under the Credit Facility are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. Future Obligations The following table summarizes as of December 31, 2003, our obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances.

Our largest capital lease is for our Kansas City co processing facility. (b) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. (c) These amounts primarily relate to alliances we have with certain organizations in an attempt to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include purchase obligations. (d) These amounts are due in accordance with legal settlements entered into during 2003. These settlements are further explained in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. (e) Included in debt are amounts owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and secured notes due September 2009 . We also have various credit facilities which were not in use at December 31, 2003, that would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures of our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we needed the credit facilities to settle on the members behalf. Our debt is further explained in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Member Relationships and Related Parties We have a diversified member base of 2,600 principal members and 22,300 affiliate members. Our stockholders are all principal members of MasterCard International. In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of MasterCard International. These members do not constitute related parties pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 57 Related Party Disclosures. Certain of our members generate in excess of five percent of our revenue. The loss of any of these members could adversely impact MasterCards net income. In addition, as part of our business initiative to increase our share, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with members. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to permit members in the United States that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those 33 Table of Contents agreements without penalty as a result of the current antitrust litigation being brought against us by the U.S. Department of Justice. Any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. However, we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Revenue Recognition The Companys revenue is comprised principally of operations fees and assessments. Generally revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or self reported by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information, historical and projected customer performance. We have business agreements with certain customers that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain hurdles. Such rebates are generally calculated on a monthly basis based upon the estimated customers performance and the contracted discount rates for the services provided, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned. In addition, we enter into agreements with certain customers to provide volume based and support incentives that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products). Incentives are based on managements estimate of the customers performance in a given period. Our estimate of customers performance is a critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives. Rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimates of customer performance and the terms in the related customer agreements. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, discussions with our customers and transactional information accumulated from our systems. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 3 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. We accrued legal costs that are expected to be incurred to defend MasterCard relating to certain litigation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5. The accrual was estimated based upon managements expectations of foreseeable costs as determined in consultation with outside counsel. Changes in the estimated amount of accrued legal costs can significantly impact our results of operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may not reflect the actual outcomes. 34 Table of Contents Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement to be 8%. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A 1% increase in the discount rate would decrease the amount we recorded as an after tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 by approximately $20 million, and increase annual interest expense by approximately $4.2 million, $4.0 million, and $3.8 million in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a 1% decrease in the discount rate. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses. In accordance with SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 we stopped amortizing goodwill. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized, under the straight line method over the related useful life of 20 years. Principally all of our goodwill relates to the Integration of MasterCard Europe. On an annual basis, we will evaluate whether an impairment of the goodwill may exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of carrying amount over fair value. In conducting our impairment analyses, we utilized independent valuation experts to perform the analyses and tests of our goodwill. The test methods employed involved assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed were based on managements judgment using internal and external data. Based on our testing, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs, franchise rights, trademarks, tradenames and other intangible assets, which have finite lives, and customer relationships, which have indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives under the straight line method. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) requires intangible assets with finite lives to be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The primary component of our definite lived assets is our capitalized software. Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Statement of Position 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use and related guidance. Development costs are expensed during the preliminary project management phase until it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Thereafter, all qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the design, development and testing phase are capitalized, and upon the project being substantially complete and ready for its intended use, are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years. Costs related to post implementation activities for software that is developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use and the phase of each project. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. These judgments and estimates impact the accounting for capitalized software in our consolidated financial statements. During the year, we discontinued the use of various technologies and as such, we performed an impairment analysis on the related technologies and 35 Table of Contents concluded that the carrying value of these assets was in excess of fair value. Fair value was estimated as zero due to discontinued future use and an impairment charge was recorded. SFAS 142 also requires intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested for impairment at least annually. We consider our customer relationships to be an indefinite lived intangible asset and, as such, test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. We utilized independent valuation experts to assist us in determining the fair value of our customer relationships during 2003. Based on our testing, we concluded that our customer relationships were not impaired. Pensions Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual pension costs and the disclosure of the funded position of our pension plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans projected benefit obligation and the expected rate of return on plan assets. We utilized a discount rate of 6.25 percent in measuring the pension projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2003, 6.75 percent in calculating the 2003 expense and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation by $2 million, and would increase our annual pension expense by $0.3 million. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.3 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21). EITF 00 21 addresses how to determine when a revenue arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and, if separation is appropriate, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units. The provisions of EITF 00 21 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company may enter into contracts with its customers that provide for free or discounted services that are required to be separately identified under EITF 00 21. The discount from the fair value of the services is recorded as a reduction of revenue related to other elements of the contract. The Company adopted EITF 00 21 on July 1, 2003 and the impact of adopting this accounting pronouncement was negligible. In January 2003, FIN 46 was issued and in December 2003, FIN 46 was revised. FIN 46 clarifies that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after January 31, 2003. The Company adopted FIN 46 on January 1, 2003. The impact of consolidating the variable interest entity is discussed in detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The revised provisions of FIN 46 will be effective in the first quarter of 2004. Our adoption of the revisions to FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104), which supercedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101). The primary purpose of SAB 104 is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the SECs Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (the FAQ) issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. Selected portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, and a 36 Table of Contents revision of FASB Statement No. 132 (FAS 132). This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by FASB Statements No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company has adopted those aspects of SFAS 132 which are required for fiscal year ended 2003 and will fully implement the revised standard in fiscal year ending 2004. In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 1). FSP 106 1 permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Without FSP 106 1, plan sponsors would be required under SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to account for the effects of the Act in the fiscal period that includes December 8, 2003, the date the President of the United States signed the Act into law. If deferral is elected, the deferral must remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the issuance of guidance by the FASB on how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan sponsors under the Act or (b) the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations subsequent to January 31, 2004. MasterCard made the one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the Act until guidance is issued by FASB and will determine the impact, if any, that the Act will have on the financial position and results of operations of the Company. In November 2003, the EITF reached a partial consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 01). EITF 03 01 addresses determining the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115), and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method. Although the EITF requested further revisions to the underlying impairment models, the EITF reached a consensus that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under SFAS 115 that are below cost at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized. The consensus on quantitative and qualitative disclosures is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of EITF 03 01 for fiscal year ended 2003. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the Board of Directors, governing our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor aggregate risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2003 as compared to December 31, 2002. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. 37 Table of Contents At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $64 million and $39 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $60 million and $25 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2003 and 2002 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $0.4 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, forward currency contracts against the euro were both purchased (with notional amounts of $178 million and $199 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $8 million at December 31, 2002). There were no forward currency contracts sold against the euro at December 31, 2003. Based on the year end 2003 and 2002 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $16 million and $17 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our settlement activities may be subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to USD or one of seventeen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 144 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium term notes. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $17 million and $15 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our held to maturity investments are considered non trading securities and would not be subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of $12 million and $13 million for December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively under these credit facilities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Since these securities are part of a deferred executive compensation plan and to the extent the plan remains in a net appreciation position; an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. 38 Table of Contents
