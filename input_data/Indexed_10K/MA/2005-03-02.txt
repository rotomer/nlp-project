Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe)(together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Forward Looking Statements This Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, the words believe, expect, could, may, will and similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. Many factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control, influence whether any forward looking statements can or will be achieved. Any one of those factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any forward looking statements made by MasterCard or on its behalf. We believe there are certain risk factors that are important to our business, and that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Please see a complete discussion of these risk factors under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1 Business of this Report. Overview Our corporate strategy has been to focus on our key customers to drive our business growth; to strengthen our brands, technology and acceptance network; and to differentiate MasterCard from our competition by developing innovative payment solutions and customized consulting services. We remain committed to this strategic direction and have begun to implement initiatives to expand our customer focused approach to a broader group of customers, as well as to further develop relationships with merchants that accept our cards. We will also seek to leverage our expertise in payment programs, consulting services, brand marketing, technology and processing to expand the value added services we provide our customers. We also intend to proactively address the legal, regulatory and other industry risks that impact our business. In a challenging operating environment with legal, economic and industry pressures, we were able to exceed our planned revenue growth and attain our expense objectives in 2004. We achieved double digit revenue growth of 14% in 2004 from the comparable period in 2003, adjusted for a 2% impact of favorable foreign currency fluctuation against the euro. The increase in revenue was due to higher gross dollar volume (GDV) and more transactions processed by MasterCard, primarily from the expansion of our customer relationships, economic recovery in many countries and higher cross border travel. In 2003, our revenues were negatively impacted by the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak, reduced travel and a general economic slowdown worldwide. During 2004, we continued to realign our operations and limit the growth of our operating expenses through successful vendor negotiations. Our operating expenses increased 7% in 2004, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, of which 1% was due to the impact of acquisitions during 2004. In 2004, the translation of MasterCard Europes operating results from euro into U.S. dollar combined with the devaluation of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro resulted in a 2% increase in both revenues and operating expenses compared to 2003. We reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of 23 Table of Contents total revenues to 86% from 93% in 2003, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements. Our financial position reflects strong liquidity. We have $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities and $975 million in stockholders equity as of December 31, 2004. We intend to continue to focus on building our financial position. We believe our cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2005. We successfully completed our Sarbanes Oxley 404 testing one year ahead of the required deadline for non accelerated filers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated financial statements herein include a report from management which concludes that, based on our assessment, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2004.

(EPI)), on June 28, 2002, affected the comparability of our financial data. The results of MasterCard Europes operations have 24 Table of Contents been included in our consolidated statements of operations from June 28, 2002. However, MasterCard Europes GDV and transactions are included in all periods. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Quarterly assessment fees are calculated based on local dollar volume which is converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the quarter. In 2004, the increase in GDV of 14% on a U.S. dollar converted basis exceeded local GDV growth of 11%, resulting in increased assessment revenues due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. In addition, consumer behavior, particularly international travel and purchases, varies with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro to the U.S. dollar since MasterCard Europes functional currency is the euro. The devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the impact of the translation of MasterCard Europes operating results into U.S. dollar amounts are summarized below: 2004 2003 2002 Euro to U.S. dollar average exchange rate $ 1.2383 $ 1.1277 $ .9902 (1) Devaluation of U.S. dollar to euro 10 % 14 % Revenue growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe revenues to U.S. dollars 2 % 2 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe expenses to U.S. dollars 2 % 1 % (1) Average in 2002 is from June 28, 2002, the date of our acquisition of Europay International. Revenues Our revenues are generated from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services, and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands. We establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer transactions on a global basis. We do not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on cards carrying our brands. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for determining these and most other competitive card features. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. MasterCard enters into business agreements with certain customers that provide for fee rebates when those customers meet certain performance based criteria. Such rebates are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the discounted rates for the services provided. In addition, MasterCard enters into agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV based and other performance support incentives. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned or the performance has occurred. The U.S. remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. However, international revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2004, particularly in the European region. Accordingly, revenue generated in the U.S. was approximately 58%, 63% and 61% of total revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The growth in the European region is primarily due to new assessment revenue streams and increased transactions. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10% of total revenues in either period. In addition to the expansion of our business relationships and the global recovery in cross border travel, we believe that our 2004 revenue growth was positively impacted by the worldwide trend in which payments are migrating from paper based forms to electronic forms such as payment cards. This trend has helped drive our volume and revenue growth for a number of years, and we expect it to continue in 2005. However, we expect our net revenue growth in 2005 to be moderated by pricing arrangements with certain large customers. 25 Table of Contents These pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry and the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers and merchants. Operations Fees Operations fees primarily represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement and other payment services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees increased $206 million or 14% in 2004 and $199 million or 16% in 2003, in each case compared to the prior year. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $111 million or 56% of the increase in operations fees in 2003. The significant changes in operations fees were as follows: Change in Revenue Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 (In millions) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 128 $ 172 Currency conversion 47 30 Consulting 19 Customer/ Cardholder services 17 6 Research subscriptions 8 Excessive chargeback penalties (12 ) 15 Other operations fees 25 (8 ) Gross operations fees change $ 232 $ 215 Increase in rebates (26 ) (16 ) Net operations fees change $ 206 $ 199 Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased $128 million, or 16%, in 2004 and $172 million, or 28% in 2003. These revenues are driven by the number of transactions processed through our systems, which increased 23% and 13% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the third quarter 2003, MasterCard began processing the Switch brand in the U.K. which has significantly impacted processed transactions growth. Excluding Switch transactions, processed transaction growth would have been 13% and 10% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2003, a significant portion of the increase in these revenues was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. In 2004 and 2003, the volatility of exchange rates contributed to increased trading settlement revenue of $16 million and $33 million, respectively. Currency conversion revenues increased $47 million in 2004 and $30 million in 2003. These revenues are the result of cross border transactions by cardholders that require currency conversion to settle the transactions between issuers and acquirers. Accordingly, these revenues fluctuate with cross border travel. While the conflict in Iraq, threat of terrorism and outbreak of SARS negatively impacted cross border travel in the beginning of 2003, travel increased significantly in the latter part of 2003 and in 2004. In 2003, the increase was principally due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Consulting fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our advisory services group. During 2004, the incremental consulting revenue is primarily the result of the acquisition of two consulting firms. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Customer/ Cardholder services include revenue earned for providing enhanced services to our customers or their cardholders. Examples of these services are telecommunication assistance, ATM locator and concierge programs. These revenues increased due to an overall increase in the demand for our programs and services. 26 Table of Contents Research subscriptions are generated by MasterCard Advisors, our advisory services group. In 2004, this represents a new revenue stream that resulted from the acquisition of a consulting firm in 2004. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Excessive chargeback fees are charged to acquiring banks with merchants that experience a high level of disputed claims from their customers. During 2004 and 2003, customers were assessed fees of $13 million and $25 million, respectively, for excessive chargebacks in accordance with MasterCard rules. The decrease in excessive chargeback fees in 2004 was the result of the imposition of such fees on one large acquiring customer in 2003 in connection with its merchant activity, in accordance with the MasterCard rules. Other operations fees represent various revenue streams including system services, compliance, sales of holograms, manuals and publications. The change in any individual revenue line is not considered material. Rebates are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates to certain customers continued to increase in 2004, particularly in the United States, due to ongoing consolidation of our customers and increasingly intense competition. Accordingly, rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees increased to 7% in 2004 compared to 6% in 2003. Assessments Assessments are charges that are calculated based on our customers GDV. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on cards carrying our brands for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks. In 2004 and 2003, assessments revenue grew $156 million, or 20% and $140 million, or 21%, respectively. GDV growth was 11% and 6% in 2004 and 2003, respectively, when measured in local currency and 14% and 10%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $94 million or 68% of the increase in assessments in 2003; excluding MasterCard Europe, assessments revenue growth was 8% in 2003. In addition to the increase in GDV, assessments grew due to the following factors: In certain countries in Europe and Latin America, our customers are charged a marketing assessment fee based on volume. These fees are used by MasterCard to expand new and existing market development programs to promote the MasterCard brand in these countries. These fees, which were extended to additional countries in 2003 and 2004, increased $28 million or 37% in 2004 and $49 million or 185% in 2003. Assessment rates vary based on the nature of the transactions that generate the GDV. In 2004, there was stronger growth in international volumes and purchase volumes, which are assessed at higher rates than domestic volumes and cash volumes, respectively. As described above, rebates and incentives provided to our customers and merchants increased in 2004 and 2003. These rebates and incentives reduce revenue, moderate assessments growth and are generally based on GDV, as well as a fixed component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new programs. Rebates and incentives increased $29 million and $72 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 29% and 31% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004 and 2003, we increased the incentives offered to certain customers and merchants to promote usage and acceptance of our brands. Additionally, the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed to the addition of new member contracts by MasterCard Europe subsequent to its acquisition by MasterCard. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2004, there was a decrease in operating expenses of $587 million or 21% compared to the prior year. Excluding the charges to earnings related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, there would have been an increase in operating expenses of $154 million or 7% in 2004 compared to the prior year. Approximately $31 million of the increase in 2004 related to the acquisition of the two consulting firms described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In 2003, there was an increase in operating expenses of $1.1 billion or 62% compared to the prior year, of which $763 million or 70% was a result of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and $197 million or 18% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications and travel. In 2004 and 2003, these activities accounted for approximately 46% and 49% of total revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $87 million in 2004 and $134 million in 2003, primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $110 million or 82% of the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003. The major components of changes in general and administrative expenses are as follows: Change Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 (In millions) Personnel $ 52 $ 98 Professional fees 30 10 Telecommunications (13 ) 1 Data processing 5 10 Travel 5 2 Other 8 13 Net general and administrative change $ 87 $ 134 Personnel expense increased in 2004 primarily due to performance and merit increases resulting from better than anticipated performance against company objectives and the acquisition of the two consulting firms described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In 2003, the increase was primarily due to a full year of salaries and benefits as compared to six months in 2002 resulting from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Professional fees increased in 2004 primarily due to consulting services utilized in developing our strategic initiatives and services related to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Telecommunications expense decreased in 2004 as a result of our ongoing evaluation of telecommunication needs, including renegotiation of certain contracts with service providers. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Travel expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly vary with business activity. Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses, impairment expense and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. 28 Table of Contents Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands. In 2004 and 2003, these activities accounted for approximately 35% and 38% of total revenues, respectively. Advertising and market development expenses increased $65 million or 8% in 2004 and $157 million or 23% in 2003. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $70 million or 45% of the increase in advertising and market development expenses in 2003. Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets which convey symbols that can be readily identified by our customers, as well as our cardholders, creating value for our business. Our advertising and marketing efforts are focused on ensuring that our services are identified, communicated and marketed in a clear, efficient and consistent manner, not only on a local level, but also on a global scale. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our MasterCard brand reputation, image and ultimate value. Our Priceless campaign has run in 96 countries and 48 languages and we continue to invest significantly in this campaign. In 2004, increased media advertising occurred in our European region. In addition, MasterCard has corporate sponsorships and conducts promotions to generate usage of cards carrying our brands. During 2004 and 2003, we sponsored the UEFA Champions League, certain National Football League teams, Major League Baseball, the Professional Golf Association and Universal Studios. MasterCard implemented a four year plan in 2002 to accelerate our growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard and its customers by significantly expanding its spending in advertising and market development. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we spent $192 million and $152 million on advertising and marketing relating to this plan. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition, promote brand acceptance and enhance the development of our programs and services in certain markets. We will continue to evaluate the extent of these initiatives in light of changing market conditions. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court, and other factors. In addition, other legal settlements were made in 2004 and 2003. Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed as follows: Balance as of December 31, 2002 $ U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 763 Interest accretion 43 Payments (134 ) Balance as of December 31, 2003 672 Currency conversion court award of plaintiff attorneys fees 14 Other legal settlements and revisions of U.S. merchant lawsuit opt out estimate 8 Interest accretion 51 Payments (149 ) Other 2 Balance as of December 31, 2004 $ 598 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2 million in 2004 and $29 million in 2003. In 2003, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe as well as additional capitalized computer software. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $17 million or 59% of the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2003. Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions. This technology is continuously updated and improved. Therefore, our investment in capitalized software and related amortization also continues to increase. In recent years we have made the following significant changes to our technology and technology centers, which have caused an increase in our depreciation and amortization: During 2003, our co processing technology center was moved from Lake Success, NY to Kansas City, MO. The cost of the new facility and equipment was $36 million. During 2004 and 2003, we continued to invest in our System Enhancement Strategy, an upgrade of all of MasterCards core systems to improve productivity and lower overall processing costs. Other Income and Expense Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income and interest expense. Investment income decreased $8 million in 2004 and increased $31 million in 2003. The decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value of our trading securities portfolio. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to the consolidation of the variable interest entity (see the discussion in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein) and appreciation of the market value of our trading securities portfolio. Interest expense increased $7 million and $53 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily due to interest expense of $51 million and $43 million, respectively, related to imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. In addition, in 2003 the consolidation of the variable interest entity increased interest expense. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax expense (benefit) rate for years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 26.5%, (36.1)% and 26.5%, respectively. The decrease in the rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment of various tax audit matters, the filing and recognition of refund claims and a one time increase in our deferred state tax assets as a result of additional income subject to higher state and local tax rates. The 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. The amount of the litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was so large that the permanent differences did not significantly affect the tax rate, resulting in a tax benefit at the highest marginal rate. The increase in the rate from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to a one time revaluation in 2002 of MasterCard Europes deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the Belgium statutory tax rate from 40.2% to 34.0% in December 2002. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Dollar Dollar Dollar Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (In millions) (In millions) (In millions) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change $ 324 $ (612 ) $ 158 Federal statutory tax (benefit) $ 113 35.0 % $ (214 ) (35.0 )% $ 55 35.0 % State tax effect, net of Federal benefit 4 1.3 % 2 0.3 % 6 3.9 % Foreign tax effect, net of Federal benefit 4 1.2 % (4 ) (0.6 )% (3 ) (1.7 )% Non deductible expenses and other differences 4 1.0 % 2 0.3 % 5 2.7 % Tax exempt income (7 ) (2.1 )% (7 ) (1.1 )% (7 ) (4.4 )% Adjustment to deferred tax for change in tax rate: United States state (8 ) (2.6 )% Foreign (11 ) (6.9 )% Refund claims and settlement of audit matters: United States (11 ) (3.4 )% Foreign (13 ) (3.9 )% (3 ) (2.1 )% Income tax expense (benefit) $ 86 26.5 % $ (221 ) (36.1 )% $ 42 26.5 % 31 Table of Contents Liquidity We believe our ability to generate cash to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities with which to manage operations, compared to $880 million at December 31, 2003. We expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2005. In addition, we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2005. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Legal, Regulatory and Other Industry Risks. Percent Change 2004 vs. 2003 vs. 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (In millions, except ratio) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 344 $ 190 $ 310 81.1 % (38.7 )% Net cash used in investing activities (275 ) (170 ) (213 ) (61.8 )% 20.2 % Net cash used in financing activities (35 ) ** ** Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 1,903 $ 1,610 $ 1,456 18.2 % 10.6 % Current liabilities 1,301 1,189 930 9.4 % 27.8 % Long term liabilities 984 1,009 307 (2.5 )% 228.7 % Equity 975 699 1,023 39.5 % (31.7 )% Working capital ratio 1.46 1.35 1.57 ** Not meaningful Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 and 2003 was generated principally by current period earnings (losses) exclusive of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and legal settlements. The liabilities related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement and other legal settlements discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein will be funded through existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity. We recorded expense of $22 million and $763 million for legal settlement costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and had related cash payments totaling $149 million and $134 million, respectively. The utilization of cash for investing activities in 2004 was primarily due to purchases of available for sale securities and the acquisition of certain businesses as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In 2004 and 2003, we also invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchase of fixed assets to support our business. Our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our customers through our proprietary global computer and telecommunications system. Our investing activities in 2003 included funding for a co processing facility in Kansas City, Missouri, and associated equipment. In addition to our liquid investments, we provide for liquidity through a committed $1.95 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with certain financial institutions which expires on June 17, 2005. The Credit Facility replaced MasterCard Incorporateds prior $1.2 billion credit facility which expired on June 18, 2004. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard International members and, subject to a limit of $300 million, for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 28 basis points. An additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate 32 Table of Contents borrowings under the Credit Facility exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee which varies based on MasterCards credit rating and is currently equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment. MasterCard was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2004. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2004. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. Due to Standard & Poors assessment of MasterCards vulnerability to legal risk, on May 16, 2003, Standard & Poors lowered MasterCards counterparty credit rating to A /A 2, subordinated debt rating to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on negative outlook. These ratings were reaffirmed in 2004. This rating has not materially impacted our liquidity. Legal, Regulatory and Other Industry Risks Our business has many industry risks, most significantly the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate. These risks have increased in recent years, although we are proactively seeking to address them. For a complete description of the risks facing our business; see Risk Factors in Item 1 Business of this Report. The following risks, among others, may have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: Legal and Regulatory Proceedings MasterCard is a party to several legal and regulatory proceedings, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Many of the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are subject are supported by merchants, who have a growing role in the global payments industry. See Merchant Acceptance Initiatives in Item 1 Business of this Report. Competition and Consolidation of Our Customers We are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers, acquirers and merchants. Most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers. In addition, the consolidation and globalization of our customers has provided more intense competition and greater demand for rebates, incentives and reduced pricing for our services. The consolidation or merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues. Economic Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In the past, our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. The tsunami in Asia did not impact our 2004 revenue; however we intend to closely monitor the impact as the recovery from the tsunami evolves in 2005. 33 Table of Contents Future Obligations The following table summarizes as of December 31, 2004 our obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Capital leases(a) $ 63 $ 9 $ 8 $ 4 $ 42 Operating leases(b) 123 37 55 29 2 Sponsorship, licensing & other(c) 570 254 251 52 13 U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements(d) 829 129 200 200 300 Debt(e) 250 5 11 234 Total $ 1,835 $ 434 $ 525 $ 519 $ 357 (a) Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co processing facility. (b) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. (c) Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include purchase obligations. Obligations which result from performance based agreements with our members and merchants have been excluded from the table due to their contingent nature. (d) Represents amounts due in accordance with legal settlements entered into during 2003 and refined in 2004, including the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. (e) Debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and the principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes due September 2009. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2004 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. Member Relationships and Related Parties We have a diversified member base of approximately 2,200 principal members and approximately 21,500 affiliate members. Our stockholders are principal members of MasterCard International. In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of MasterCard International. One customer, JP Morgan Chase Bank generated 12% of our revenue in 2004. In addition, certain other customers generate in excess of five percent of our revenue. The loss of any of these members could adversely impact MasterCards net income. In addition, as part of our business initiative to grow our business, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with members. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to permit members in the United States that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the antitrust litigation brought against us by the U.S. Department of Justice. Any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. However, we believe 34 Table of Contents that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Effect if Actual Results Differ Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Certain revenues are estimated. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein contains a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. Certain revenues are recorded based on an estimate of our customers performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 35 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Effect if Actual Results Differ Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used from Assumptions Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein contains a complete discussion of the Merchant Lawsuit. We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement to be 8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A 1% increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2005, and declining amounts thereafter. A 1% decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2005, and declining amounts thereafter. In addition, a 1% change in the discount rate would have impacted the amount we recorded as an after tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 by approximately $20 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (except Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. In performing the analyses, we primarily utilize independent valuation experts. The test methods employed involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on managements judgment using internal and external data. During 2004, the Company identified and recorded impairment losses of approximately $7 million for one of the acquisitions completed in 2004. We completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $426 million as of December 31, 2004. 36 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Effect if Actual Results Differ Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used from Assumptions Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, which could be material. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset in excess of the net deferred tax asset or we were unable to realize a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets herein. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. During the year, no significant impairment charges were recorded. However, if actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2004 was $120 million. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein contains a complete discussion of our accounting policies for intangible assets. On an ongoing basis, we perform impairment analyses on various technologies. If the carrying value of the various technologies exceeds the fair value, impairment charges are recorded. Pensions Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual pension costs and the disclosure of the funded position of our pension plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans projected benefit obligation and the expected rate of return on plan assets. We utilized a discount rate of 5.75 percent in measuring the projected pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2004, 6.25 percent in calculating the net periodic pension cost and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation by $1.5 million, and would have a negligible effect on our annual pension expense. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.3 million. 37 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106 (SFAS 132). This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. We have fully implemented SFAS 132 for the year ended December 31, 2004. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (EITF 03 01). EITF 03 01 provides guidance to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists for available for sale or held to maturity investments under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Investments and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method. EITF 03 01 also requires certain disclosures related to investments that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date. The FASB has indefinitely deferred the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF 03 01, through FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. EITF Issue 03 1 1. We have fully implemented all of the required disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 109 2 (FSP 109 2), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). FSP 109 2 provides enterprises more time (beyond the financial reporting period during which the Act took effect) to evaluate the Acts impact on the enterprises plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We are not intending to repatriate under the Act, therefore FSP 109 2 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the board of directors, governing our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31, 2003. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $41 million and $64 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $20 million and $60 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $2.0 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 38 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004 and 2003, forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of $128 million and $178 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $11 million and $16 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of seventeen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 143 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium term instruments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $17 million for each of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our held to maturity investments are not be subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of $9 million and $12 million for December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, under these credit facilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $3 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. To the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. 39 Table of Contents
