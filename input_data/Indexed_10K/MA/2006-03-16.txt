Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe) (together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Overview We are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers credit, debit and related payment programs. We manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment card brands including MasterCard&reg;, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro&reg; and Cirrus&reg;, which we license to our financial institution customers. As part of managing these brands, we also provide our customers with information and transaction processing services and establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system by customers and merchants. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing these transaction processing and other payment related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gross dollar volume (GDV) of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Operations fees are typically transaction based and include authorization, settlement and switch, connectivity, currency conversion, warning bulletins, and other fees for a variety of additional services. Assessments are based on GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate GDV. GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard branded cards. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Our operating expenses are comprised primarily of general and administrative expenses such as personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications, travel and advertising and marketing expenses to promote our brands, including promotions and sponsorships. We evaluate and monitor our business based on our results from operations, including our percentage of revenue growth and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue, and our financial position. In addition, we utilize growth in GDV and processed transactions to monitor the strength of our business. Our liquidity and capital position are strong. We had $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities, and $1.2 billion in stockholders equity as of December 31, 2005. We achieved double digit revenue growth of 13% in 2005. The increase in revenues was due to higher gross usage on cards carrying our brands for goods and services, a larger number of transactions processed by MasterCard, higher cross border travel by cardholders using our cards and certain pricing changes that went into effect on April 1, 2005. The pricing changes including implementing new fees, increasing existing fees or 41 Table of Contents modifying our fee calculation methodology accounted for approximately 5% of net revenue growth in 2005. Significant changes in the methodology for calculating fees primarily related to a component of settlement fees being changed from tiered pricing to a flat rate, a component of authorization fees being changed from monthly pricing to weekly pricing which increased utilization, and connectivity fees being expanded to include a charge for the volume of information being transmitted in addition to the fixed fee initially charged. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, increased 11% in 2005. We continued to reduce our operating expenses, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, as a percentage of total revenues to 84% in 2005 from 86% in 2004. In June 2002, we acquired Europay International S.A. (now MasterCard Europe). In 2004, we acquired a research firm and a consulting firm, both of which were immaterial to our operations. The results of operations for these acquisitions are included from their respective acquisition dates. We successfully complied with Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 testing three years ahead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions deadline for non accelerated filers. We concluded, based on our assessment, that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2005. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Our strategy is to drive growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry (such as corporate payments, prepaid cards and chip based cards), enhancing our merchant relationships, maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We intend to expand our role in targeted geographies by, among other things, pursuing incremental payment processing opportunities in the European Union in connection with the implementation of the Single European Payment Area initiative and in Latin America and Asia/Pacific countries. We are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to leverage our expertise in payment programs, brand marketing, product development, technology, processing and consulting services for these customers. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time, and in support of this strategy, we are hiring additional resources and developing sales and other personnel. There is increased regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees and other aspects of the payments industry which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we face exposure to antitrust and other types of litigation. Competition and pricing pressure within the global payments industry is increasing, due in part to consolidation within the banking sector and the growing power of merchants. Regulatory actions, litigation, and pricing pressure may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues. See Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report for these and other risks facing our business. We are party to a number of currency conversion litigations as discussed in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these cases and pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, MasterCard recorded an additional $75 million of legal reserves in 2005. As a result of these additional reserves, we have now established total legal reserves of $89 million in connection with these currency conversion cases. This estimate may be revised based on future developments in these cases. Proposed New Ownership and Governance Structure We are pursuing a plan for new ownership and governance structure that will include the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors that will be independent of MasterCard and our members, the establishment of a charitable foundation and the transition to being a publicly traded company. 42 Table of Contents Under the proposed ownership and governance structure, MasterCards current stockholders are expected to retain a 44% equity interest (or 41% of our equity if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) in the company through ownership of new non voting class B common stock. In addition, existing stockholders are expected to receive a new class M common stock that will have no economic rights but will provide them with certain rights, including the right to approve specified significant corporate actions and entitle them to elect up to three of MasterCards directors (but not more than one quarter of all directors) but are otherwise non voting. MasterCard also intends to issue shares of a new voting class A common stock to public investors through an initial public offering. Upon successful completion of the offering, these public investors will hold shares representing an expected 46% of the Companys equity and 82% of its general voting power (or 49% of our equity and 83% of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Additional shares of class A common stock, representing approximately 10% of the Companys equity and 18% of its voting rights (or 17% of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), are expected to be issued as a donation to The MasterCard Foundation, a charitable foundation incorporated in Canada (the Foundation). This donation will have a dilutive effect on each existing stockholders equity interest in the Company. The Foundation will build on MasterCards existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education, understand and utilize technology and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force. In addition, the Foundation will work in conjunction with organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities in order to enhance local economies and develop entrepreneurs. We are in the process of identifying directors of the Foundation that will be required to be independent of us and our members. In connection with this donation we expect to record an expense that is equal to the aggregate value of the Class A common stock we are donating at the time of the offering together with approximately $40 million in cash to be donated to the Foundation over a period of up to four years in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations, and we may make additional cash contributions to the Foundation after this period. Because the Foundations operations are currently being established, the overall size and timing of our expected initial cash donation have not been finally determined. The value of the shares of Class A common stock we donate will be determined based on the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in the initial public offering less a marketability discount. This marketability discount and the methodology used to quantify it will be determined by management in consultation with independent valuation consultants to be retained by MasterCard. As a result of this expense, we expect to record a significant net loss for the quarter in which the offering is completed and may record a net loss for the 2006 fiscal year. We also expect to record expense equal to the value of any cash we donate in the period or periods in which such donation or donations are made. These donations will generally not be deductible to MasterCard for tax purposes. Accordingly, as a result of the difference between financial statement and tax treatments of the donations, we expect there to be a significant increase to our effective tax rate in the periods in which the contributions are made. We intend to use all but $650 million of our net proceeds from the initial public offering (including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) to redeem a number of shares of Class B common stock from our existing stockholders that is equal to the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock that we issue to investors in the initial public offering (including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) and to the Foundation. As a result, our existing stockholders will own 41% of the Companys equity. We intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital, defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges, expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes. However, we have not determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to these purposes. Implementation of the new ownership and governance structure is subject to various approvals, including requisite regulatory filings. Our stockholders approved the new ownership and governance structure at a special meeting on November 28, 2005. 43 Table of Contents In addition, in connection with our new ownership and governance structure we intend to implement equity based compensation plans. The implementation date of these plans has not been determined as the underlying transactions have not been completed. We expect to convert our existing long term incentive cash award plans into an equity based compensation plan. Based on the proposal for this conversion, we may recognize $11 million additional personnel expense in future periods based on vesting within the plans. Our Compensation Committee has also granted 2006 awards under the equity based long term incentive plan. We also intend to grant a one time restricted stock unit award to non executive management employees which will result in deferred stock based compensation equal to the fair value of the restricted stock units on the grant date, which will be amortized over the three year vesting period. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Assessment fees are calculated based on local currency volume, which is converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the quarter. As a result, assessment revenues increased in each period due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. In 2005 and 2004, a 13% and 15% increase in GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis, respectively, exceeded local currency GDV growth of 12% and 11%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar since the functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro. The devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the impact of the translation of MasterCard Europes operating results into U.S. dollar amounts are summarized as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Euro to U.S. dollar average exchange rate $ 1.2455 $ 1.2383 $ 1.1277 Devaluation of U.S. dollar to euro (1 )% (10 )% (14 )% Revenue growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe revenues to U.S. dollars 2 % 2 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe expenses to U.S. dollars 2 % 1 % Revenues We earned approximately 66%, 63% and 64% of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 34%, 37% and 36% of our net revenues from net assessments in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operations fees are user fees for facilitating the processing of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCards system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders banks), acquirers (the merchants banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operation fees are as follows: Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholders transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to or from the issuer or in certain circumstances, such as when the issuers systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuers instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. Once quantified we transfer the financial transaction details and relevant funds among issuers, acquirers or their designated third party processors. We charge a fee for these settlement services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. 44 Table of Contents Switch fees are fees for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (MDS), our debit processing system. The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between members and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Currency conversion fees are volume based fees charged to issuers for foreign currency conversion. We process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies. As a result of our global system, cardholders have the ability to pay for transactions in the local currency of a merchant and for the charge to appear on the cardholders statement in their own home currency. Accordingly, currency conversion is required for cross border transactions to complete the settlement between issuers and acquirers. Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S. based. Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. The methodology for calculating the transmission fees was changed on April 1, 2005 so that they are based on the volume of information being transmitted through our systems and the number of connections to our systems. Prior to April 1, 2005, these transmission fees were calculated solely based on the number of connections. Consulting and research fees as well as outsourcing services fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting, information and outsourcing services associated with our customers payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate research becoming a significant percentage of our business. MasterCard Advisors revenues, of which consulting and research fees are components, are less than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Other operations fees are primarily user pay services including the sale of manuals, publications, holograms, information and reports, as well as compliance programs, to assist our customers in managing their businesses. In addition, other operations fees include fees for cardholder services in connection with the benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards or locating automated teller machines. Generally we process all MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the U.S. and in a few international markets. We process substantially all cross border MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus transactions. We charge relatively higher operations fee rates for settlement, authorization and switch fees on cross border transactions and earn currency conversion fees if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies. Offline debit transactions are generally signature based debit transactions and are processed and priced similar to credit transactions. Operation fees for processing online debit transactions (Maestro and Cirrus transactions) are priced in a similar manner as offline debit and credit transactions. Assessments are calculated based on our customers GDV. Assessment rates vary by region. Most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles. These rates also vary by the type of transaction. We generally assess at higher rates for cross border volumes compared to domestic volumes. We also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals. Credit and offline transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions. In addition, from time to time the Company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. These assessments are often introduced at the request of customers in a particular region or country. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. 45 Table of Contents In 2005 and 2004, gross revenue grew 21% and 16%, respectively. A component of our revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2005 was the result of implementing new fees and changes to existing fees charged to our customers on April 1, 2005. However, this growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance based support incentives. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 22%, 16% and 17% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry and the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers and merchants. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period that performance occurs. We establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customers transactions on a global basis. Our customers may choose to engage third parties for transaction processing and are responsible to ensure that these third parties comply with our standards. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. The United States remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. However, international revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the international revenue growth was not specifically related to one region in which we do business. However, in 2004, the growth was primarily in the European region due to new assessment revenue streams and increased transactions. Accordingly, revenue generated in the United States was approximately 55%, 58% and 63% of total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In the past, our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. Consumer behavior can be impacted by a number of factors, including confidence in the MasterCard brand. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions, except per share, percent and GDV amounts) Operations fees $ 1,941 $ 1,637 $ 1,431 18.6 % 14.4 % Assessments 997 956 800 4.3 % 19.5 % Net revenue 2,938 2,593 2,231 13.3 % 16.2 % General and administrative 1,352 1,186 1,099 14.0 % 7.9 % Advertising and market development 1,008 916 851 10.0 % 7.6 % U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 75 22 763 240.9 % (97.1 )% Depreciation and amortization 110 122 120 (9.8 )% 1.7 % Total operating expenses 2,545 2,246 2,833 13.3 % (20.7 )% Operating income (loss) 393 347 (602 ) 13.3 % 157.6 % Total other income (expense) 14 (23 ) (10 ) 160.9 % (130.0 )% Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change 407 324 (612 ) 25.6 % 152.9 % Income tax expense (benefit) 140 86 (221 ) 62.8 % 138.9 % Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax 5 (100.0 )% Net income (loss) $ 267 $ 238 $ (386 ) 12.2 % 161.7 % Net income (loss) per share (basic and diluted)1 $ 2.67 $ 2.38 $ (3.86 ) 12.2 % 161.7 % Pro forma net income (loss) per share (basic and diluted)2 $ 1.98 $ 1.76 $ (2.86 ) 12.5 % 161.5 % Weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted)1 100 100 100 Pro forma weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted)2 135 135 135 Effective income tax (benefit) rate 34.5 % 26.5 % (36.1 )% * * * * Gross dollar volume (GDV) on a US dollar converted basis (in billions) 1,660.6 1,466.8 1,281.4 13.2 % 14.5 % Processed transactions3 13,993.3 12,324.5 10,056.3 13.5 % 22.6 % ** Not meaningful 1 As more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, in connection with the ownership and governance transactions we will reclassify all of our 100 outstanding shares of existing Class A redeemable common stock so that our existing stockholders will receive 1.35 shares of our Class B common stock for each share of Class A redeemable common stock that they held prior to the reclassification and a single share of our Class M common stock. Accordingly, shares and per share data will be retroactively restated in the financial statements subsequent to the reclassification to reflect the reclassification as if it were effective at the start of the first period being presented in the financial statements. 2 Pro forma amounts give effect to the reclassification described above as if it were in place for the periods presented. 3 The data for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 has been restated to conform with the methodology utilized in calculating processed transactions in 2005. Prior to 2005, processed transactions reported by MasterCard included certain MasterCard branded (excludes Maestro and Cirrus) transactions for which we received transaction details from our customers but which were not processed by our systems. Our management determined in 2005 that it would be more appropriate to exclude such transactions from the processed transactions calculation. The processed transactions for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 have been restated to be consistent with the calculation of processed transactions in 2005. Revenue has not been impacted by this change. 47 Table of Contents Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2005 2004 (In millions, except percent) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,055 $ 913 $ 785 $ 142 $ 128 15.6 % 16.3 % Currency conversion 317 281 234 36 47 12.8 % 20.1 % Acceptance development fees 171 85 84 86 1 101.2 % 1.2 % Warning bulletin fees 70 66 70 4 (4 ) 6.1 % (5.7 )% Connectivity 63 35 34 28 1 80.0 % 2.9 % Consulting and research fees 63 38 12 25 26 65.8 % 216.7 % Other operations fees 378 337 304 41 33 12.2 % 10.9 % Gross operations fees 2,117 1,755 1,523 362 232 20.6 % 15.2 % Rebates (176 ) (118 ) (92 ) (58 ) (26 ) 49.2 % 28.3 % Net operations fees $ 1,941 $ 1,637 $ 1,431 $ 304 $ 206 18.6 % 14.4 % Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems increasing 14% and 23% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, a portion of the revenue increase was due to the pricing of a component of these revenues being restructured on April 1, 2005. In the third quarter 2003, MasterCard began processing transactions related to the Switch brand, a domestic U.K. debit brand, which significantly impacted processed transactions growth and accordingly contributed to the increase in revenues. Excluding Switch transactions, processed transaction growth would have been 13% in 2004. The volatility of exchange rates contributed to decreased settlement trading revenue of $2 million in 2005 and increased settlement trading revenue of $16 million and $33 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Currency conversion revenues fluctuate with the level of cross border transactions and our customers need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. While the conflict in Iraq, threat of terrorism and outbreak of SARS negatively impacted cross border travel in the beginning of 2003, cross border travel increased significantly in the latter part of 2003, and continued to grow in 2004 and in 2005. Connectivity revenues in 2005 increased primarily due to a change in the connectivity fee structure on April 1, 2005. Acceptance development fees increased in 2005 primarily due to the implementation of new fees and increases on the pricing of existing fees which occurred on April 1, 2005. Consulting and research fees increased primarily due to new engagements with our customers in 2005 and 2004 and the acquisition of a research firm in the first quarter of 2004. Warning bulletin fees fluctuate with our customer requests for distribution of invalid account information. Other operations fees represent various revenue streams including cardholder services, compliance, holograms, and manuals and publications. The change in any individual revenue line was not material. Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates have been increasing due to agreements with new customers, renewals of existing agreements, ongoing consolidation of our customers and competition. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 8%, 7%, and 6% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions, except percent) Gross assessments $ 1,631 $ 1,341 $ 1,156 $ 290 $ 185 21.6 % 16.0 % Rebates and incentives (634 ) (385 ) (356 ) (249 ) (29 ) 64.7 % 8.1 % Net assessments $ 997 $ 956 $ 800 $ 41 $ 156 4.3 % 19.5 % GDV growth was 12% and 11% in 2005 and 2004, respectively, when measured in local currency terms, and 13% and 15%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. In addition to the increase in GDV, assessments grew due to the following factors: Assessments for marketing programs and other specific purposes increased in 2005, 2004, and 2003. We introduced new or increased assessments for market development programs in specific countries or regions within Europe and Latin America. In 2005, offsetting a portion of the increase in assessments was the elimination of an assessment for the promotion of soccer in the European region, which became a component of the core assessment rates in 2005. Assessment rates vary based on the nature of the transactions that generate the GDV. In 2005 and 2004, there was stronger growth in international volumes and purchase volumes, which are generally assessed at higher rates than domestic volumes and cash volumes, respectively. Acquirer volumes were greater in 2005 and are generally assessed at higher rates than issuer volumes, accordingly acquirer assessments increased during 2005. In addition, new acquirer assessments were implemented in Canada. Rebates and incentives provided to customers and merchants relating to assessments reduce revenue, moderate assessments growth and are generally based on GDV, as well as a fixed component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new programs. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 39%, 29% and 31% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the percentage of rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments was the result of new or revised pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants in 2005 and 2004. We expect our agreements with our customers and merchants to continue to moderate net revenue growth in 2006 and subsequent years. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses. We reduced our operating expenses, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, as a percentage of total revenues to 84% in 2005 from 86% in 2004 and 93% in 2003. Operating expenses increased $299 million or 13% in 2005 compared to a decrease of $587 million or 21% in 2004. Excluding the charges to earnings related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, there would have been an increase in operating expenses of $246 million, or 11%, in 2005 and $154 million, or 7%, in 2004. Operating expenses increased in 2004 by $31 million in connection with the acquisition of a research firm and a consulting firm. 49 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications and travel. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, these activities accounted for approximately 46%, 46% and 49% of total revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The major components of general and administrative expenses were as follows: For the years ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 (In millions, except percent) Personnel $ 890 $ 741 $ 689 $ 149 $ 52 20.1 % 7.5 % Professional fees 135 130 100 5 30 3.8 % 30.0 % Telecommunications 71 74 87 (3 ) (13 ) (4.1 )% (14.9 )% Data processing 62 59 54 3 5 5.1 % 9.3 % Travel 84 66 61 18 5 27.3 % 8.2 % Other 110 116 108 (6 ) 8 (5.2 )% 7.4 % General and administrative expenses $ 1,352 $ 1,186 $ 1,099 $ 166 $ 87 14.0 % 7.9 % Personnel expense increased for the following reasons: We hired additional staff to support our strategic initiatives. As we continue to expand our customer focused approach and expand our relationships with merchants, additional personnel are required. We changed our methodology of recognizing the cost of executive incentive cash award plans in 2005, as more fully described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which resulted in a catch up adjustment of $19 million in 2005. We updated the assumptions for our severance plan accrual which resulted in higher severance costs of $20 million in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was offset by an $8 million reduction in the expense for actual severed employees in 2005. We awarded higher performance awards and merit increases in 2005 and 2004, which resulted from better than anticipated performance against company objectives. We acquired two consulting firms in 2004. Professional fees increased in 2005 and 2004 primarily due to legal fees and consulting services used to develop and implement our strategic initiatives. Consulting services and audit fees increased in 2005 and 2004 relating to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Telecommunications expense decreased in 2005 and 2004 as a result of our ongoing evaluation of telecommunication needs, including renegotiation of certain contracts with service providers. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Travel expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly have increased with the corresponding increase in our business activity. Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brands and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands. In 2005, 2004 and 2003 these activities accounted for approximately 34%, 35% and 38% of total revenues, respectively. Advertising and market development expenses increased $92 million, or 10%, in 2005 and $65 million, or 8%, in 2004. 50 Table of Contents Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets. Our approach to marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated package designed to increase MasterCard brand awareness and preference and usage of MasterCard cards. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court, and other factors. We are party to a number of currency conversion litigations which are more fully described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these currency conversion cases and pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we recorded a $14 million reserve in 2004 and an additional $75 million reserve in 2005. This estimate may need to be revised based on future developments. Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed as follows (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2003 $ 672 Currency conversion court award of plaintiff attorneys fees 14 Other legal settlements and revisions of U.S. merchant lawsuit opt out estimate 10 Interest accretion 51 Payments (149 ) Balance as of December 31, 2004 598 Legal settlement accrual for currency conversion litigations 75 Interest accretion 47 Payments (115 ) Balance as of December 31, 2005 $ 605 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $12 million in 2005 and increased $2 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily related to the maturity of certain capital leases and certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions. This technology is continuously updated and improved. During 2004, we completed a five year upgrade of all of MasterCards core systems to improve productivity and lower overall processing costs. In addition, in 2003, our co processing technology center was moved from Lake Success, New York to Kansas City, Missouri. Our Lake Success co processing facility would have required a significant investment to rehabilitate its aging infrastructure and improve security. Kansas City, Missouri was selected as the new location for the co processing facility due to its relative proximity to our other processing facility in St. Louis, Missouri. The cost of the new facility and equipment was $36 million. 51 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. Investment income increased $12 million in 2005 and decreased $8 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates. The decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value of our trading securities portfolio. Interest expense was the same in 2005 and 2004 and increased $7 million in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to interest expense related to imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. In 2005, we recognized $17 million in other gains relating to a settlement of a dispute of a customer business agreement and $9 million in gains relating the sale of two affiliated investments. Income Taxes The effective income tax expense (benefit) rate for years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 34.5%, 26.5% and (36.1)%, respectively. The rate in 2005 was higher than 2004 primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment, during 2004, of various tax audit issues discussed below. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 as compared to 2003 is attributable to the reassessment, during 2004, of tax issues under examination in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the years 1998 through 2000 and issues under examination in Japan for the years 2000 through 2003. In the course of the IRS audit, affirmative refund claims were filed and the related tax benefits were recognized. In addition, MasterCard favorably settled a foreign tax audit in India for the years 1996 through 2001. The 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. The amount of the litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was such that the permanent differences for 2003, which are shown in the table below, did not significantly affect the tax rate, resulting in a tax benefit at the highest marginal tax rate. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Dollar Amount Percent Dollar Amount Percent Dollar Amount Percent (In millions, except percent) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change $ 407 $ 324 $ (612 ) Federal statutory tax (benefit) $ 143 35.0 % $ 113 35.0 % $ (214 ) (35.0 )% State tax effect, net of Federal benefit 4 0.9 % 4 1.3 % 2 0.3 % Foreign tax effect, net of Federal benefit 5 1.1 % 4 1.2 % (4 ) (0.6 )% Non deductible expenses and other differences (2 ) (0.3 )% 4 1.0 % 2 0.3 % Tax exempt income (8 ) (2.0 )% (7 ) (2.1 )% (7 ) (1.1 )% Adjustment to deferred tax for change in tax rate: United States state (8 ) (2.6 )% Foreign Refund claims and settlement of audit matters: United States 1 0.3 % (11 ) (3.4 )% Foreign (2 ) (0.5 )% (13 ) (3.9 )% Income tax expense (benefit) $ 141 34.5 % $ 86 26.5 % $ (221 ) (36.1 )% Liquidity We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities with which to manage operations. We expect that the cash generated from operations and our 52 Table of Contents borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2006. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Item 1A Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions, except percent) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 273 $ 344 $ 190 (20.6 )% 81.1 % Net cash used in investing activities (34 ) (275 ) (170 ) 87.6 % (61.8 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 2,228 $ 1,903 $ 1,610 17.1 % 18.2 % Current liabilities 1,557 1,301 1,189 19.7 % 9.4 % Long term liabilities 970 984 1,009 (1.4 )% (2.5 )% Equity 1,169 975 699 19.9 % 39.5 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, our operations provided $273 million of cash, compared to $344 million in 2004. In 2005 and 2004, we made $115 million and $149 million, respectively, in payments related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and $40 million and $15 million, respectively, of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan. The decrease in cash from operations in 2005 from 2004 period was due to higher income tax payments and prepayments made in accordance with new customer incentive agreements. Maintaining our customer relationships pursuant to these incentive agreements has required MasterCard to provide more as well as higher prepayments of rebates and incentives than in previous periods. These cash outflows are offset by stronger operating performance and an increase in accruals for personnel costs associated with the Companys employee incentive and severance plans. The increase in cash from operations in 2004 from 2003 was primarily due to stronger operating performance in 2004 compared to 2003. The utilization of cash for investing activities in 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to purchases exceeding sales of available for sale securities and the acquisition of certain businesses. In 2005 and 2004, we also invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchase of fixed assets to support our business. Our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our customers through our proprietary global computer and telecommunications system. Our investing activities in 2003 included $36 million for a co processing facility in Kansas City, Missouri, and associated equipment. Under the terms of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement, the Company is required to pay $100 million annually each December through the year 2012. Additionally, in accordance with the Companys employee incentive plans, certain payouts to participants are made in the first quarter of each year. In addition to our liquid investments, on June 17, 2005, we entered into a committed unsecured $2.25 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as sole lead arranger, Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co administrative agents, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., as co arranger, HSBC Bank (USA), N.A., Lloyds TSB Bank, plc and Royal Bank of Scotland, as co syndication agents, and certain other lenders. The Credit Facility, which expires on June 16, 2006, replaced our prior $1.95 billion credit facility which expired on June 17, 2005. Borrowings under the facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard International members and, subject to a limit of $300 million, for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 28 basis points or an alternative base rate. An additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate borrowings under the Credit Facility exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee which varies based on MasterCards credit rating and is currently equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment, or approximately $1.6 million annually. MasterCard 53 Table of Contents was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2005. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. Due to Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) assessment of MasterCards vulnerability to legal risk, on May 16, 2003, S&P lowered MasterCards counterparty credit rating to A /A 2, subordinated debt rating to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on negative outlook. Following the announcement of the ownership and governance transactions, S&P placed us on credit watch with negative implications. Pending completion of the initial public offering, S&P expects to lower our counterparty credit ratings to BBB+/A 2 and our subordinated debt rating to BBB, both with stable outlook. Until such time, the existing ratings will remain on credit watch with negative implications. Once the lower ratings are in effect, the facility fee for our Credit Facility will increase to 8 basis points on the total commitment, or approximately $1.8 million annually, and interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would increase to LIBOR plus 37 basis points (or 47 basis points if aggregate borrowings exceed 33% of the commitments) or an alternative base rate. MasterCard Europe and European Payment System Services sprl, a subsidiary of MasterCard, have a 1 million euro overdraft facility for MasterCard Europe and European Payment System Services sprl and a 1 million euro guarantee facility for MasterCard Europe. Interest on borrowings under the overdraft facility is charged at 50 basis points over the relevant market index and interest for the guarantee facility is paid at a rate of 1.5% per annum on outstanding guarantees. There were no material borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Deutsche Bank AG is the lender of these facilities and is a member of MasterCard International. MasterCard Europe has one additional uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros. The interest rate under this facility is Euro LIBOR plus 50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100 million euros and Euro LIBOR plus 250 basis points for amounts over the 100 million euro limit. For drawings in currencies other than the euro, interest will be charged at the above margins over the relevant currency base rate. There were no borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2005 and 2004. HSBC Bank plc is the lender of this facility and is a member of MasterCard International. After the consummation of the initial public offering, we intend to adopt a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend for our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, unless our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2005, our contractual non cancelable obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More Than 5 Years (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 57 $ 5 $ 7 $ 3 $ 42 Operating leases2 113 35 49 21 8 Sponsorship, licensing & other3 551 288 225 31 7 U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements4 789 189 200 200 200 Debt5 243 5 88 150 Executive incentive plan benefit6 62 62 Total $ 1,815 $ 584 $ 569 $ 405 $ 257 54 Table of Contents 1 Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co processing facility. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with leases for computer hardware, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $304 million as of December 31, 2005 related to these agreements. 4 Represents amounts due in accordance with legal settlements, including the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. 5 Debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and the principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes due September 2009. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2005 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. 6 Represents Executive Incentive Plan and the Senior Executive Incentive Plan cash payments to be paid in 2006 and amounts currently due to employees should they terminate employment. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. These amounts exclude the portion of the award that is eligible to be converted to restricted stock units. Related Parties We have approximately 1,493 existing stockholders who are also our customers. See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions of this Report for a description of certain agreements between us and our principal stockholders. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2005, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $981 million, or 33% of total net revenue. In January 2006, one of these customers purchased another of our key customers (not among our top five revenue contributors). Accordingly, the amounts for 2005 for this customer include the revenues of the other customer acquired. The loss of any of these members could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Seasonality Portions of our business are seasonal. Our gross revenue is favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period. However, advertising, holiday promotions and incentives also increase correspondingly, generally causing our profitability to decline in the fourth quarter. 55 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Revenue Recognition Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Total assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for 15%, 11% and 12% of those assessment revenues, representing 5%, 4% and 4% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 16 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 56 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement We have entered into a settlement agreement in connection with the U.S. merchant lawsuit. This settlement was discounted over the ten year payment term of the settlement. We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement in 2003 to be 8%. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2006, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate. In addition, a 1 percent change in the discount rate would have impacted the amount we recorded as an after tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 by approximately $20 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (except Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. The test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on managements judgment using internal and external data. We utilize independent valuation experts, if needed. We completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein, and no significant impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $376 million, including $172 million of unamortized customer relationships, as of December 31, 2005. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. 57 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset in excess of the net deferred tax asset or if we were unable to realize a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. If actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2005 was $94 million. On an ongoing basis, we perform impairment analyses on various technologies. If the carrying value of the various technologies exceeds the fair value, impairment charges are recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2005, no significant impairment charges were recorded. Pensions and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. This pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits based on each participants account balance. Additionally, the Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by U.S. tax laws. The Company also maintains a postretirement plan The discount rate for the Company pension and postretirement plans is subject to change, each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. We referenced the Moodys Aa Corporate Bond Index, arithmetically rounded, to select our discount rate to measure the projected benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement plans. In order to validate the appropriateness of the rate, an analysis was performed which matched the plans expected cash flows (determined on a PBO basis) with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation (PBO) by $1.2 million, and would have a negligible effect on our annual pension expense. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. 58 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its U.S. employees and retirees. Certain assumptions are used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans projected benefit obligation for pension and postretirement, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan. generating a discount rate. Our discount rate of 5.50% as of December 31, 2005 was reasonable as compared to the rate derived from the analysis described above. This rate of 5.50% is a decline of 25 basis points from the 5.75% rate used in calculating the net periodic benefit costs for 2004. Net actuarial gains and or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans. We determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets. The expected rate of our pension plan assets is 8.50% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.4 million. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs. A complete analysis of the cost impact resulting from a change in this assumption is fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109 2 (FSP 109 2), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). FSP 109 2 provides enterprises more time (beyond the financial reporting period during which the Act took effect) to evaluate the Acts impact on the enterprises plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We are not presently intending to repatriate any foreign earnings as defined under the Act. Therefore, FSP 109 2 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), Share Based Payment. SFAS 123R provides guidance on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments. The Company intends to adopt SFAS 123R in connection with the implementation of equity based compensation plans as part of the Companys new ownership and governance structure. The implementation date of these plans has not been determined and the underlying transactions remain subject to approval by the Companys stockholders. The adoption of SFAS 123R is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 59 Table of Contents In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The implementation of SFAS 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the board of directors, governing our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $78 million and $41 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $33 million and $20 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2005 and 2004 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $4 million and $2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of $218 million and $128 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $39 million and no open contracts, respectively). Based on the year end 2005 and 2004 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $16 million and $11 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of nineteen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 146 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium term instruments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity 60 Table of Contents and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $19 million and $17 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our held to maturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of $5 million and $9 million for December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were 4 million euros and no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, under these credit facilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $2 million and $3 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. To the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. 61 Table of Contents
