Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe) (together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Non GAAP Financial Information Non GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP"). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, portions of this "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" include a comparison of certain non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, we are presenting information regarding changes in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 that exclude a non cash charge associated with the donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation (the Foundation), charges associated with litigation settlements and a catch up adjustment relating to cash award executive incentive plans (EIP) (collectively, the special items) as well as gross assessments excluding certain pricing modifications, because the Companys management believes that exclusion of this information facilitates understanding of our results of operations and provides meaningful comparison of results between periods. See Operating Expenses for a table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. In addition, the paragraph under the table provides operating expenses in 2004 excluding litigation settlements to provide a meaningful comparison between 2005 and 2004. Similarly, we present the effective tax rate with and without the impact of the stock donation to the MasterCard Foundation for the year ended December 31, 2006 because the stock donation to the Foundation is a non cash and non recurring item that was completed in conjunction with our change in governance and ownership structure implemented during the second quarter of 2006. The effective tax rate without the impact of the stock donation to the Foundation is more meaningful to investors in understanding our financial results, including comparability to the same periods in 2005. Overview We are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers credit, debit and related payment programs. We manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment card brands including MasterCard&reg;, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro&reg; and Cirrus&reg;, which we license to our customers. As part of managing these brands, we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. 43 Table of Contents We successfully completed our initial public offering (IPO) and implemented a new governance and ownership structure during the second quarter of 2006 (see Impact of the IPO below). We donated $395 million of our Class A common stock and $20 million in cash to the Foundation during 2006. We recorded net income of $50 million, or $.37 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $267 million or $1.98 per basic and diluted share in 2005. We achieved double digit revenue growth of 13.2% in 2006. Our revenue growth was moderated by a $341 million or 42.1% increase in rebates and incentives to our customers and merchants in the year ended December 31, 2006. The growth in revenues was principally due to increased transactions and volumes and restructuring of currency conversion pricing. In April 2006, we restructured our currency conversion pricing by initiating a charge to our issuers and acquirers for all cross border transactions regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for performing currency conversion. The restructuring of the currency conversion pricing and other less significant pricing modifications in 2006 accounted for approximately 3% of our revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006. Revenue growth was also impacted during the first three months of 2006 by certain other pricing changes that went into effect in April 2005. There was a negligible impact on revenues relating to a slightly unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation of the euro against the dollar. Operating expenses increased 21.7% in 2006. Excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in Operating Expenses, operating expenses increased 9.2% in the year ended December 31, 2006. Our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 93.1% in 2006 versus 86.6% in 2005. Excluding the impact of special items, our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved to 80.5% in 2006 from 83.4% in 2005. The increase in operating expenses, excluding the impact of special items in 2006, was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses to support our customer focused strategy and to a lesser extent an increase in advertising and marketing expenses to support our brand. Our liquidity and capital position were strong, as we had $2.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities, and $2.4 billion in stockholders equity as of December 31, 2006. We believe that the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Our strategy is to continue our growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry (such as corporate, premium and debit payments), enhancing our merchant relationships, maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs, brand marketing, product development, technology, processing and consulting services for these customers. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time, and in support of this strategy, we are continuing to hire additional resources and developing sales and other personnel. We intend to expand our role in targeted geographies by, among other things, pursuing incremental payment processing opportunities in the European region, Latin American and Asia/Pacific countries. There is increased regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees and other aspects of the payments industry which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we face exposure to antitrust and other types of litigation. Competition and pricing pressure within the global payments industry is increasing, due in part to consolidation within the banking sector and the growing power of merchants. Regulatory actions, litigation, and pricing pressure may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues. See Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report for these and other risks facing our business. 44 Table of Contents Impact of the IPO We completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure in the second quarter 2006, including the election of a new Board of Directors comprised of a majority of independent directors, establishment of an independent charitable foundation and completion of the IPO. Under the new ownership and governance structure, our previous stockholders retained a 41% equity interest in the company through ownership of new non voting Class B common stock. In addition, previous stockholders received a single share of Class M common stock that has no economic rights but provides certain voting rights, including the right to approve specified significant corporate actions and to elect up to three members of the MasterCard Board of Directors (but not more than one quarter of the total number of directors). We also issued 66,134,989 shares of a new voting Class A common stock to public investors through the IPO which closed in May 2006. These public investors hold shares representing approximately 49% of our equity and 83% of our general voting power. Additional shares of Class A common stock, representing approximately 10% of our equity and 17% of our voting rights, have been issued as a donation to The MasterCard Foundation, a charitable foundation incorporated in Canada (the Foundation). See Contribution Expense Foundation for additional information. We used all but $650 million of our net proceeds from the IPO (including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) to redeem a number of shares of Class B common stock from our previous stockholders that was equal to the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock that we issued to investors in the IPO (including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) and contributed to the Foundation. We intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital, defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges, expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes. We have not yet determined the specific amounts of all such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to each of these purposes. In addition, in connection with our new ownership and governance structure, we have adopted equity based compensation plans. We have converted certain of our existing long term incentive cash awards into equity based compensation awards under this plan. Due to this conversion, we are recognizing approximately $10 million of additional personnel expense, of which $8 million was recognized in 2006. The remaining personnel expense will be amortized based on the vesting within the plans. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors also approved 2006 awards under the equity based long term incentive plan. Additionally, we granted a one time restricted stock unit award to non executive management employees of approximately 440 thousand shares in total, which resulted in deferred stock based compensation equal to the fair value of the restricted stock units issued of approximately $17 million, which is being amortized over a three year vesting period. During 2006, we expensed $3 million. The remainder of the fair value, net of assumed forfeitures, is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the awards. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. In most regions except Europe, assessments are calculated based on local currency volume converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the related assessment period. In Europe, the local currency volumes are converted to the euro. As a result, assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar or euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period. In 2006 and 2005, the U.S. dollar weakened as evidenced by a 15.7% and 14.3% increase in gross dollar volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar converted basis, respectively, exceeded local currency GDV growth of 14.9% and 13.0%, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 45 Table of Contents We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar since the functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro. The strengthening or devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the euro impacts the translation of MasterCard Europes operating results into U.S. dollar amounts and is summarized as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Euro to U.S. dollar average exchange rate $ 1.26 $ 1.25 $ 1.24 Devaluation of U.S. dollar to euro from prior year (1 )% (1 )% (10 )% Revenue growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe revenues to U.S. dollars 2 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe expenses to U.S. dollars 2 % Revenues We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the GDV of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard branded cards. Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. We earned approximately 73.1%, 66.1% and 63.1% of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 26.9%, 33.9% and 36.9% of our net revenues from net assessments in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Approximately 3.3% of the shift to operation fees from assessments was due to the restructuring of the currency conversion pricing in 2006. Operations fees are typically transaction based for facilitating the processing of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCards system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders banks), acquirers (the merchants banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operations fees are as follows: Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholders transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to or from the issuer or, in certain circumstances, such as when the issuers systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuers instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. First, we clear a transaction by transferring the financial transaction details among issuers, acquirers or their designated third party processors. Then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers. We charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Switch fees are charges for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (MDS), our debit processing system. The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between members and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. 46 Table of Contents Currency conversion and cross border are volume based revenues. Cross border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different. We process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country borders for transactions. We can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchants local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer, who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholders statement in their own home currency. In April 2006, we restructured our currency conversion by initiating a charge to our issuers and acquirers for all cross border transaction volumes regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for performing currency conversion. Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S. based. Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. The methodology for calculating the transmission fees was changed in April 2005 so that they are based on the volume of information being transmitted through our systems and the number of connections to our systems. Prior to April 2005, these transmission fees were calculated solely based on the number and type of connections. Consulting and research fees as well as outsourcing services fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting, information and outsourcing services associated with our customers payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate research becoming a significant percentage of our business. MasterCard Advisors revenues, of which consulting and research fees are components, were less than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Other operations fees are primarily user pay services including the sale of manuals, publications, holograms, information and reports, as well as compliance programs and penalties, to assist our customers in managing their businesses. In addition, other operations fees include fees for cardholder services in connection with the benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Generally, we process the majority of MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. We process substantially all cross border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus branded cards. We charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement, authorization and switch fees on cross border transactions and earn cross border revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies. Operations fees for offline debit transactions, which are generally signature based debit transactions, are priced similar to credit transactions. Operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions, while international offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than international online debit transactions. Assessments are primarily based on GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate GDV. Assessment rates vary by region. Most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles. These assessment rates also vary by the type of transaction. We generally assess at higher rates for cross border volumes compared to domestic volumes. We also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals. Credit and offline debit 47 Table of Contents transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions. In addition, from time to time the Company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. In 2006 and 2005, gross revenues grew 19.5% and 21.1%, respectively. A component of our revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 was the result of restructuring currency conversion pricing in April 2006. Revenue growth was also impacted during the first three months of 2006 by certain other pricing changes that went into effect in April 2005. Our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance based support incentives. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 25.7%, 21.6% and 16.2% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry, the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers, the growing power of merchants and the impact of restructured pricing. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. The U.S. remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. Revenue generated in the U.S. was approximately 52.3%, 54.8% and 58.5% of total revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. Certain non U.S. economies have experienced more growth than the U.S. economy. Accordingly, some non U.S. revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2006 and 2005. The growth was not specifically related to any one region in which we do business. Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In the past, our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack because these events impact travel patterns and related cross border transaction volumes. Our revenues can also be impacted by a number of factors related to consumer behavior, including consumers confidence in the MasterCard brand. 48 Table of Contents Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In millions, except per share, percent and GDV amounts) Net operations fees $ 2,430 $ 1,941 $ 1,637 25.2 % 18.6 % Net assessments 896 997 956 (10.1 )% 4.3 % Total revenue 3,326 2,938 2,593 13.2 % 13.3 % General and administrative 1,505 1,352 1,186 11.4 % 13.9 % Advertising and marketing 1,052 1,008 916 4.3 % 10.1 % Litigation settlements 25 75 22 (66.8 )% 247.1 % Charitable contributions to the MasterCard Foundation 415 ** Depreciation and amortization 100 110 122 (9.2 )% (10.9 )% Total operating expenses 3,097 2,545 2,246 21.7 % 13.3 % Operating income 229 393 347 (41.6 )% 13.4 % Total other income (loss) 65 14 (23 ) 357.0 % 161.6 % Income before income tax expense 294 407 324 (27.8 )% 25.8 % Income tax expense 244 140 86 73.5 % 64.2 % Net income $ 50 $ 267 $ 238 (81.2 )% 12.0 % Net income per share (basic)1 $ .37 $ 1.98 $ 1.76 (81.3 )% 12.5 % Weighted average shares outstanding (basic)1 135 135 135 Net income per share (diluted)1 $ .37 $ 1.98 $ 1.76 (81.3 )% 12.5 % Weighted average shares outstanding (diluted)1 136 135 135 Effective income tax rate 82.9 %3 34.5 % 26.5 % ** ** Gross dollar volume (GDV) on a US dollar converted basis (in billions) 1,956 1,690 1,478 15.7 % 14.3 % Processed transactions2 16,137 13,733 12,152 17.5 % 13.0 % ** Not Meaningful, See Operating Expenses and Income Taxes for more information.  1 As more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, in connection with the ownership and governance transactions, we reclassified all of our approximately 100 outstanding shares of existing Class A redeemable common stock so that our previous stockholders received 1.35 shares of our Class B common stock for each share of Class A redeemable common stock that they held prior to the reclassification and a single share of our Class M common stock. Accordingly, shares and per share data were retroactively restated in the financial statements subsequent to the reclassification to reflect the reclassification as if it were effective at the start of the first period being presented in the financial statements. 2 The data set forth for processed transactions represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN based online debit transactions. Prior to 2005, processed transactions reported by MasterCard included certain MasterCard branded (excluding Maestro and Cirrus) transactions for which we received transaction details from our customers but which were not processed by our systems. In the first quarter of 2006, we updated our transaction detail to remove online balance inquiry transactions as well as online transactions which were declined for various reasons. Management determined that it would be more appropriate to exclude such transactions from the processed transactions calculation. The processed transactions for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 have been restated to be consistent with the calculation of processed transactions in 2006. Revenue has not been impacted by this change. 3 The effective tax rate includes the impact of a $395 million stock charitable contribution which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Income Taxes for more information. 49 Table of Contents Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions, except percents) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,169 $ 1,055 $ 913 $ 114 $ 142 10.8 % 15.6 % Currency conversion and cross border 622 317 281 305 36 96.2 % 12.8 % Acceptance development fees 217 171 85 46 86 26.9 % 101.2 % Warning bulletin fees 70 70 66 4 6.1 % Connectivity 84 63 35 21 28 33.3 % 80.0 % Consulting and research fees 76 63 38 13 25 20.6 % 65.8 % Other operations fees 449 378 337 71 41 18.8 % 12.2 % Gross operations fees 2,687 2,117 1,755 570 362 26.9 % 20.6 % Rebates (257 ) (176 ) (118 ) (81 ) (58 ) 46.0 % 49.2 % Net operations fees $ 2,430 $ 1,941 $ 1,637 $ 489 $ 304 25.2 % 18.6 % Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems, increasing 17.5% and 13.0% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Offsetting the 2006 increase in growth was a 3.0% reduction of revenues due to the implementation of price changes in April 2006 to make our pricing compliant with the Single European Payment Area (SEPA) initiative. The SEPA price changes are slightly positive on a total gross revenue basis; however, these changes impact individual revenue categories, in particular authorization, settlement and switch, currency conversion and cross border revenues and assessments. In 2006 and 2005, a portion of the revenue increases were also due to the pricing of a component of these revenues being restructured in April 2005. In addition, settlement revenue declined $15 million in 2006 and $2 million in 2005 relating to a decline in foreign exchange gains on settlement activities. MasterCard trading against the U.S. dollar instead of the euro beginning in May 2005 coupled with exchange rate volatility resulted in this impact to settlement revenue. Currency conversion and cross border revenues increased $305 million, or 96.2%, in 2006. This increase was primarily due to the restructuring of currency conversion pricing in April 2006. We restructured our currency conversion pricing by initiating a charge to our issuers, and in most regions, acquirers for all cross border transactions regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for currency conversion. Of the increase in 2006, $108 million was due to the reclassification of certain assessment revenues in our Europe region to cross border volume revenue. In addition to the restructuring of these revenues, there was an increase in cross border transaction volumes of 14.7% in 2006. Acceptance development fees increased in 2006 due to increased volumes and to a lesser extent the impact of the implementation of new fees and increases on the pricing of existing fees which occurred in April 2005. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to the pricing change in April 2005. Warning bulletin fees fluctuate with our customer requests for distribution of invalid account information. Connectivity revenues increased in 2006 due to increased volumes and to a lesser extent the impact of the implementation of new fees and increases on the pricing of existing fees which occurred in April 2005. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to the pricing change in April 2005. Consulting and research fees increased primarily due to new engagements with our customers in 2006 and 2005. Our business agreements with certain customers may include consulting services as an incentive. Approximately 36.9% of consulting and research fees in 2006 was generated by new engagements which were provided to customers as a component of incentive agreements compared to 14.2% in 2005. This type of incentive increases consulting fees and reduces assessments. 50 Table of Contents Other operations fees relate to various revenue streams including cardholder services (emergency services and card enhancements), compliance and penalty fees, holograms, user pay for a variety of transaction enhancement services, and manuals and publications. Of the increase in 2006, $13 million was due to increased revenues from cardholder services due to account growth, $8 million was due to an increase in fees from transactions accepted by U.S. acquirers from cardholders with non U.S. issuers and $7 million for fees due to increased usage of our electronic image processing program which routes document images between customers. The change in any other individual revenue component was not material in 2006 and 2005. Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates have been increasing due to renewals of customer agreements, ongoing consolidation of our customers and the impact of restructured pricing. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 9.6%, 8.3% and 6.7% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In millions, except percents) Gross assessments $ 1,790 $ 1,631 $ 1,341 $ 159 $ 290 9.7 % 21.6 % Rebates and incentives (894 ) (634 ) (385 ) (260 ) (249 ) 41.0 % 64.7 % Net assessments $ 896 $ 997 $ 956 $ (101 ) $ 41 (10.1 )% 4.3 % GDV growth was 14.9% and 13.0% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, when measured in local currency terms, and 15.7% and 14.3% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. A portion of our GDV growth relates to an increase in online debit transactions which are priced at a lower assessment rate compared to credit and offline debit transactions. Accordingly, assessments are increasing at a lower rate than GDV. Rebates and incentives provided to customers and merchants reduce assessments growth. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 49.9%, 38.9% and 28.7% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Rebates and incentives are primarily based on GDV, and may also contain fixed components for the issuance of new cards, launch of marketing programs or consulting services. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the increase in the percentage of rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments was the result of new or revised pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants. In addition, during 2006 we provided significant incentives to support the conversion of a large payment card program to MasterCard. Assessments were also impacted in 2006 by a reclassification of $108 million from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues, offset by $33 million in pricing increases related to our SEPA pricing changes. Our gross assessments would have increased 14.3% in 2006 if these pricing modifications were not made in April 2006. In 2005 and 2004, assessments grew due to an increase in assessments for marketing programs and other specific purposes. We introduced new or increased assessments for market development programs in specific countries or regions within Europe and Latin America. In 2005, offsetting a portion of the increase in assessments was the elimination of an assessment for the promotion of soccer events in the European region, which became a component of the core assessment rates in 2005. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements, contributions to the Foundation and depreciation and 51 Table of Contents amortization expenses. In 2006, there was an increase in operating expenses of $552 million, or 21.7% compared to 2005. As described above, the following table shows a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items and as adjusted to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which management believes creates a more meaningful comparison of results between periods: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 Actual SpecialItems AsAdjusted Actual SpecialItems AsAdjusted PercentIncrease (Decrease) Actual PercentIncrease (Decrease) As Adjusted (In millions, except percents) General and administrative $ 1,505 $ $ 1,505 $ 1,352 19 a 1,333 11.4 % 13.0 % Advertising and marketing 1,052 1,052 1,008 1,008 4.3 % 4.3 % Litigation settlements 25 25 75 75 (66.8 )% Charitable contributions 415 395 b 20 Depreciation and amortization 100 100 110 110 (9.2 )% (9.2 )% Total operating expenses $ 3,097 $ 420 $ 2,677 $ 2,545 94 2,451 21.7 % 9.2 % Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues 93.1 % 80.5 % 86.6 % 83.4 % a Adjustment to reflect accounting methodology change for cash based executive incentive plans b Contribution of stock to the MasterCard Foundation In 2005, there was an increase in operating expenses of $298 million, or 13.3% compared to 2004. During 2004, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 86.6% including one special item for litigation settlements of $22 million. Excluding the impact of litigation settlements in 2004, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 85.8% and the as adjusted increase in operating expenses was $225 million or 10.1% in 2005 from 2004. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications and travel. The major components of general and administrative expenses were as follows: For the years ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 2006 2005 (In millions, except percents) Personnel $ 966 $ 890 $ 741 $ 76 $ 149 8.5 % 20.1 % Professional fees 180 135 130 45 5 33.3 % 3.8 % Telecommunications 70 71 74 (1 ) (3 ) (1.4 )% (4.1 )% Data processing 59 62 59 (3 ) 3 (4.8 )% 5.1 % Travel 97 84 66 13 18 15.5 % 27.3 % Other 133 110 116 23 (6 ) 20.9 % (5.2 )% General and administrative expenses $ 1,505 $ 1,352 $ 1,186 $ 153 $ 166 11.3 % 14.0 % 52 Table of Contents Personnel consists of employee compensation, benefits, training, recruiting and severance costs, as well as contractor and temporary personnel costs. Personnel increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to hiring additional staff to support our strategic initiatives. As we continue to expand our customer focused approach and expand our relationships with merchants, additional personnel are required. In addition, we provided higher performance awards, as a result of the additional staff and better than anticipated performance against company objectives. In 2005, the following two items increased personnel expense and therefore, partially offset the increase in 2006: Changing our methodology of recognizing the cost of executive incentive cash award plans, which resulted in a catch up adjustment of $19 million. Updating the assumptions for our actuarial determined severance plan accrual which resulted in higher severance costs of $20 million. This increase was partially offset by a $7 million reduction versus 2004 in the expense for actual severed employees. Professional fees consist of expenses for consulting, legal, accounting and tax services. Professional fees increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and consulting services used to execute our strategy. Additionally, in 2005, consulting services and audit fees also increased relating to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Telecommunications expense consists of costs to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with system changes, maintenance and usage. Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly have increased with the corresponding increase in our business activity as well as due to increased travel around 2006 World Cup soccer related activities. Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. Advertising and Marketing Advertising and marketing consists of expenses associated with advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands. Advertising and market development expenses increased $44 million or 4.3% in 2006 and increased $92 million or 10.1% in 2005. MasterCard was a sponsor of the 2006 World Cup soccer events. To fully capitalize on this valuable sponsorship, we devoted a significant amount of resources for the sponsorship fee, special programming, promotions and event marketing during 2006. Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets. Our approach to marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated package designed to increase MasterCard brand awareness, as well as preference and usage of MasterCard cards. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Litigation Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was 53 Table of Contents subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors. We are also a party to a number of currency conversion litigations. Based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these currency conversion cases and pursuant to Statement of Financial Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we have recorded reserves in the aggregate amount of $89 million of which $73 million was paid in 2006. In connection with the settlement of certain other litigations, we recorded additional reserves of $25 million of which $23 million was paid in 2006. Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements changed as follows (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2004 $ 598 Litigation reserve for potential settlement of currency conversion litigations 75 Interest accretion on U.S. merchant lawsuit 47 Payments (115 ) Balance as of December 31, 2005 605 Reserve for litigation settlements 25 Interest accretion on U.S. merchant lawsuit 43 Payments (196 ) Balance as of December 31, 2006 $ 477 Contribution Expense Foundation At the time of the IPO, we issued 13,496,933 shares of our Class A common stock as a donation to the Foundation that is incorporated in Canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our members. The Foundation will build on MasterCards existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education, understand and utilize technology, and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force. In addition, the Foundation will support organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities in order to enhance local economies and develop entrepreneurs. In connection with the donation of the Class A common stock, we recorded an expense of $395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated. The value of the shares of Class A common stock we donated was determined based on the IPO price per share of Class A common stock in the IPO less a marketability discount of 25%. This marketability discount and the methodology used to quantify it were determined by management in consultation with independent valuation consultants retained by MasterCard. This discount was calculated based on analyses of prices paid in transactions of restricted stock of publicly held companies and on income based analyses. At the time of the IPO, we expected to donate approximately $40 million in cash to the Foundation over a period of up to four years in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations, and we may make additional cash contributions to the Foundation during and after this period. In 2006, we recorded a $20 million expense for cash donations we made to the Foundation. Under the terms of the contributions to the Foundation, these donations are generally not deductible by MasterCard for tax purposes. As a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations, there was a significant increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. We also expect to record an expense equal to the value of any cash we donate in the period or periods in which any such donations are made. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $10 million and $13 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. These decreases were primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. 54 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. Investment income increased $64 million in 2006 and $12 million in 2005. The increase in 2006 is primarily driven by interest income from higher cash and short term investment balances principally relating to the proceeds received from the IPO, increases in interest rates and dividends received. The interest earned on the IPO proceeds ultimately used for the stock redemption was approximately $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates. Interest expense decreased $9 million in 2006 and remained unchanged in 2005 from 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2006, $4 million of the reduction in expense was due to a refund of interest assessed in an audit of the Companys federal income tax return, as well as the reduction of interest reserve requirements related to the Companys tax reserves, resulting from the reassessment of such reserves. In addition, $4 million was due to lower interest accretion relating to the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. Other gains and losses decreased in 2006 primarily due to a $17 million settlement the Company received in resolution of a dispute of a customer business agreement and $9 million in gains relating to the sale of two affiliated investments in 2005. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of the $395 charitable contribution of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation. This contribution was recorded as an expense in the income statement, however, it is not deductible for tax purposes. This resulted in a significant impact on our effective tax rate as follows: GAAPActual GAAP Effective Tax Rate StockDonation Non GAAPAdjusted Non GAAP Effective Tax Rate (In millions, except percents) Twelve months ended December 31, 2006: Income before income taxes $ 294 82.9 % $ 395 $ 689 35.4 % Income tax expense1 244 244 Net Income $ 50 $ 445 1 Income tax expense has been calculated with and without the impact of the stock contribution to the Foundation. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 82.9%, 34.5% and 26.5%, respectively. The rate in 2006 was higher than 2005 primarily due to the nondeductible charitable contribution of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation during the second quarter of 2006. MasterCard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of Class A common stock we donated to the Foundation. Under the terms of the contribution to the Foundation, this contribution is generally not deductible by MasterCard for tax purposes. This transaction is discussed in more detail in the section under the heading Impact of the IPO. Accordingly, as a result of the significant difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donation, the calculation of an effective tax rate for the 2006 period is not meaningful. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2005 as compared to 2004 was attributable to the settlement and reassessment, during 2004, of various tax audit issues discussed below. 55 Table of Contents The components impacting the effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Dollar Amount Percent Dollar Amount Percent Dollar Amount Percent (In millions, except percents) Income before income tax expense $ 294 $ 407 $ 324 Federal statutory tax $ 103 35.0 % $ 143 35.0 % $ 113 35.0 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit 6 1.8 % 4 0.9 % 4 1.3 % Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit (6 ) (1.9 )% 5 1.1 % 4 1.2 % Non deductible charitable stock contribution 138 47.0 % Non deductible expenses and other differences 13 4.4 % (2 ) (0.3 )% 4 1.0 % Tax exempt income (10 ) (3.4 )% (8 ) (2.0 )% (7 ) (2.1 )% Adjustment to deferred tax for change in U.S. state tax rate (8 ) (2.6 )% Refund claims and settlement of audit matters: United States 1 0.3 % (11 ) (3.4 )% Foreign (2 ) (0.5 )% (13 ) (3.9 )% Income tax expense $ 244 82.9 % $ 141 34.5 % $ 86 26.5 % Liquidity We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $2.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities with which to manage operations. We expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs for the next twelve months. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Item 1A Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. See also Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

In 2006, the increase in cash from operations was due to stronger operating performance, higher accounts payable and customer and merchant incentive accruals, partially offset by higher payments for litigation and customer and merchant incentive prepayments. In 2005, the decrease 56 Table of Contents in cash provided by operating activities was due to a $40 million voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plan as well as higher income tax payments and prepayments made in accordance with new customer incentive agreements. These cash outflows in 2005 were offset by stronger operating performance versus 2004 and an increase in accruals for personnel costs associated with the Companys employee incentive and severance plans. The use of cash from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to net purchases of available for sale securities and our investment on the internal development of capitalized software to support our business. Additionally, in 2005, we acquired certain businesses and invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchases of fixed assets to support our business. The net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2006 as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of Class A common stock to investors in the IPO (including the proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) of approximately $2.5 billion, which was offset by $1.8 billion for the redemption of Class B common stock and a $12 million dividend payment. Under the terms of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement, we are required to pay $100 million annually each December through the year 2012. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we made payments of $96 million and $15 million for currency conversion litigation and other litigation settlements. On April 28, 2006, we entered into a committed 3 year unsecured $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with certain financial institutions. The Credit Facility, which expires on April 28, 2009, replaced our prior $2.25 billion credit facility, which was to expire on June 16, 2006. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers and, subject to a limit of $500 million, for general corporate purposes. The facility fee and borrowing cost are contingent upon our credit rating. At our current rating, we pay a facility fee of 8 basis points on the total commitment, or $2 million annually. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin of 37 basis points (the LIBOR margin) or an alternative base rate. A utilization fee of 10 basis points would be charged if outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of commitments. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2006. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2006 or the previous facility at December 31, 2005. The majority of the Credit Facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard International. Following the announcement of our planned ownership and governance changes, Standard & Poors placed our credit ratings on credit watch with negative implications and announced the intention to lower our long term counterparty credit rating from A to BBB+ and our subordinated debt rating from BBB+ to BBB, both with stable outlook, upon completion of the IPO. On May 25, 2006 these rating changes took effect. The change in our long term counterparty rating resulted in an increase in the facility fee on the Credit Facility from 7 to 8 basis points, or $250 thousand annually. Additionally, the LIBOR margin increased from 28 to 37 basis points. We do not expect these rating changes to materially impact our liquidity or access to capital. MasterCard Europe and European Payment System Services sprl, a subsidiary of MasterCard, have a 1 million euro overdraft facility. There is also a 1 million euro guarantee facility for MasterCard Europe. Interest on borrowings under the overdraft facility is charged at 50 basis points over the relevant market index and interest for the guarantee facility is paid at a rate of 1.5% per annum on outstanding guarantees. There were no borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005. However, the euro guarantee facility supported bank issued guarantees for a total of 849 thousand euros and 810 thousand euros, for the respective periods, which reduced the amount of funds available under this facility. Deutsche Bank AG is the lender of these facilities and is a customer and member of MasterCard International. MasterCard Europe has one additional uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros. The interest rate under this facility is Euro LIBOR plus 50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100 million 57 Table of Contents euros and Euro LIBOR plus 250 basis points for amounts over the 100 million euro limit. For drawings in currencies other than the euro, interest will be charged at the above margins over the relevant currency base rate. There were no material borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2006 and 2005. HSBC Bank plc is the lender of this facility and is a customer and member of MasterCard International. In September and December 2006, MasterCards Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends, each at $0.09 per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The September dividend was paid on November 10, 2006 and was for an aggregate amount of $12 million. The December dividend was paid on February 9, 2007 and was for an aggregate amount of $12 million. On February 6, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on May 10, 2007 to holders of record on April 9, 2007of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount payable for this dividend is estimated to be approximately $21 million. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs. Future Obligations The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2006 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 andthereafter (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 62 $ 9 $ 10 $ 4 $ 39 Operating leases2 96 32 47 8 9 Sponsorship3, licensing & other4 913 413 297 113 90 Litigation settlements5 617 117 200 200 100 Debt6 237 5 232 Executive incentive plan benefit7 36 36 Total $ 1,961 $ 612 $ 786 $ 325 $ 238 1 Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co processing facility. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Includes $180 million as of December 31, 2006 relating to a sponsorship agreement which is the subject of a legal dispute and which we may not be obligated to pay. 4 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $387 million as of December 31, 2006 related to customer and merchant agreements. 5 Represents amounts due in accordance with the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements. 58 Table of Contents 6 Debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and the principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes due September 2009. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2006 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. 7 Represents Executive Incentive Plan and the Senior Executive Incentive Plan cash payments due to employees should they terminate employment. Related Parties A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2006, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.1 billion, or 34% of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Seasonality Portions of our business are seasonal. Our gross revenue is favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period. However, customer and merchant incentives, which are recorded as contra revenue, and advertising, holiday promotions and incentives also increase generally causing our profitability to decline in the fourth quarter. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. 59 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Revenue Recognition Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Total assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for 26%, 15% and 11% of those assessment revenues, representing 7%, 5% and 4% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 18 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 60 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement We have entered into a settlement agreement in connection with the U.S. merchant lawsuit. This settlement was discounted over the ten year payment term of the settlement. We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement in 2003 to be 8%. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A one percent increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2006, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a one percent decrease in the discount rate. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (except Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. The test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on managements judgment using internal and external data. We utilize independent valuation experts, if needed. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $414 million, including $192 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2006. We determined customer relationships, an intangible asset, have an indefinite life. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein, and no significant impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. 61 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset in excess of the net deferred tax asset or if we were unable to realize a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. If actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2006 was $75 million. On a quarterly basis, we perform impairment analyses on various technologies. If the carrying value of the various technologies exceeds the fair value, impairment charges are recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2006, no significant impairment charges were recorded. 62 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Pensions and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. This pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits based on each participants account balance. Additionally, the Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by U.S. tax laws. The Company also maintains a postretirement plan providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its U.S. employees and retirees. Certain assumptions are used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans projected benefit obligation for pension and postretirement, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan. The discount rate for the Companys pension and postretirement plans is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows (determined on PBO basis) with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. Our discount rate of 5.75% as of December 31, 2006 is 25 basis points greater than the 5.50% rate used in calculating the net periodic benefit costs for 2005. Net actuarial gains and or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans. We determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets. The expected rate of our pension plan assets is 8.5% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our pension projected benefit obligation by $1.6 million, and increase our postretirement projected benefit obligation by $2.0 million. These decreases would have a negligible effect on our annual pension and postretirement expense. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.5 million. A complete analysis of the cost impact resulting from a change in this assumption is fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Report. 63 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Postemployment Benefit Plan We have a formal severance plan which sets forth the guidelines with respect to severance payments to salaried employees whose normal assignment is within the United States. Approximately 3,100 of our employees are covered by the Plan. Severance benefits are determined primarily by years of service and career level in accordance with either a standard or enhanced payment schedule, which is determined by the cause of the severance action. Certain assumptions are used in the determination of the liability for expected future severance obligations. Key assumptions include the number of severed participants, number of severed individuals by career level, benefit package and discount rate. The assumption for the number of severed participants used in the calculation was 120 for 2006 and 100 for 2005. The career levels for these individuals was estimated using historical experience as a base, adjusted for a number of strategic and human resource initiatives implemented in 2006 and 2005. We review historical trends and future expectations when determining the type of benefits to be offered to the severed participants. The discount rate for our postemployment plan is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. Our discount rate of 5.50% as of December 31, 2006 is 25 basis points less than the 5.75% rate used in calculating the severance obligations for 2005. A 5% increase in the number of severed participants would increase our severance obligations by $1.7 million. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a 5% decrease in the number of participants. A quarter of a percentage point decrease or increase in our discount rate would have an impact of approximately $0.4 million on our severance obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. FIN 48 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We expect the adoption of FIN 48 will increase other liabilities by approximately $5 million to $10 million and decrease retained earnings by the same amount. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by 64 Table of Contents the board of directors, governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $35 million and $78 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $17 million and $33 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2006 and 2005 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $2 million and $4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of $121 million and $218 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $45 million and $39 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2006 and 2005 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $7 million and $16 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, forward currency contracts against the Brazilian real were purchased (with notional amounts of $11 million). Based on the year end 2006 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the Brazilian real is estimated to create a loss valued at $1 million. Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of nineteen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $22 million and $19 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our held to maturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in a fair value loss of $2 million and $5 million for December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Report. 65 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were 3 million euros and 5 million euros outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, under these credit facilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Report. Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $1 million and $2 million in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. To the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. 66 Table of Contents
