Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe) (together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Non GAAP Financial Information Non GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, portions of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include a comparison of certain non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Companys management believes that the non GAAP financial measures discussed below facilitate an understanding of our results of operations and provide a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods. Specifically, we are presenting operating expenses excluding: Litigation settlements in 2007; Non cash charge associated with the donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation and litigation settlements in 2006; and Catch up adjustment relating to cash award executive incentive plans and litigation settlements in 2005. See Operating Expenses for a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding the special items above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Similarly, we present the effective tax rate with and without the impact of the stock donation to The MasterCard Foundation (the Foundation) for the year ended December 31, 2006 because the stock donation to the Foundation is a non cash and non recurring item that was completed in conjunction with our change in governance and ownership structure implemented during the second quarter of 2006. We believe the effective tax rate without the impact of the stock donation to the Foundation is more meaningful to investors in understanding our financial results, including comparability to the same periods in 2007 and 2005. Finally, we are presenting in 2007 and 2006 gross assessments growth excluding a reclassification from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues and SEPA pricing increases. We believe the gross assessments growth rate excluding these items is representative of the core growth in these revenues. Overview We are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers credit, debit and related payment programs. We manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment card brands including MasterCard&reg;, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro&reg; and Cirrus&reg;, which we license to our customers. As part of managing these brands, we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. 45 Table of Contents We recorded net income of $1.1 billion, or $8.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus $50 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in 2006. Our liquidity and capital position remain strong, with $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities and $3.0 billion in stockholders equity as of December 31, 2007. Net revenue growth of 22.3% in 2007 was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes. The foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the Brazilian real against the dollar accounted for 3.1% of the growth while approximately 2% of our 2007 net revenue growth was due to the impact of pricing adjustments. Operating expenses decreased 4.4% in 2007. This decrease in operating expenses includes a 1.8% favorable impact for the foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in Operating Expenses, operating expenses increased 10.4% in the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2007, the increase in operating expenses, excluding the impact of special items, was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses to support our customer focused strategy. Our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 72.8% in 2007 versus 93.1% in 2006. Excluding the impact of special items, our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues in 2007 declined to 72.7% from 80.5% in 2006. Other income in 2007 includes realized gains of approximately $391 million for the partial sale of an available for sale security, Redecard S.A. and $90 million from the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events in resolution of all outstanding disputes pertaining to our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See Other Income (Expense). Regulatory actions, litigation, consolidation within the banking industry and the growing power of merchants may lead us to change our pricing arrangements, reducing our overall revenues and having an adverse impact on our business. See Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report for these and other risks facing our business. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as cards, creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Our strategy is to continue our growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry (such as premium/affluent and contactless cards, commercial payments and debit), enhancing our merchant relationships, growing acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world. We are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs, marketing, product development, technology, processing, consulting and information services. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. In most regions except Europe, assessments are calculated based on local currency volume converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the related assessment period. In Europe, the local currency volumes are converted to the euro. As a result, assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar or euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period. In 2007 and 2006, gross dollar volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar converted basis increased 18.4% and 16.1%, respectively, exceeding local currency GDV growth of 14.4% and 15.4%, compared to the same periods in the prior year, indicating the weakening of the U.S. dollar. We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar since the functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. The strengthening or devaluation of the 46 Table of Contents U.S. dollar against the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the U.S. dollar. The impact on operating results for each of the years stated is summarized as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Revenue growth attributable to translation of euro and real revenues to U.S. dollars 3.1 % 0.5 % 0.5 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of euro and real expenses to U.S. dollars 1.8 % 0.5 % 0.4 % Revenues We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the GDV of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard branded cards. Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. We review our pricing and implement changes on an ongoing basis. In addition, standard pricing varies by region and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. We earned approximately 73.8%, 73.1% and 66.1% of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 26.2%, 26.9% and 33.9% of our net revenues from net assessments in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 3.3% of the shift to operation fees from assessments in 2006 was due to the restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in April 2006. Operations fees are typically transaction based but may also be volume based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCards system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders banks), acquirers (the merchants banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operations fees are as follows: Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholders transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to or from the issuer or, in certain circumstances, such as when the issuers systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuers instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. First, we clear a transaction by transferring the financial transaction details among issuers, acquirers or their designated third party processors. Then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers. We charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Switch fees are charges for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (the MDS), our debit processing system. The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Currency conversion and cross border are volume based revenues. Cross border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different. We have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country 47 Table of Contents borders. We can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchants local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer, who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholders statement in their own home currency. In April 2006, we restructured our currency conversion by initiating a charge to our issuers and acquirers for all cross border transaction volumes regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for performing currency conversion. Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S. based. Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting and research services associated with our customers payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate consulting and research fees becoming a significant percentage of our business. Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, fees for U.S. acquirers accepting transactions from cardholders with non U.S. issuers, compliance and penalty fees, holograms and publications. Cardholder services are benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Generally, we process the majority of MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. We process substantially all cross border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus branded cards. We charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement, authorization and switch fees on cross border transactions and earn cross border revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies. Operations fees for offline debit transactions, which are generally signature based debit transactions, are priced similar to credit transactions. Operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions, while cross border offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than cross border online debit transactions. Assessments are primarily based on a customers GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate GDV. Most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles. These assessment rates also vary by the type of transaction. We generally assess at higher rates for cross border volumes compared to domestic volumes. We also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals. Credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions. In addition, from time to time we may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. In 2007 and 2006, gross revenues grew 20.4% and 19.5%, respectively. A component of our revenue growth in each year is attributable to pricing changes. Our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance 48 Table of Contents based support incentives. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 24.6%, 25.7% and 21.6% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Rebates and incentives increased $173 million, or 15.0%, and $341 million, or 42.1%, in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These increases reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry, the continued consolidation and globalization of our customers, the growing power of merchants and the impact of pricing changes. The United States remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. Revenue generated in the United States was approximately 49.7%, 52.3% and 54.8% of total revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. Certain non U.S. economies have experienced stronger growth than the U.S. economy. Accordingly, some non U.S. revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2007 and 2006. The growth was not specifically related to any one region in which we do business. Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In particular, a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on international travel patterns; which can vary with the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies or the impact of specific events, such as terrorist attacks. Our revenues can also be impacted by a number of factors related to consumer behavior, including consumer confidence in the MasterCard brand.

Accordingly, shares and per share data were retroactively restated in the financial statements subsequent to the reclassification to reflect the reclassification as if it were effective at the start of the first period being presented in the financial statements. 2 The 2006 effective tax rate includes the impact of a $395 million donation of shares of Class A common stock to the Foundation, a charitable contribution which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Income Taxes for more information. 3 In 2007, we updated GDV to exclude commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for 2006 and 2005 have been restated to be consistent with this approach. 4 The data set forth for processed transactions represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN based online debit transactions. In 2006, we updated our transaction detail to remove certain online debit transactions which did not result in a flow of funds, for example balance inquiry or failed transactions. Management determined that it would be more appropriate to exclude such transactions from the processed transactions calculation. The processed transactions in 2005 have been restated to be consistent with the calculation of processed transactions in 2006. Revenue has not been impacted by this change. Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions, except percents) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,382 $ 1,169 $ 1,055 $ 213 $ 114 18.2 % 10.8 % Currency conversion and cross border 868 622 317 246 305 39.5 % 96.2 % Acceptance development fees 271 217 171 54 46 24.9 % 26.9 % Warning bulletin fees 74 70 70 4 5.7 % Connectivity 101 84 63 17 21 20.2 % 33.3 % Consulting and research fees 88 76 63 12 13 15.8 % 20.6 % Other operations fees 551 449 378 102 71 22.7 % 18.8 % Gross operations fees 3,335 2,687 2,117 648 570 24.1 % 26.9 % Rebates (332 ) (257 ) (176 ) (75 ) (81 ) 29.2 % 46.0 % Net operations fees $ 3,003 $ 2,430 $ 1,941 $ 573 $ 489 23.6 % 25.2 % Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems, increasing 16.2% and 17.5% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, approximately 2% of this increase in revenue was attributable to higher utilization and pricing increases for stand in authorization services. Stand in occurs when the issuers primary authorization routing options fail and MasterCard approves the requests on behalf of the issuer based on pre defined issuer parameters. These increases in revenues were partially offset in 2007 and 2006 by 0.9% and 3.0%, respectively, due to the implementation of price changes in April 2006 to make our pricing compliant with the Single European Payment Area (SEPA) initiative. The SEPA price changes were slightly positive on a total gross revenue basis; however, these changes impact individual revenue categories, in particular authorization, settlement 50 Table of Contents and switch, currency conversion and cross border revenues and assessments. In addition, settlement revenue increased $3 million in 2007 and declined $15 million in 2006 relating to foreign exchange gains due to exchange rate volatility on settlement activities. Currency conversion and cross border revenues increased due to an increase in cross border volumes of 21.1% and 14.7% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and due to the restructuring of currency conversion pricing in April 2006. We restructured our currency conversion pricing by initiating a charge to our issuers, and, in most regions, acquirers for all cross border transactions regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for currency conversion. Of the increases, $31 million and $108 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, were due to the reclassification of certain assessment revenues in Europe to cross border volume revenue. Acceptance development fees increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to increased volumes and the introduction of a new fee. The new fee was implemented in June 2007 which resulted in a 7.5% increase in acceptance development fees in 2007 compared to 2006. In addition, we began an exclusivity relationship with one merchant in the fourth quarter of 2006 that increased transaction volumes and accordingly, acceptance development fees by 3.1% in 2007. Warning bulletin fees fluctuate with our customer requests for distribution of invalid or fraudulent account information. Connectivity revenues increased due to increased volumes. Consulting and research fees increased, primarily due to new engagements with our customers in 2007 and 2006. Our business agreements with certain customers may include consulting services as an incentive. Approximately 38.2% of consulting and research fees in 2007, as compared to 36.9% in 2006, were generated by new engagements which were provided to customers as a component of incentive agreements. This type of incentive increases consulting fees and reduces assessments. Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, compliance and penalty fees, holograms, user pay for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, and manuals and publications. No increase in any component of other operations fees was material, other than the following: &shy; Implementation of a new account enhancement program which resulted in an increase of $24 million in 2007. &shy; Transactions from U.S. acquirers with non U.S. issuers increased, accordingly, revenue from these transactions increased by $16 million and $8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. &shy; Cardholder services increased $7 million and $13 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to an increase in account growth. Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates have been increasing due to renewals of customer agreements, ongoing consolidation of our customers and the impact of restructured pricing. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 10.0%, 9.6% and 8.3% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions, except percents) Gross assessments $ 2,056 $ 1,790 $ 1,631 $ 266 $ 159 14.9 % 9.7 % Rebates and incentives (992 ) (894 ) (634 ) (98 ) (260 ) 11.0 % 41.0 % Net assessments $ 1,064 $ 896 $ 997 $ 168 $ (101 ) 18.8 % (10.1 )% 51 Table of Contents GDV growth was 14.4% and 15.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, when measured in local currency terms, and 18.4% and 16.1% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. In 2007, gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within Europe. In 2006, a portion of our GDV growth related to an increase in online debit transactions which are priced at a lower assessment rate compared to credit and offline debit transactions. Accordingly, gross assessments in 2006 increased at a lower rate than GDV. In addition, revenue growth rates in 2007 and 2006 were impacted by a reclassification of $31 million and $108 million, respectively, from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues, offset by $12 million and $33 million, respectively, in pricing increases related to our SEPA pricing changes. The increase in 2007 and 2006 gross assessments, excluding the net impact of the reclassifications and increase from the April 2006 pricing modifications from each period, would have been 11.3% and 14.3%, respectively. Rebates and incentives are primarily based on GDV but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. The rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 48.2%, 49.9% and 38.9% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As gross assessments increase at a faster rate than rebates and incentives, the ratio of rebates and incentives to gross assessments will decline. Non GDV performance based incentives vary depending on the agreement terms and the timing of our customers performance. Accordingly, our incentives for non GDV performance metrics, such as the issuance of new cards, the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs, impact the relationship between gross assessments and net assessments. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements, contributions to the Foundation and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2007, there was a decrease in operating expenses of $137 million, or 4.4% compared to 2006. As described above, the following table shows a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items and as adjusted to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which management believes creates a more meaningful comparison of results between periods: For the twelve months endedDecember 31, 2007 For the twelve months endedDecember 31, 2006 Actual SpecialItems Non GAAP Actual SpecialItems Non GAAP PercentIncrease(Decrease)Actual PercentIncrease(Decrease)As Adjusted (In millions, except percents) General and Administrative $ 1,758 $ $ 1,758 $ 1,505 $ $ 1,505 16.8 % 16.8 % Advertising and Marketing 1,080 1,080 1,052 1,052 2.7 % 2.7 % Litigation Settlements 3 (3 ) 25 (25 ) (86.4 )% Charitable Contributions 20 20 415 (395 )1 20 (95.2 )% Depreciation and Amortization 98 98 100 100 (2.1 )% (2.1 )% Total operating expenses $ 2,959 $ (3 ) $ 2,956 $ 3,097 $ (420 ) $ 2,677 (4.4 )% 10.4 % Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues 72.8 % 72.7 % 93.1 % 80.5 % 1 Contribution of stock to the MasterCard Foundation 52 Table of Contents In 2006, there was an increase in operating expenses of $552 million, or 21.7% compared to 2005. During 2005, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 86.6%, including two special items of litigation settlements for $75 million and $19 million for an adjustment to reflect our accounting methodology change for cash based executive incentive plans. Excluding the two special items in 2005, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 83.4% and the as adjusted increase in operating expenses was $227 million, or 9.2%, in 2006 compared to 2005. General and Administrative The major components of general and administrative expenses are as follows: For the years ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions, except percents) Personnel $ 1,156 $ 966 $ 890 $ 190 $ 76 19.7 % 8.5 % Professional fees 220 180 135 40 45 22.2 % 33.3 % Travel and entertainment 106 97 84 9 13 9.3 % 15.5 % Telecommunications 71 70 71 1 (1 ) 1.4 % (1.4 )% Data processing 63 59 62 4 (3 ) 6.8 % (4.8 )% Other 142 133 110 9 23 6.8 % 20.9 % General and administrative expenses $ 1,758 $ 1,505 $ 1,352 $ 253 $ 153 16.8 % 11.3 % Personnel consists of employee compensation, benefits, training, recruiting and severance costs, as well as contractor and temporary personnel costs. Personnel increased in 2007 and 2006 for additional staff to support customer facing, technology and product areas. In addition, we increased personnel performance incentive accruals, as a result of better performance against company objectives. Partially offsetting the increase in 2006 were the following activities in 2005: Changing our methodology of recognizing the cost of executive incentive cash award plans, which resulted in a catch up adjustment of $19 million. Updating the assumptions for our actuarial determined severance plan accrual which resulted in higher severance costs of $20 million. Professional fees consist of expenses for consulting, legal, accounting and tax services. Professional fees increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to consulting services used to execute our strategy and legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation. Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly have increased with the corresponding increase in our business activity. In 2006, there also was increased travel for 2006 World Cup soccer related activities. Telecommunications expense consists of costs to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with system changes, maintenance and usage. Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. Advertising and Marketing Our approach to advertising and marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated program designed to increase MasterCard brand awareness/preference and usage of MasterCard cards. Advertising and market development expenses increased 53 Table of Contents $28 million, or 2.7%, in 2007 and increased $44 million, or 4.3%, in 2006. The growth in 2007 primarily related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation of the euro to the U.S. dollar. In addition, in 2007 and 2006 the timing of certain advertising and market development expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions. We intend to continue to sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. In 2007, our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships. In 2006, however we allocated a significant amount of resources to support the sponsorship of the 2006 World Cup soccer events. During 2007, we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. Costs associated with offering cardholder benefits, such as insurance and travel assistance, for certain programs are included within advertising and marketing. In 2007, these costs increased due to new program benefits and an increase in account growth. Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets. Our marketing initiatives continue to support our customer focused strategy. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale. We will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Litigation Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors. We are also a party to a number of other litigations. Based upon litigation developments and or settlement negotiations in these other litigations and pursuant to Statement of Financial Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we recorded reserves for certain of these other litigations in 2006 and 2007. See Notes 18 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements changed as follows (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2005 $ 605 Reserve for litigation settlements 25 Interest accretion on U.S. merchant lawsuit 43 Payments (196 ) Balance as of December 31, 2006 477 Reserve for litigation settlements 3 Interest accretion on U.S. merchant lawsuit 38 Payments (114 ) Balance as of December 31, 2007 $ 404 Contribution Expense Foundation In May 2006, in conjunction with our initial public offering (IPO), we issued 13,496,933 shares of our Class A common stock as a donation to the Foundation, which is incorporated in Canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers. The Foundation builds on MasterCards existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education, understand and utilize technology, and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force. In addition, the Foundation supports organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities to enhance local economies and develop 54 Table of Contents entrepreneurs. In connection with the donation of the Class A common stock, we recorded an expense of $395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated. In both 2007 and 2006, we recorded expenses of $20 million for cash donations we made to the Foundation, completing our intention at the time of the IPO to donate approximately $40 million in cash to the Foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations. We may make additional cash contributions to the Foundation in the future. The cash and stock donations to the Foundation are generally not deductible by MasterCard for tax purposes. As a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations, there was a significant increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $2 million and $10 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These decreases were primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements, data center equipment and capitalized software. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. Investment income increased $405 million in 2007 and $64 million in 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to gains realized on the sale of a significant portion of our investment in Redecard S.A. in Brazil, partially offset by a $9 million impairment of a short term bond fund and $7 million of realized losses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, for more information about Redecard S.A. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily driven by interest income from higher cash and short term investment balances principally relating to the proceeds received from our IPO, increases in interest rates and dividends received. Interest expense decreased $4 million in 2007 and $9 million in 2006. The decrease in both years relates to lower interest accretion relating to the U.S. merchant lawsuit. In addition, in 2006, interest expense decreased due to a refund of interest assessed in an audit of the Companys federal income tax return, as well as reduced interest reserve requirements for our tax reserves. Other income, net increased $89 million in 2007 and decreased $23 million in 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to a settlement agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. The organization which operates the World Cup soccer events agreed to pay us $90 million to resolve all disputes. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily related to a $18 million settlement the Company received in resolution of a dispute of a customer agreement and $9 million in gains relating to the sale of two affiliated investments which were realized in 2005. 55 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 35.0%, 82.9% and 34.5%, respectively. The changes in the effective income tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2006 compared to 2005 primarily related to a non deductible charitable contribution of shares of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation in 2006. The components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% are as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent Income before income tax expense $ 1,671 $ 294 $ 407 Federal statutory tax $ 585 35.0 % $ 103 35.0 % $ 143 35.0 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit 28 1.6 6 1.8 4 0.9 Non deductible charitable stock contribution 138 47.0 Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit (12 ) (0.7 ) (6 ) (1.9 ) 5 1.1 Non deductible expenses and other differences (3 ) (0.2 ) 13 4.4 (3 ) (0.5 ) Tax exempt income (12 ) (0.7 ) (10 ) (3.4 ) (8 ) (2.0 ) Income tax expense $ 586 35.0 % $ 244 82.9 % $ 141 34.5 % Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the impact of the $395 charitable contribution of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation. MasterCard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of the Class A common stock we donated to the Foundation. Under the terms of the contribution to the Foundation, this contribution is generally not deductible by MasterCard for tax purposes. Accordingly, as a result of the significant difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donation, the calculation of an effective tax rate for the 2006 period is not meaningful. The significant impact on our effective tax rate was as follows: GAAPActual GAAPEffectiveTax Rate StockDonation Non GAAPAdjusted Non GAAPEffectiveTax Rate (In millions, except percents) Twelve months ended December 31, 2006: Income before income taxes $ 294 82.9 % $ 395 $ 689 35.4 % Income tax expense1 244 244 Net Income $ 50 $ 445 1 Income tax expense has been calculated with and without the impact of the stock contribution to the Foundation. 56 Table of Contents Liquidity We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities with which to manage operations. In addition, we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs for the next twelve months. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in Item 1A of this Report. See also Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Percent Increase (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (In millions, except percents) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 770 $ 650 $ 273 18.4 % 138.3 % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 315 (676 ) (34 ) 146.6 % (1,909.3 )% Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (658 ) 638 (203.1 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 4,592 $ 3,577 $ 2,228 28.4 % 60.6 % Current liabilities 2,363 1,812 1,557 30.5 % 16.4 % Long term liabilities 865 902 970 (4.1 )% (7.0 )% Stockholders equity 3,027 2,364 1,169 28.0 % 102.2 % Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $770 million compared to $650 million in 2006 and $273 million in 2005. In 2007, the increase in cash from operations was due to higher net income less the realized pre tax gain on RedeCard S.A. which is classified as an investing activity. Offsetting the increase in cash from operations was higher income tax payments, including approximately $137 million for taxes relating to the realized gain on RedeCard S.A. In 2006, the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to stronger operating performance, higher accounts payable and customer and merchant incentive accruals, partially offset by higher payments for litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 primarily relates to net sales of available for sale securities, including the sale of a significant portion of our Redecard S.A. shares. We sold all of our remaining investment Redecard S.A. in the first quarter of 2008. Cash provided by investing activities in 2007 was partially offset by cash used for investments in leasehold and building improvements to support increased workforce, data center equipment and capitalized software to expand our core functionality, including development of a new processing platform. In conjunction with this development project, we capitalized approximately $32 million of costs during 2007. Net cash used for investing activities in 2006 was primarily due to net purchases of available for sale securities as a result of the additional funds from the IPO proceeds and our investment in capitalized software to support our growing business and strategic initiatives. In 2005, cash used in investing activities was not significant. Cash used for financing activities in 2007 primarily relates to the repurchase of approximately $601 million of shares of our Class A common stock through a repurchase plan and payment of $74 million in dividends to our shareholders. The net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2006 as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of Class A common stock to investors in the IPO (including the proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) of approximately $2.5 billion, which was offset by $1.8 billion for the redemption of Class B common stock and a $12 million dividend payment. 57 Table of Contents Under the terms of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement, we are required to pay $100 million annually each December through the year 2012. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we made payments of $14 million, $96 million and $15 million, respectively, for certain other litigation settlements. On December 6, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on February 11, 2008 to holders of record on January 11, 2008 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount payable for this dividend was $20 million as of December 31, 2007. On February 5, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on May 9, 2008 to holders of record on April 9, 2008 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount needed for this dividend is estimated to be $20 million. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and anticipated cash needs. On April 27, 2007, we extended our committed 3 year unsecured $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with certain financial institutions for one year. The new expiration date of the Credit Facility is April 27, 2010. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers and, subject to a limit of $500 million, for general corporate purposes. The facility fee and borrowing cost are contingent upon our credit rating. At our current rating, we pay a facility fee of 8 basis points on the total commitment, or $2 million annually. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin of 37 basis points (the LIBOR margin) or an alternative base rate. A utilization fee of 10 basis points would be charged if outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of commitments. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2007. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2007 or 2006. The majority of the Credit Facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard International. MasterCard Europe has an additional uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros. The interest rate under this facility is Euro LIBOR plus 50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100 million euros and Euro LIBOR plus 250 basis points for amounts over the 100 million euro limit. For drawings in currencies other than the euro, interest will be charged at the above margins over the relevant currency base rate. There were no material borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2007 or 2006. HSBC Bank plc is the lender of this facility and is a customer and member of MasterCard International. Our Standard & Poors counterparty credit rating is BBB+ and our subordinated debt rating is BBB, with a stable outlook. Our access to capital and liquidity has been sufficient with these ratings. 58 Table of Contents Future Obligations The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2007 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 andthereafter (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 56 $ 9 $ 6 $ 4 $ 37 Operating leases2 116 42 40 13 21 Sponsorship, licensing & other agreements3 4 616 362 188 58 8 Litigation settlements5 507 107 200 200 Debt6 232 83 149 Total $ 1,527 $ 603 $ 583 $ 275 $ 66 1 Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co processing facility. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $497 million as of December 31, 2007 related to customer and merchant agreements. 4 We have included our current liability of $11 million relating to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non current FIN 48 liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority. 5 Represents amounts due in accordance with the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements. 6 Debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and the principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes due September 2009. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2007 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. Related Parties A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2007, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.2 billion, or 30.7% of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may result in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Item 1A of this Report. In 59 Table of Contents addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Item 1A of this Report. Seasonality During the fourth quarter, a combination of factors may cause our quarter profitability to decline. While gross revenues can be positively impacted by increases in purchase volume relating to the holiday shopping period, rebates and incentives may also increase. Operating expenses may also be higher than other quarters due to additional advertising and promotions relating to the holiday period plus increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the Companys objectives. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Revenue Recognition Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Total net assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for 26%, 26% and 15% of those net assessment revenues, representing 7%, 7% and 5% of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. 60 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 18 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement We have entered into a settlement agreement in connection with the U.S. merchant lawsuit. This settlement was discounted over the ten year payment term of the settlement. We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement in 2003 to be 8%. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A one percent increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2007, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a one percent decrease in the discount rate. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (except Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. The test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on managements judgment using internal and external data. We utilize independent valuation experts, if needed. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $457 million, including $214 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2007. We determined customer relationships, an intangible asset, have an indefinite life. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein, and no significant impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007. 61 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings, in the period. In certain situations, the Company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits. We do not record US income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations. We considered business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. If our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, additional US income tax expense would have to be recorded which would increase our effective tax rate in that period. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. If actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2007 was $104 million. On a quarterly basis, we perform impairment analyses on various technologies. During the year ended December 31, 2007, no significant impairment charges were recorded. 62 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Pensions and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering most of its U.S. employees. This pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a fixed percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits based on each participants account balance. Additionally, the Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by U.S. tax laws. The Company also maintains a postretirement plan providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for most of its U.S. employees and retirees. The discount rates for the Companys pension and postretirement plans are subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate for each plan, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows (determined on PBO basis) with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. For the pension plan, our discount rate of 6.00% as of December 31, 2007 is 25 basis points greater than the 5.75% rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for 2006. For the postretirement plan, our discount rate of 6.25% as of December 31, 2007 is 50 basis points greater than the 5.75% rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for 2006. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our pension projected benefit obligation by $1.4 million, and increase our postretirement projected benefit obligation by $1.7 million. These decreases would have a negligible effect on our annual pension and postretirement expense. An approximately equal, but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. Certain assumptions are used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure each of the plans projected benefit obligation for pension and postretirement, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan. Net actuarial gains and or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans. We determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets. The expected rate of our pension plan assets is 8.5% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.5 million. 63 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Postemployment Benefit Plan We have a formal severance plan which sets forth the guidelines with respect to severance payments to salaried employees whose normal assignment is within the United States. Approximately 3,400 of our employees are covered by the Plan. Severance benefits are determined primarily by years of service and career level in accordance with either a standard or enhanced payment schedule, which is determined by the cause of the severance action. Certain assumptions are used in the determination of the liability for expected future severance obligations. Key assumptions include the number of severed participants, number of severed individuals by career level, benefit package and discount rate. The assumption for the number of severed participants used in the calculation was 100, 120 and 100 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The career levels for these individuals was estimated using historical experience as a base, adjusted for a number of strategic and human resource initiatives implemented during these years. We review historical trends and future expectations when determining the type of benefits to be offered to the severed participants. The discount rate for our postemployment plan is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. Our discount rate of 5.50% as of December 31, 2007 is the same as the rate used in calculating the severance obligations for 2006. A 5% increase in the number of severed participants would increase our severance obligations by $1.5 million. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a 5% decrease in the number of participants. A quarter of a percentage point decrease or increase in our discount rate would have an impact of approximately $0.4 million on our severance obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies only to fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB agreed to defer the effective date of SFAS 157 for non financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 157 is still effective for the Company on January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. If the fair value option is elected, a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on elected items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Upon initial adoption of this Statement, an entity is permitted to 64 Table of Contents elect the fair value option for available for sale and held to maturity securities previously accounted for under Statement 115. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2008. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. EITF 06 11 states that an entity should recognize a realized tax benefit associated with dividends on certain equity shares and options as an increase to additional paid in capital. The benefit should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax liabilities on share based payment awards. EITF 06 11 should be applied prospectively for share based awards declared beginning January 1, 2008. The company does not believe the adoption of EITF 06 11 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) which replaces FAS No. 141, Business Combination. SFAS 141R establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer: 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and 3) discloses the business combination. This Statement applies to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses, including transactions that occur without the transfer of any type of consideration. FAS 141R is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. Early adoption is not allowed. The Company is in process of evaluating the impact, if any; that the adoption of this Statement will have on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 and establishes accounting and reporting standards that require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interest) to be reported as a component of equity, changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions, and upon a loss of control, retained ownership interest will be remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not allowed. The Company is in process of evaluating the impact, if any; that the adoption of this Statement will have on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the board of directors, governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is 65 Table of Contents to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $40 million and $35 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $22 million and $17 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2007 and 2006 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at $2 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007, there were no forward currency contracts purchased against the euro. At December 31, 2006, forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of $121 million). At December 31, 2007 and 2006, forward currency contracts against the euro were sold (with notional amounts of $50 million and $45 million, respectively). Based on the year end 2007 and 2006 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent weakening and strengthening of the euro, respectively, is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there were no forward currency contracts purchased against the Brazilian real. At December 31, 2006, forward currency contracts against the Brazilian real were purchased (with notional amounts of $11 million). Based on the year end 2006 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the Brazilian real is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at $1 million. At December 31, 2007, MasterCards investment in Redecard S.A. was subject to foreign exchange risk. Based on the year end 2007 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the Brazilian real is estimated to create a loss valued at $9 million. Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of nineteen other transaction currencies. The remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $23 million and $25 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our held to maturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of $80 million of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in a fair value loss of $1 million and $2 million for December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no material borrowings. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 66 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. At December 31, 2007, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would be immaterial. At December 31, 2006, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value was $1 million. To the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. At December 31, 2007, MasterCards investment in Redecard S.A., which is classified as an available for sale security was subject to equity price risk. At December 31, 2007, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would be $10 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we sold all of our remaining investment in Redecard S.A. and realized pre tax gains, net of commissions, of approximately $86 million. 67 Table of Contents
