Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe) (together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Non GAAP Financial Information Non GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S K, portions of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include a comparison of certain non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. MasterCard has presented non GAAP financial measures to enhance an investors evaluation of MasterCards ongoing operating results and to aid in forecasting future periods. MasterCards management uses these non GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance based compensation. More specifically, with respect to the non GAAP financial measures presented in this discussion: Operating expenses Litigation settlements have been excluded since MasterCard monitors litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing operating performance without these settlements. See Operating Expenses for a table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding litigation settlements to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. Operating expenses The non cash charge associated with the donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation (the Foundation) have been excluded to provide a comparison of the ongoing operating expenses of the business and since MasterCard evaluates operations of the business without these expenses. Effective income tax rate The income tax impacts associated with litigation settlements and the stock donation to the MasterCard Foundation have been excluded to provide a comparison of the effective income tax rate associated with ongoing operations of the business. See Income Taxes for a table which provides a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate excluding litigation settlements and the stock donation to the MasterCard Foundation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. Gross assessments growth rate The 2007 gross assessments growth rate is presented excluding a reclassification from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues and Single European Payment Area (SEPA) pricing increases. The gross assessments growth rate excluding these items allows for a more meaningful comparison of assessment revenues between periods. 47 Table of Contents Overview MasterCard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit, debit and related payment programs of over 24,000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers. We develop and market payment solutions, process payment transactions, and provide support services to our customers and, depending upon the service, to merchants and other clients. We manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment card brands, including MasterCard&reg;, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro&reg; and Cirrus&reg;, which we license to our customers. As part of managing these brands, we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services (operations fees) and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. We recorded a net loss of $254 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus net income of $1.1 billion, or $8.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and net income of $50 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in 2006. As of December 31, 2008, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and current available for sale securities and $1.9 billion in stockholders equity as of December 31, 2008. Net revenue growth of 22.7% in 2008 was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes. The foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the Brazilian real against the dollar contributed 2.5 percentage points of the increase while pricing adjustments contributed approximately 6 percentage points to the net revenue growth. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we began to experience a slowdown in purchase volumes and transactions, primarily due to economic conditions around the world. See Business Environment Challenges for additional information. Our operating expenses increased 86.7% in 2008. Excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in Operating Expenses, operating expenses increased 2.9% in 2008, of which 1.7 percentage points was due to foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating expenses in 2008 was primarily due to litigation settlements. See Litigation Settlements and Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information related to our litigation settlements. The increase in operating expenses in 2008, excluding the impact of special items, was primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses and foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by decreases in advertising and marketing expenses. Our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 110.7% in 2008, versus 72.8% in 2007 and 93.1% in 2006. Excluding the impact of special items, our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 61.0% in 2008 versus 72.7% in 2007 and 80.5% in 2006. Other income in 2008 included realized gains of approximately $86 million for the sale of the remaining shares of an available for sale security, Redecard S.A., and $75 million related to the termination of a customer business agreement. Other income in 2007 included realized gains of approximately $391 million for the partial sale of our holdings of equity securities of Redecard S.A. that were classified as an available for sale security, and $90 million from the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events in resolution of all outstanding disputes pertaining to our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See Other Income (Expense). We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as card payment transactions, creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business. Our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our 48 Table of Contents existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry (such as premium/affluent and contactless cards, commercial payments, debit, prepaid and issuer processor and terminal driving services), enhancing our merchant relationships, expanding points of acceptance for our brands, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world. We are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs, marketing, product development, technology, processing and consulting and information services for these customers. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time. See Business Environment Challenges for discussion of environmental considerations related to our strategic objectives. 49 Table of Contents Financial Results* For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 (In millions, except per share, percentages and GDV amounts) Net operations fees $ 3,759 $ 3,003 $ 2,430 25.2 % 23.6 % Net assessments 1,233 1,064 896 15.9 % 18.8 % Total revenue 4,992 4,068 3,326 22.7 % 22.3 % General and administrative 1,914 1,758 1,505 8.8 % 16.8 % Advertising and marketing 1,018 1,080 1,052 (5.8) % 2.7 % Litigation settlements 2,483 3 25 ** (86.4) % Charitable contributions to the MasterCard Foundation 20 415 (100.0) % (95.2) % Depreciation and amortization 112 98 100 14.7 % (2.1) % Total operating expenses 5,526 2,959 3,097 86.7 % (4.4) % Operating income (loss) (535) 1,108 229 (148.2) % 382.8 % Total other income 151 563 65 (73.1) % 771.0 % Income (loss) before income tax expense (383) 1,671 294 (122.9) % 468.2 % Income tax expense (benefit) (129) 586 244 (122.1) % 140.0 % Net income (loss) $ (254) $ 1,086 $ 50 (123.4) % 2,063.6 % Net income (loss) per share (basic) $ (1.95) 4 $ 8.05 4 $ 0.37 (124.2) % 2,075.7 % Weighted average shares outstanding (basic) 130 135 135 (3.5) % (0.4) % Net income (loss) per share (diluted) $ (1.95) 4 $ 8.00 4 $ 0.37 (124.4) % 2,062.2 % Weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) 130 136 136 (4.1) % (0.1) % Effective income tax rate 33.7 % 35.0 % 82.9 %1 ** ** Gross dollar volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar converted basis (in billions) 2,533 2,272 1,919 2 11.5 % 18.4 % Processed transactions5 20,966 18,752 3 16,141 3 11.8 % 16.2 % * Note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding. ** Not meaningful, see Operating Expenses and Litigation Settlements for more information. 1 The 2006 effective tax rate includes the impact of a $395 million donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation, a charitable contribution which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Income Taxes for more information. 2 In 2007, we updated GDV to exclude commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for 2006 has been restated to be consistent with this approach. 3 In 2008, we updated our processed transactions numbers to apply reversals and include certain cash transactions. Prior period numbers have been restated to be consistent with this revised methodology. Revenue has not been impacted by these changes. 4 As more fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, these amounts will be revised in accordance with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position Emerging Issues Task Force 03 6 1 on January 1, 2009. 5 The data set forth for processed transactions represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN based online debit transactions. 50 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real. The functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the U.S. dollar. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and Brazilian real, which increased revenues and expenses. More recently, the U.S. dollar has begun to strengthen against the euro and Brazilian real and if this trend continues, revenues and expenses will decrease. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (GDV) and gross euro volume (GEV), which are used in the calculation of our assessment revenues. In most non European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our assessment revenues are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus most non European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus European local currencies. In 2008 and 2007, GDV growth on a U.S. dollar converted basis was 11.5% and 18.4%, respectively, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 10.7% and 14.4%, respectively. Business Environment Challenges We process transactions from approximately 210 countries and territories and in more than 160 currencies. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. The United States is our largest geographic market based on revenues. Revenue generated in the United States was approximately 47.2%, 49.7% and 52.3% of total revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. However, revenues generated from certain non U.S. countries have grown faster than United States revenues due to differences in market maturity, economic health, price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in those countries. While the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the United States. During 2008, unprecedented events occurred in the financial markets around the world, resulting in distress in the credit environment, equity market volatility and government intervention. In particular, the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil, however it also impacted other economies around the world. Some existing customers have gone bankrupt or have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by the government. Many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted. As a result, our operating results have begun to be impacted, or could be negatively impacted, in several ways, including but not limited to the following: Our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults. Constriction of consumer and business confidence may cause decreased spending. Declining economies can change consumer spending behaviors; for example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on international travel patterns, which may decline. Mergers of our customers may lower our pricing due to the tiered pricing structure of most customer agreements, which typically offer lower pricing as higher business volumes are achieved. 51 Table of Contents Consolidation of our customers can increase the bargaining power of our customers during new and renewal contract negotiations. Uncertainty and volatility in our customers businesses makes our estimates of revenues, rebates and incentives more difficult. As such, certain prepayments under customer business agreements may not be realizable. Our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives. Decreased spending by our customers for optional or enhanced services. Government intervention and or investments in our customers may lead to the nationalization of those banking institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. Tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. See Liquidity for additional discussion of this committed, unsecured, revolving credit facility. Our customers may default on their settlement obligations. See Note 21 (Settlement and Travelers Cheque Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our settlement exposure. In addition, our business is subject to regulation in many countries. Regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. For example, see Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of global interchange proceedings. Revenues We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the GDV of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard branded cards. Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Operations fees are transaction based and are also volume based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCards system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders banks), acquirers (the merchants banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operations fees are as follows: Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholders transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to and from the issuer or, in certain circumstances, such as when the issuers systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuers instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. First, we clear a transaction by transferring the financial 52 Table of Contents transaction details among issuers, acquirers or their designated third party processors. Then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers. We charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Switch fees are charges for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (the MDS). The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. Currency conversion and cross border are volume based revenues. Cross border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different. We process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country borders. We charge issuers and acquirers for all cross border volumes. We can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchants local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer, who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholders statement in their own home currency. We charge issuers for performing currency conversion. Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S. based. Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. These fees are based on the volume of information being transmitted through and the number of connections to our systems. Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting and research services associated with our customers payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate consulting and research fees becoming a significant percentage of our business. Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, fees for U.S. acquirers accepting transactions from cardholders with non U.S. issuers, compliance and penalty fees, holograms and publications. Cardholder services are benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Assessment fees are primarily based on a customers GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate GDV. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. From time to time, the Company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. Our gross revenues from operations fees and assessments vary and are dependent on the nature of the transactions and GDV generated from those transactions. The combination of the following transaction characteristics for operations and or assessment fees determines the pricing: Domestic or cross border Credit, online debit (PIN based), offline debit (signature based) Tiered pricing with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles 53 Table of Contents Geographic region or country Retail purchase or cash withdrawal We process most of the cross border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus branded cards and process the majority of MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. Cross border transactions generate greater revenue than domestic transactions due to higher operations fees for settlement, authorization and switch, and are also subject to cross border and currency conversion fees. In addition, higher operations fees are charged on signature transactions than online transactions. In 2008 and 2007, gross revenues grew 19.8% and 20.4%, respectively. Revenue growth was the result of increased transactions and GDV, as well as price increases and currency fluctuation. Our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance based support incentives. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. The continued consolidation of our customers and the growing influence of merchants have led to enhanced competition in the global payments industry and demand for better pricing arrangements. Our revenue growth was moderated by a $145 million, or 11.0%, and a $173 million, or 15.0%, increase in rebates and incentives to our customers and merchants in 2008 and 2007, respectively. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2008, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.5 billion, or 30%, of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may result in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Item 1A of this Report. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Item 1A of this Report. 54 Table of Contents Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,655 $ 1,382 $ 1,169 $ 273 $ 213 19.8 % 18.2 % Currency conversion and cross border 1,148 868 622 280 246 32.3 % 39.5 % Acceptance development fees 305 271 217 34 54 12.5 % 24.9 % Warning bulletin fees 75 74 70 1 4 1.4 % 5.7 % Connectivity 117 101 84 16 17 15.8 % 20.2 % Consulting and research fees 92 88 76 4 12 4.5 % 15.8 % Other operations fees 724 551 449 173 102 31.4 % 22.7 % Gross operations fees 4,116 3,335 2,687 781 648 23.4 % 24.1 % Rebates (357 ) (332 ) (257 ) (25 ) (75 ) 7.5 % 29.2 % Net operations fees $ 3,759 $ 3,003 $ 2,430 $ 756 $ 573 25.2 % 23.6 % Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems increasing 11.8% and 16.2% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, $49 million, or 3.5 percentage points of the 2008 percentage increase and $3 million, or 0.3 percentage points of the 2007 percentage increase, were due to net foreign exchange gains relating to exchange rate volatility on settlement activities. Currency conversion and cross border revenues increased primarily due to increases in cross border volumes of 16.6% and 20.9% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In June 2008, we refined our methodology to calculate cross border volume growth rates primarily by changing the definition of cross border volumes from volumes where the issuer country and acquirer country are different to volumes where the issuer country and merchant country are different. Prior period volume growth rates have been restated to be consistent with the revised methodology. In addition to the increase in cross border volumes in 2008 and 2007, price increases have contributed to our revenue growth. Price increases on acquiring cross border volumes implemented in January and October 2008 accounted for approximately 21 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2008. Also, a restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in 2006 accounted for approximately 5 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2007. Acceptance development fees increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to increased volumes and the introduction of a new fee in April 2007. The new fee accounted for approximately 2 and 8 percentage points of the percentage increases in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, 3 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2007 related to a merchant agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2006 that increased transaction volumes and accordingly, acceptance development fees. Warning bulletin fees are primarily based on customer requests for distribution of invalid account information. Connectivity revenues increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to increased data volumes. Consulting and research fees remained relatively consistent in 2008 versus 2007 and increased in 2007 versus 2006. The increases in both years are primarily due to new engagements with our customers. Our business agreements with certain customers include consulting services as an incentive. Consulting services provided to customers as a result of incentive agreements were 61.5%, 38.2% and 36.9% of consulting and research fees in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, compliance and penalty fees, holograms, user pay for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, and manuals and publications. Significant components of the increase in other operations fees were as follows: Our account enhancement program, implemented in the second quarter of 2007, coupled with increased usage resulted in revenue increases of $36 million and $24 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Pricing for retail purchases in the U.S. by non U.S. cardholders increased in January 2008. This price increase, coupled with an increase in retail purchase volumes, resulted in a revenue increase of $44 million in 2008. Cardholder services increased $21 million and $7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to an increase in affluent account growth. Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates also have been increasing due to ongoing consolidation of our customers and the impact of restructured pricing. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 8.7%, 10.0% and 9.6% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, MasterCard had reduced rebates for certain customers that did not achieve contractual performance hurdles. Accordingly, these reductions in rebates decreased rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees. Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Gross assessments $ 2,345 $ 2,056 $ 1,790 $ 289 $ 266 14.1 % 14.9 % Rebates and incentives (1,112 ) (992 ) (894 ) (120 ) (98 ) 12.1 % 11.0 % Net assessments $ 1,233 $ 1,064 $ 896 $ 169 $ 168 15.9 % 18.8 % Gross assessments grew partially due to GDV growth of approximately 10.7% and 14.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, when measured in local currency terms and 11.5% and 18.4%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. Assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period. In October 2008, we increased certain assessment fees and introduced a new assessment fee to acquirers in Europe. These price changes in October 2008 contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2008. In 2007, gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within Europe. In addition, revenue growth rates in 2007 were impacted by a reclassification of $31 million from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues, offset by $12 million in pricing increases related to our April 2006 SEPA pricing changes. The increase in 2007 gross assessments, excluding the impact of the reclassifications and the pricing increase, would have been 11.3%. Rebates and incentives are primarily based on GDV but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. The rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 47.4%, 48.2% and 49.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Rebates and incentives increased during 2008 and 2007 due to new and renewals of customer agreements and increased volumes for certain merchants. However, the increase in 2008 was partially offset by reductions of rebates and incentives for certain customers that did not achieve contractual performance hurdles. These reductions in rebates 56 Table of Contents and incentives decreased rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments. In 2008 and 2007, rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, litigation settlements, contributions to the Foundation and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2008, there was an increase in operating expenses of $2,567 million, or 86.7%, versus 2007. This increase was primarily due to the settlement of antitrust litigations with Discover Financial Services (Discover and the Discover Settlement) and American Express Company (American Express and the American Express Settlement). The following table compares and reconciles operating expenses, excluding litigation settlements and the 2006 stock contribution to the Foundation (Special Items), which is a non GAAP financial measure, to operating expenses including Special Items, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement. Management uses these types of non GAAP financial measures to evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results and believes this analysis may be helpful to an investors evaluation of ongoing operating results.

Personnel expense increased in 2008 primarily due to higher costs for new personnel, salary increases and higher contractor costs. Personnel expense increased in 2007 as additional staff were added to support customer facing, technology and product areas and due to increased personnel performance incentive accruals, as a result of better performance against company objectives. Professional fees consist primarily of legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and third party consulting services related to strategic initiatives. Professional fees decreased slightly in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to lower legal expenses. In 2007, professional fees increased versus 2006 primarily due to increased legal costs to defend outstanding litigation claims and increased consulting activity related to strategic objectives. Telecommunications expense consists of expenses to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings. In 2008, these expenses decreased as a result of cost containment initiatives. In 2007, these expenses increased as a result of increased business activity. Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. The increase in 2008 is primarily driven by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and higher rent for office facilities. Advertising and Marketing Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally. Our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global MasterCard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale. We will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. Also included within advertising and marketing are costs associated with offering cardholder benefits, such as insurance and travel assistance, for certain programs. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased $62 million, or 5.8%, and increased $28 million, or 2.7%, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to cost containment initiatives, partially offset by approximately 2 percentage points related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and 58 Table of Contents Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar. The increase in advertising and marketing in 2007 was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar. In addition, in 2008 and 2007 our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships and the timing of certain advertising and marketing expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions. In 2006, a significant amount of our advertising and marketing activities were allocated to the sponsorship of the 2006 World Cup soccer events. During 2007, we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See Note 24 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of this settlement agreement. Litigation Settlements On October 27, 2008, MasterCard and Visa Inc. (Visa) entered into the Discover Settlement with Discover relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties. The Discover Settlement ended all litigation between the parties for a total of $2.75 billion. In July 2008, MasterCard and Visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement. In accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement, MasterCards share of the Discover Settlement was $863 million, which was paid to Discover in November 2008. Additionally, in connection with the Discover Settlement, Morgan Stanley, Discovers former parent company, paid MasterCard $35 million in November 2008, pursuant to a separate agreement. The net pre tax expense of $828 million was recorded in litigation settlements, in the consolidated statement of operations, during the third quarter of 2008. On June 24, 2008, MasterCard entered into the American Express Settlement which ended all existing litigation between American Express and MasterCard. Under the terms of the American Express Settlement, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard is required to pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum amount of $1.8 billion. The charge is based on MasterCards assumption that American Express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles. The quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15% of American Express United States Global Network Services billings during the quarter, up to a maximum of $150 million per quarter. If, however, the payment for any quarter is less than $150 million, the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between $150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall. MasterCard recorded the present value of $1.8 billion, at a 5.75% discount rate, or $1.649 billion, pre tax, in the second quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2003, MasterCard entered into a settlement agreement (the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement) related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit described under the caption U.S. Merchant and Consumer Litigations in Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report and recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement agreement by the court and other factors. 59 Table of Contents We recorded liabilities for certain litigation settlements in prior periods. Total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from December 31, 2006, as follows: (In millions) Balance as of December 31, 2006 $ 477 Provision for litigation settlements (Note 20) 3 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit 38 Payments (114 ) Balance as of December 31, 2007 $ 404 Provision for Discover Settlement 863 Provision for American Express Settlement 1,649 Provision for other litigation settlements 6 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit 33 Interest accretion on American Express Settlement 44 Payments on American Express Settlement (300 ) Payments on Discover Settlement (863 ) Payment on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit (100 ) Other payments and accretion (1 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 $ 1,736 * Note that table may not sum due to rounding. Contribution Expense Foundation In May 2006, in conjunction with our initial public offering (IPO), we issued 13,496,933 shares of our Class A common stock as a donation to the Foundation that is incorporated in Canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers. The Foundation builds on MasterCards existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education, understand and utilize technology, and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force. The vision of the Foundation is to make the economy work for everybody by advancing innovative programs in areas of microfinance and youth education. In connection with the donation of the Class A common stock, we recorded an expense of $395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated. In both 2007 and 2006, we recorded expenses of $20 million for cash donations we made to the Foundation, completing our intention, announced at the time of the IPO, to donate approximately $40 million in cash to the Foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations. We may make additional cash contributions to the Foundation in the future. The cash and stock donations to the Foundation are generally not deductible by MasterCard for tax purposes. As a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations, our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 is significantly higher than our effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2008. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $14 million in 2008 and decreased $2 million in 2007. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 is primarily due to increased investments in leasehold and building improvements, data center equipment and capitalized software. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 was primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements, data center equipment and capitalized software. 60 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. Investment income decreased $348 million in 2008 and increased $405 million in 2007. The change in each period was primarily due to the timing of sales of our RedeCard S.A. investment; the Company sold 22% and 78% of its shares of common stock in RedeCard S.A, and realized gains of $86 million and $391 million, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in investment income in 2008 was also impacted by lower dividend income of $14 million, primarily due to the sale of our RedeCard S.A. investment, and lower interest income of $30 million, primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest expense increased $46 million in 2008 and decreased $4 million in 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to interest accretion associated with the American Express Settlement of $44 million and higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions partially offset by lower interest accretion on the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. The decrease in 2007 was primarily due to lower interest accretion related to the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. Other income (expense) decreased $18 million in 2008 and increased $89 million in 2007. In both years gains were recognized on settlement agreements. A $75 million gain related to the termination of a customer business agreement was recognized in 2008. A $90 million settlement gain with the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events was recognized in 2007. See Note 24 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional discussion. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 33.7%, 35.0% and 82.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the impact of the charges associated with the Discover Settlement and American Express Settlement. These charges caused a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income resulting in pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions and pretax loss in higher tax jurisdictions. The resulting tax benefit of the loss was offset by a tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the Companys state effective tax rate. As a result of the remeasurement, the Companys deferred tax assets were reduced by $20 million and an income tax expense was recorded for the same amount. The change in the effective income tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily relates to a non deductible charitable contribution of shares of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation during 2006. MasterCard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of the Class A common stock we donated to the Foundation. Under the terms of the contribution to the Foundation, this donation is generally not deductible to MasterCard for tax purposes. The components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% are as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent (In millions, except percentages) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) $ (383 ) $ 1,671 $ 294 Federal statutory tax $ (134 ) 35.0 % $ 585 35.0 % $ 103 35.0 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit 11 (2.9 ) 28 1.6 6 1.8 Non deductible charitable stock contribution 138 47.0 Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit 2 (0.5 ) (12 ) (0.7 ) (6 ) (1.9 ) Non deductible expenses and other differences 2 (0.7 ) (3 ) (0.2 ) 13 4.4 Tax exempt income (10 ) 2.8 (12 ) (0.7 ) (10 ) (3.4 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ (129 ) 33.7 % $ 586 35.0 % $ 244 82.9 % 61 Table of Contents The Companys GAAP effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the Discover Settlement and the American Express Settlement. The Companys effective tax rate for 2006 was significantly affected by the $395 million charitable contribution of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation. Due to the non recurring nature of these items, the Company believes that the calculation of the 2008 effective tax rate, excluding the impacts of the Discover Settlement and American Express Settlement, and the 2006 effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the charitable stock contribution to the Foundation, will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2008, 2007 and 2006. GAAP effective tax rate calculation 2008 2007 2006 (In millions, except percentages) Income (loss) before income taxes $ (383 ) $ 1,671 $ 294 Income tax expense (benefit)1 (129 ) 586 244 Net income (loss) $ (254 ) $ 1,086 $ 50 Effective tax rate 33.7 % 35.0 % 82.9 % Non GAAP effective tax rate calculation 2008 2007 2006 (In millions, except percentages) GAAP income (loss) before income taxes $ (383 ) $ 1,671 $ 294 Litigation settlements 2,483 3 25 Stock donation to the MasterCard Foundation 395 Non GAAP income before income taxes $ 2,100 $ 1,674 $ 714 Income tax expense (benefit)1 (129 ) 586 244 Impact of litigation settlements on income tax expense (benefit) (941 ) (1 ) (9 ) Non GAAP income tax expense 812 587 253 Non GAAP net income $ 1,288 $ 1,087 $ 461 Non GAAP effective tax rate 38.7 % 35.0 % 35.4 % 1 The 2006 stock contribution to the MasterCard Foundation was a permanently non deductible item and therefore has no impact on the calculation of non GAAP income tax expense. The 2008 litigation settlements will be deductible in future periods as payments are made and are therefore considered in the calculation of non GAAP income tax expense. 62 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations; to provide for credit and settlement risk; to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions; to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt; and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $2.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and current available for sale securities to use for our operations. Our stockholders equity was $1.9 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We believe that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs, debt and litigation settlement obligations. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party. See Item 1A, Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report and Business Environment Challenges in Item 7 of this Report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business. 2008 2007 2006 Percent Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 413 $ 770 $ 650 (46.3 )% 18.4 % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 202 315 (676 ) (36.0 )% 146.6 % Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (751 ) (658 ) 638 14.3 % (203.1 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 4,312 $ 4,592 $ 3,577 (6.1 )% 28.4 % Current liabilities 2,990 2,363 1,812 26.5 % 30.5 % Long term liabilities 1,553 865 902 79.6 % (4.1 )% Stockholders equity 1,927 3,027 2,364 (36.3 )% 28.0 % Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $413 million, compared to $770 million and $650 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in cash from operations in 2008 was primarily due to a $1.1 billion increase in litigation settlement payments as a result of the Discover Settlement and American Express Settlement, offset by higher net revenues. The increase in cash from operations in 2007 versus 2006 was primarily due to higher net income less the realized pre tax gain on RedeCard S.A. common stock, which is classified as an investing activity, partially offset by higher income tax payments, including approximately $137 million for taxes relating to the realized gain on RedeCard S.A. common stock. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2008 primarily related to net sales of available for sale securities, partially offset by payments for capitalized software to expand our core functionality, including continued development of a debit and prepaid processing platform, acquisition of a business, and leasehold and building improvements to support increased workforce and data center equipment. We intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growing business and strategic initiatives. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 primarily related to net sales of available for sale securities, including the sale of a significant portion of our shares of Redecard S.A. common stock, partially offset by cash used for investments in leasehold and building improvements to support increased workforce, data center equipment and capitalized software to expand our core functionality, including development of a new debit and prepaid processing platform. Net cash used for investing activities in 2006 was primarily due to net purchases of available for sale securities as a result of the additional funds from the IPO proceeds and our investment in capitalized software to support our growing business and strategic initiatives. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to the repurchase of approximately 2.8 million shares of our Class A common stock through a share repurchase plan, the payment of approximately $80 million in quarterly dividends to our stockholders and the repayment of $80 million related to the Companys ten year 63 Table of Contents unsecured, subordinated notes that matured in June 2008. See Note 13 (Debt) and Note 14 (Stockholders Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our debt repayment and stock repurchase plan, respectively. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $601 million of our Class A common stock through a repurchase plan and payment of $74 million in dividends to our shareholders. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 primarily related to the proceeds received from the sale of Class A common stock to investors in the IPO (including the proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) of approximately $2.5 billion, partially offset by $1.8 billion for the redemption of Class B common stock and a $12 million dividend payment. On October 27, 2008, MasterCard and Visa entered into the Discover Settlement relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties. In connection with the Discover Settlement, MasterCard was required to pay $863 million to Discover and received $35 million from Morgan Stanley, Discovers former parent company, in November 2008. Also, on June 24, 2008, MasterCard entered into the American Express Settlement. Under its terms, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard is required to pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum amount of $1.8 billion. In 2003, MasterCard entered into the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. Under the terms of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, the Company is required to pay $100 million annually each December through the year 2012. See Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on these litigation settlements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $192 million of auction rate securities (ARS) classified as long term available for sale securities. As of December 31, 2007, the Company held $348 million of ARS classified as current available for sale securities. This change in classification is due to failure of the auction mechanism and a continued lack of liquidity in the ARS market. The stated maturity of the securities ranges from 10 to 33 years, and the securities are collateralized by student loans with guarantees, ranging from approximately 95% to 98% of principal and interest, by the U.S. government, via the Department of Education. We determined that the fair value of the ARS does not approximate par value, assigned a 20% discount to the par value of the ARS portfolio and recorded a temporary impairment within other comprehensive income during 2008. We have the intent and ability to hold the ARS until recovery of fair value, which may be maturity or earlier if called or if liquidity is restored in the market. See Note 4 (Investment Securities) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information. On December 2, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on February 10, 2009 to holders of record on January 9, 2009 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount payable for this dividend was $20 million as of December 31, 2008. On February 3, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on May 8, 2009 to holders of record on April 13, 2009 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount needed for this dividend is estimated to be $20 million. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and anticipated cash needs. On August 29, 2008, MasterCard notified the equity investor and holders of secured notes related to its variable interest entity (the Trust) of its intent to repay the equity investor and the obligations issued through the Trust. The repayment of aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest on the secured notes, and repayment of the equity investor and make whole payment, is expected to occur in March 2009 for a total amount of $165 million. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the secured notes at December 31, 2008. See Note 15 (Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 64 Table of Contents On January 22, 2009, Standard & Poors reaffirmed our BBB+ long term and A 2 short term counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. Our access to capital and liquidity has been sufficient with these ratings. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. On April 28, 2008, the Company extended its committed unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of April 28, 2006 (the Credit Facility), for an additional year. The new expiration date of the Credit Facility is April 26, 2011. The available funding under the Credit Facility will remain at $2.5 billion through April 27, 2010 and then decrease to $2.0 billion during the final year of the Credit Facility agreement. Other terms and conditions in the Credit Facility remain unchanged. The Companys option to request that each lender under the Credit Facility extend its commitment was provided pursuant to the original terms of the Credit Facility agreement. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility and had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard International. On January 5, 2009, HSBC Bank plc (HSBC) notified the Company that, effective December 31, 2008, it had terminated an uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros between HSBC and MasterCard Europe sprl. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2008. In June 2007, the Companys stockholders approved amendments to the Companys certificate of incorporation designed to facilitate an accelerated, orderly conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock for subsequent sale. In February 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the conversion and sale or transfer of up to 13.1 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock. In May 2008, the Company implemented and completed a conversion program in which all of the 13.1 million authorized shares of Class B common stock were converted into an equal number of Class A common stock and subsequently sold or transferred by participating holders of Class B common stock to public investors. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the conversion and sale or transfer of up to 11.0 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock in one or more conversion programs during 2009. See Note 14 (Stockholders Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Future Obligations The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2008 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 andthereafter (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 52 $ 8 $ 5 $ 39 $ Operating leases2 106 40 30 16 19 Sponsorship, licensing and other3,4 570 337 187 45 2 Litigation settlements5 1,912 712 1,100 100 Debt6 184 165 19 Total $ 2,824 $ 1,262 $ 1,341 $ 200 $ 21 * Note that totals in above table may not sum due to rounding. 1 Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co processing facility. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. 65 Table of Contents Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $527 million as of December 31, 2008 related to customer and merchant agreements. 4 We have included our current liability of $13 million relating to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non current FIN 48 liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority. 5 Represents amounts due in accordance with the Discover Settlement, American Express Settlement, U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement and other litigation settlements. 6 Debt primarily represents principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes, which are expected to be paid in March 2009, and amounts due for the acquisition of MasterCard France. See Notes 13 (Debt) and 3 (Supplemental Cash Flows), respectively, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion on these matters. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2008 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. Seasonality Our revenues are contingent upon the underlying metrics on which the revenues are calculated. Gross revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions due to the economic crisis. In response, MasterCard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter, with particular focus on advertising, personnel and travel expenses. Historically, during the fourth quarter, our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period, with offsetting increases resulting from higher rebates and incentives to our customers. Also, operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period and increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the Companys objectives. The economic environment in 2008 caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends. 66 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Asset Impairment Analyses Investments The Company invests in certain short term and long term assets, including municipal bonds, bond funds and ARS. The Companys investment strategy for these assets is to ensure capital preservation while capturing some interest return on the invested funds. The Company performs on going evaluations of its investments to assess potential impairment. Impairment of the Companys investments in municipal bonds is assessed based on market prices of similar assets, as provided by custodians of such assets. Impairment of the Companys short term bond funds is assessed based on quoted prices for these assets, as they are actively traded on a daily basis. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges associated with our investments. The fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio was $780 million as of December 31, 2008, which included $36 million of net unrealized losses. The primary analysis tool used to assess impairment of the Companys ARS investments is a discounted cash flow model. This model considers the original economic life of the asset, the relevant cash flows expected over the life of the asset, an appropriate discount rate and other factors that may be relevant. The present value of the expected future cash flows is calculated and compared to the carrying value to determine if an impairment has occurred and, if so, what is the expected duration of the impairment. Prepaid Customer and Merchant Incentives We prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives to incent usage and acceptance of our cards. In the event of customer or merchant business failure, these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business. The evaluation of recoverability of prepaid customer and merchant incentives is done whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances occur that we are not aware of, additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred. The carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was $398 at December 31, 2008. 67 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets (excluding Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. The test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on managements judgment using internal and external data. We utilize independent valuation experts, if needed. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $527 million, including $206 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2008. We determined that the majority of our customer relationships, which are intangible assets, have indefinite lives. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We completed our annual impairment testing for all goodwill and other intangibles using the methodology described herein, and no impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. If actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2008 was $166 million. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether there are any events that indicate impairment of our various technologies. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no significant impairment charges were recorded. Revenue Recognition Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV or GEV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Total net assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for 25%, 26% and 26% of those net Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV or GEV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual 68 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions assessment revenues, representing 6%, 7% and 7% of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers performance is estimated by using historical performance, customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal Proceedings We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Discount Rates for Litigation Settlements We have discounted two litigation settlements over their respective payment terms. The U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement was discounted at 8% over the ten year payment term. We estimated the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligations under litigation settlements. The discount rate is a matter of management judgment at the time of each settlement, which considers our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. For the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, a one percent increase in the discount rate would have increased annual interest expense in 2008 by approximately $3 million, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a one percent decrease in such discount rate. 69 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions The American Express Settlement was discounted at 5.75% over the three year payment term. For the American Express Settlement, a one percent increase in the discount rate would have decreased the litigation settlement expense for 2008 by approximately $24 million. A one percent decrease in the discount rate would produce the opposite impact. For the American Express Settlement, a one percent increase in the discount rate would have increased interest expense for 2008 by approximately $7 million. A one percent decrease in the discount rate would produce the opposite impact. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings, in the period. In certain situations, the Company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits. We do not record U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations. We considered business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. If our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, additional U.S. income tax expense would have to be recorded which would increase our effective tax rate in that period. 70 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Pensions and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of its U.S. employees hired before July 1, 2007. This pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a fixed percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits based on each participants account balance. Additionally, the Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by U.S. tax laws. The Company also maintains a postretirement plan providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for most of its U.S. employees and retirees. Company management representing the functional areas of compensation, benefits, treasury and finance review and approve on an annual basis assumptions used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure each of the plans projected benefit obligations for pension and postretirement, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan. The discount rates for the Companys pension and postretirement plans are subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate for each plan, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows (determined on PBO basis) with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. For the pension plan, our discount rate of 6.00% as of December 31, 2008 is equal to the 6.00% rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for 2007. For the postretirement plan, our discount rate of 6.00% as of December 31, 2008 is 25 basis points less than the 6.25% rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for 2007. Net actuarial gains and or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans. We determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets. The expected rate of return on our pension plan assets is 8.00% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 8.50% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our pension projected benefit obligation by $0.9 million, and increase our postretirement projected benefit obligation by $2.3 million. These decreases would have a negligible effect on our annual pension and postretirement expense. An approximately equal, but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.4 million. 71 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Postemployment Benefit Plan We have a formal severance plan which sets forth the guidelines with respect to severance payments to salaried employees whose normal assignment is within the United States. Approximately 3,600 of our employees are covered by the Plan. Severance benefits are determined primarily by years of service and career level in accordance with either a standard or enhanced payment schedule, which is determined by the cause of the severance action. The Company has a severance plan committee with members from different functional responsibilities, including human resources, legal and finance, that review and approve assumptions used in the determination of the liability for expected future severance obligations. Key assumptions include the number of severed participants, number of severed individuals by career level, benefit package and discount rate. The assumption for the number of severed participants used in the calculation was 100, 100 and 120 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The career levels for these individuals was estimated using historical experience as a base, adjusted for a number of strategic and human resource initiatives implemented during these years and current employment levels. We review historical trends and future expectations when determining the assumptions. The discount rate for our postemployment plan is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high quality, long term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. Our discount rate of 5.75% as of December 31, 2008 is 25 basis points higher than the rate used in calculating the severance obligations for 2007, which was 5.5%. A 5% increase in the number of severed participants would increase our severance obligations by $1.6 million. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a 5% decrease in the number of participants. A quarter of a percentage point decrease or increase in our discount rate would have an impact of approximately $0.4 million on our severance obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141R establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer: 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and 3) discloses the business combination. SFAS 141R applies to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses, including transactions that occur without the transfer of any type of consideration. SFAS 141R is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. Early adoption is not allowed. The Company will adopt SFAS 141R on January 1, 2009 and its effect on future periods will be dependent upon the nature and significance of any acquisitions subject to this statement. 72 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends ARB No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements and establishes accounting and reporting standards that require non controlling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon a loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not allowed. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 157 2 (FSP 157 2). FSP 157 2 permits delayed adoption of SFAS 157 for certain non financial assets and liabilities, which are not recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, until fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. As permitted by FSP 157 2, the Company has elected to delay the adoption of SFAS 157 for qualifying non financial assets and liabilities, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 for its non financial assets and liabilities, that are not recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities in an effort to improve the transparency of financial reporting and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 will not impact the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position as its requirements are disclosure only in nature. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position Emerging Issues Task Force 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1). FSP EITF 03 6 1 requires entities to allocate earnings to unvested and contingently issuable share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents when calculating EPS and also present both basic EPS and diluted EPS pursuant to the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective January 1, 2009 and requires retrospective application. The Company will adopt FSP EITF 03 6 1 during 2009 and is not able to project its impact on future presentations of EPS due to the inherent complexities associated with projecting future financial performance. The Companys calculation of the expected impact of FSP EITF 03 6 1 on EPS for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 2008 2007 Earnings (Loss) per Share: Basic as originally reported $ (1.95 ) $ 8.05 Basic impact of EITF 03 6 1 0.01 (0.07 ) Basic as will be reported in 2009 $ (1.94 ) $ 7.98 Diluted as originally reported $ (1.95 ) $ 8.00 Diluted impact of EITF 03 6 1 0.01 (0.04 ) Diluted as will be reported in 2009 $ (1.94 ) $ 7.96 In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP SFAS 132R 1). FSP SFAS 132R 1 provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension plan or other postretirement plan, including disclosure of how investment allocation decisions are made, major categories of plan assets, inputs and valuation techniques used to 73 Table of Contents measure the fair value of plan assets and concentrations of credit risk. FSP SFAS 132R 1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. FSP SFAS 132R 1 will not impact the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position as its requirements are disclosure only in nature. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the Board of Directors, governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. U.S. Dollar Functional Currency (In millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to purchase foreign currency $293 $22 $40 $ Commitments to sell foreign currency 154 12 22 Euro Functional Currency (In millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to sell foreign currency $66 $ $50 $ Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies. The remaining 143 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. 74 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. The fair value and maturity distribution of the Companys available for sale investments as of December 31 was as follows: Maturity (In millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2008 NoContractualMaturity 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 485 $ $ 16 $ 68 $ 112 $ 101 $ 89 $ 98 Short term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 103 103 Auction rate securities variable interest 192 192 Other Total $ 780 $ 103 $ 16 $ 68 $ 112 $ 101 $ 89 $ 290 Maturity (In millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2007 NoContractualMaturity 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 555 $ $ 14 $ 61 $ 122 $ 134 $ 103 $ 120 Short term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 306 306 Auction rate securities variable interest 348 348 Other 99 99 Total $ 1,308 $ 405 $ 14 $ 61 $ 122 $ 134 $ 103 $ 468 * Note that amounts in the above table may not sum due to rounding At December 31, 2008, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. We had no material borrowings at December 31, 2008 or 2007. See Note 13 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had a 7.36% fixed short term secured note for $149 million with a fair value of $155 million relating to the Companys Variable Interest Entity, see Note 15 (Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Equity Price Risk The Company did not have significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, MasterCards investment in shares of Redecard S.A. common stock, which was classified as an available for sale security was subject to equity price risk. At December 31, 2007, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would have been approximately $10 million. 75 Table of Contents
