Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe) (together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Non GAAP Financial Information Non GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S K, portions of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include a comparison of certain non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. MasterCard has presented non GAAP financial measures to enhance an investors evaluation of MasterCards ongoing operating results and to aid in forecasting future periods. MasterCards management uses these non GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance based compensation. More specifically, with respect to the non GAAP financial measures presented in this discussion: Operating expenses Litigation settlements have been excluded since MasterCard monitors litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing operating performance without these settlements. See Operating Expenses for a table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding litigation settlements to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. Effective income tax rate The income tax impacts associated with litigation settlements have been excluded to provide a comparison of the effective income tax rate associated with ongoing operations of the business. See Income Taxes for a table which provides a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate excluding litigation settlements to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. 47 Table of Contents Overview MasterCard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit, debit and related payment programs of approximately 23,000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers. We develop and market payment solutions, process payment transactions, and provide support services to our customers and, depending upon the service, to merchants and other clients. We manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment card brands, including MasterCard&reg;, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro&reg; and Cirrus&reg;, which we license to our customers. As part of managing these brands, we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. We recorded net income of $1.5 billion, or $11.16 per diluted share, in 2009 versus a net loss of $254 million, or ($1.94) per diluted share, in 2008 and net income of $1.1 billion, or $7.96 per diluted share, in 2007. As of December 31, 2009, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities and $3.5 billion in equity. In addition, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2009. Our net revenues increased 2.1% in 2009, primarily due to increased transactions, pricing changes and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, partially offset by approximately 1.8 percentage points relating to the U.S. dollar average exchange rates strengthening versus the euro and Brazilian real average exchange rates. Historically, we experienced greater growth in net revenues than the revenue growth in 2009. Revenue growth in 2008 was 22.7%. Our lower revenue growth rate primarily reflects the impact of the present global economic environment, which is negatively affecting our customers and their cardholders. Our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. Changes in cardholder spending behavior, influenced in 2009 by recessionary environments and rising unemployment, have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to grow our revenues. Our revenues are primarily based on volumes and transactions. Our volumes are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction. During 2009, our processed transactions increased 6.9%; however, our volumes only increased 1.4% on a local currency converted basis and therefore the average amount per transaction declined. In 2009, volume based revenues (domestic assessments and cross border volume fees) decreased compared to 2008 and transaction based revenues (transaction processing fees) increased in 2009. During 2008, our processed transactions increased 11.7% and volumes on a local currency basis increased 10.9%. During 2009, net pricing actions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to our net revenue growth. These net pricing actions included price increases in April 2009 and October 2009 partially offset by an increase in cross border rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the European Commission. Overall, revenue growth was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity and an increase to cross border rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 24.1%, 22.7% and 24.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our operating expenses decreased 48.6% in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to lower litigation settlements. Excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in Operating Expenses, operating expenses declined 6.9% in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009, we realigned our resources and implemented contingency plans in response to the current global economic and business 48 Table of Contents environment. General and administrative expenses decreased 3.1% in 2009 due to lower expenses for professional fees and travel, partially offset by increased personnel expenses as a result of severance costs incurred related to the realignment of our resources. Advertising and marketing expenses declined 19.2% in 2009 due to reduced spending on sponsorship and promotional activities reflecting cost management initiatives and market realities. Our ratios of operating income (loss) as a percentage of net revenues, or operating margins, were 44.3% in 2009 versus (10.7%) in 2008 and 27.2% in 2007. Excluding the impact of special items, our operating margins were 44.5% in 2009, versus 39.0% in 2008 and 27.3% in 2007. Other income (expense) varies depending on activities not core to our operations. In 2009, we did not have significant activity comparable to gains realized in 2008 and 2007. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as payment card transactions, creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term. See Business Environment for a discussion of environmental considerations related to our long term strategic objectives. Business Environment We process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. Revenue generated in the United States was approximately 45.5%, 47.2% and 49.7% of total revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period, but differences in market maturity, economic health, price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the United States over time. While the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the United States. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Unprecedented events which began during 2008 continued to impact the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention. In particular, the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom have continued to be significantly impacted by this economic turmoil, and it is also impacting other economies around the world. Some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments. Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential changes in laws and regulations. Many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted. MasterCards financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis. The severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present. As a result, our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted, or the Company may be impacted, in several ways, including but not limited to the following: Declining economies, foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors; for example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on cross border travel patterns, which may continue to change. Constriction of consumer and business confidence such as in recessionary environments and those markets experiencing rising unemployment may continue to cause decreased spending by cardholders. 49 Table of Contents Our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults. Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our customers businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable. Our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. Our customers may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services. Government intervention and or investments in our customers may have potential negative effects on our business with those banking institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. Tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. Our customers may default on their settlement obligations. See Note 22 (Settlement and Travelers Cheque Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of our settlement exposure. Our business and prospects, as well as our revenue and profitability, could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our customers. See Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may result in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability in Part I, Item 1A. In addition, our business is subject to regulation in many countries. Regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. For example, see Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, for a discussion of global interchange proceedings. Our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry (such as premium/affluent, quick service/low value, commercial/small business, debit, prepaid and issuer and acquirer processor services), pursuing domestic processing opportunities throughout the world, enhancing our merchant relationships, expanding points of acceptance for our brands, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world. We are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated and dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs, marketing, product development, technology, processing and consulting and information services for these customers. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time. 50 Table of Contents Financial Results As part of a review of its presentation of certain financial information, during 2009, the Company: (1) modified its presentation of details of the Companys major revenue categories included within the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the MD&A) section of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and (2) reclassified certain cardholder related enhancement expenses. In each case, the Companys intent was to better align such information with the way in which management views the underlying drivers of the business and analyzes the Companys results of operations. The modifications to the presentation within the MD&A of the detail of the Companys revenue categories did not result in any changes to the Companys historical financial statements and had no effect on the overall calculation of net revenue presented in the financial statements. The reclassification of certain cardholder related enhancement expenses did not result in any impact to the Companys overall operating expenses. See Operating Expenses for more information. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 (In millions, except per share, percentages and GDV amounts) Revenues, net $ 5,099 $ 4,992 $ 4,068 2.1 % 22.7 % General and administrative 1,935 1,997 1,857 (3.1 )% 7.5 % Advertising and marketing 755 935 1,002 (19.2 )% (6.7 )% Litigation settlements 7 2,483 3 (99.7 )% * * % Depreciation and amortization 141 112 98 26.2 % 14.7 % Total operating expenses 2,839 5,526 2,959 (48.6 )% 86.7 % Operating income (loss) 2,260 (535 ) 1,108 522.8 % (148.2 )% Total other income (expense) (42 ) 151 563 (127.8 )% (73.1 )% Income (loss) before income taxes 2,218 (383 ) 1,671 678.8 % (122.9 )% Income tax expense (benefit) 755 (129 ) 586 684.3 % (122.1 )% Net income (loss) 1,463 (254 ) 1,086 676.0 % (123.4 )% Income attributable to non controlling interests ** ** Net Income (Loss) Attributable to MasterCard $ 1,463 $ (254 ) $ 1,086 676.0 % (123.4 )% Basic Earnings (Loss) per Share1 $ 11.19 $ (1.94 )1 $ 7.98 1 676.8 % (124.3 )% Basic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 130 130 135 (0.2 )% (3.5 )% Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share1 $ 11.16 $ (1.94 )1 $ 7.96 1 675.3 % (124.4 )% Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 130 130 135 0.1 % (3.7 )% Effective income tax rate 34.1 % 33.7 % 35.0 % ** ** Gross dollar volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar converted basis (in billions) $ 2,454 $ 2,537 $ 2,273 (3.3 )% 11.6 % Processed transactions2 22,410 20,954 18,752 6.9 % 11.7 % * Note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding. ** Not meaningful. 1 As more fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, on January 1, 2009, a new accounting standard related to the EPS effects of instruments granted in share based payment transactions became effective for the Company resulting in the retrospective adjustment of EPS for prior periods. 2 Data represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN based online debit transactions, regardless of brand. The numbers were updated in 2009 to exclude a small number of certain processed transactions initiated with cards that do not bear our brands. All prior period data has been revised to be consistent with this revised methodology. Revenue was not impacted by these changes. 51 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real. The functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the U.S. dollar. For 2009 as compared to 2008, the U.S. dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and Brazilian real, which resulted in lower revenues and expenses. For 2008 as compared to 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and Brazilian real, which increased revenues and expenses. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume and gross euro volume (GEV), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives. In most non European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our domestic assessments, cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus most non European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus European local currencies. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis is compared to GDV on a local currency basis. In 2009 and 2008, GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis declined 3.3% and increased 11.6%, respectively, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 1.4% and 10.9%, respectively. Revenues Revenue Descriptions MasterCards business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders banks) and acquirers (the merchants banks). Our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands, the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Our primary revenue billing currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro and Brazilian real. We process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country borders. We process most of the cross border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus branded cards and process the majority of MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. Our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers. A combination of the following factors determines the pricing: Domestic or cross border Signature based (credit and offline debit) or PIN based (on line debit, including automated teller machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and retail purchases) Tiered pricing, with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles Geographic region or country Retail purchase or cash withdrawal 52 Table of Contents Cross border transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees. We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. The Company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories: 1. Domestic assessments: Domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on MasterCard and Maestro branded cards where the merchant country and the cardholder country are the same. A portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. In addition, domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs. Acceptance development fees are charged primarily to U.S. issuers based on components of volume, and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. 2. Cross border volume fees: Cross border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on MasterCard and Maestro branded cards where the merchant country and the cardholder country are different. Cross border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases and cash disbursements) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. Cross border volume fees also include fees, charged to issuers, for performing currency conversion services. 3. Transaction processing fees: Transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions. These fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service. Transaction processing fees include charges for the following: Transaction Switching Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. a. Authorization refers to a process in which a transaction is approved by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuers systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by MasterCard or other on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuers instructions or applicable rules. MasterCards rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. Fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers. b. Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed. Fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers. c. Settlement refers to facilitating the exchange of funds between parties. Fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers. Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. These fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the Companys network. 53 Table of Contents 4. Other revenues: Other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors, such as contractual agreements. Examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following: Fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions. This includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. Cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, the Companys professional advisory services group. The Companys business agreements with certain customers and merchants may include consulting services as an incentive. The contra revenue associated with these incentives is included in rebates and incentives. The Company also charges for a variety of other payment related services, including compliance and penalty fees, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications. Rebates and incentives (contra revenue): Rebates and incentives are provided to certain MasterCard customers and are recorded as contra revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive, including commitments to the agreement term, hurdles for volumes, transactions or issuance of new cards and the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. Rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance, the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements. Revenue Analysis In 2009 and 2008, gross revenues grew 4.0% and 19.8%, respectively. Revenue growth in 2009 was primarily due to changes in pricing, increased transactions and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts. The revenue growth in 2008 was the result of increased transactions and GDV, as well as price increases and currency fluctuation. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 24.1%, 22.7% and 24.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our net revenues in 2009 and 2008 increased 2.1% and 22.7% versus 2008 and 2007, respectively. Pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 6 percentage points in 2009. The price increases primarily related to increases to transaction processing fees in April 2009 and cross border volume fees in October 2009. The net price change include approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to an increase in cross border rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers and approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2009, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.4 billion, or 28%, of total net revenues. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may result in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A. 54 Table of Contents The significant components of our revenues were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Domestic assessments $ 2,382 $ 2,386 $ 2,099 $ (4 ) $ 287 (0.2 )% 13.7 % Cross border volume fees 1,509 1,547 1,180 (38 ) 367 (2.5 )% 31.1 % Transaction processing fees 2,042 1,777 1,490 265 287 14.9 % 19.3 % Other revenues 784 751 622 33 129 4.4 % 20.7 % Gross revenues 6,717 6,461 5,391 256 1,070 4.0 % 19.8 % Rebates and incentives (contra revenues) (1,618 ) (1,469 ) (1,324 ) (149 ) (145 ) 10.1 % 11.0 % Net revenues $ 5,099 $ 4,992 $ 4,068 $ 107 $ 924 2.1 % 22.7 % * Note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding. Domestic assessments There was a decrease in domestic assessments of 0.2% in 2009, as compared to a 13.7% increase in 2008. These variances were due to: GDV increased 1.4% during 2009, when measured in local currency terms, and declined 3.3% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus 2008. In 2008, GDV increased 10.9% when measured in local currency terms, and 11.6% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus 2007. The impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of domestic assessments from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the decrease in 2009 and 2 percentage points to the increase in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was partially offset by pricing changes implemented in April 2009 and October 2008. These price changes favorably impacted domestic assessments in 2009 by approximately 4 percentage points, of which approximately 1 percentage point was associated with certain October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. Cross border volume fees There was a decrease in cross border volume fees of 2.5% in 2009, as compared to a 31.1% increase in 2008. These variances were due to: Cross border volumes increased 0.3% in 2009, when measured in local currency terms, and decreased 6.0%, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. In 2008, cross border volumes increased 16.6%, when measured in local currency terms, and 19.0%, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. The impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of cross border volume fees from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the decrease in 2009. In 2008, the impact contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the increase. The decrease in 2009 was partially offset by approximately 7 percentage points relating to pricing changes. During 2009, the cross border pricing actions also included an increase to cross border rebates as discussed in the rebates and incentives discussion below. In addition, approximately 1 percentage point of the 7 percentage point pricing increase was associated with certain pricing changes implemented in October 2008 and repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. The increase in 2008 included approximately 21 percentage points of pricing changes related to acquiring cross border volumes. 55 Table of Contents Transaction processing fees The increases in transaction processing fees of 14.9% and 19.3% during 2009 and 2008, respectively, were due to: Pricing changes which represented approximately 8 percentage points of the increase in 2009. Processed transactions increased 6.9% and 11.7% during 2009 and 2008, respectively. The impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of transaction processing fees from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars offset the 2009 increase by approximately 2 percentage points. In 2008, the impact contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the increase. Other revenues The increases in 2009 and 2008 of 4.4% and 20.7%, respectively, were offset by approximately 1 percentage point and contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the increase, respectively, for the impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of other revenues from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars. Additionally: In 2009 compared to 2008, there were increased fees for compliance and penalty fees, implementation fees, cardholder services fees and fraud products and services partially offset by a decline in consulting and research fees. In 2008 compared to 2007, there were increased fees for account and transaction enhancement services and cardholder service fees. Rebates and incentives Rebates and incentives increased 10.1% in 2009 and 11.0% in 2008. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 24.1%, 22.7% and 24.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The amount of rebates and incentives increased due to the following: Greater rebates and incentives for certain new and renewed agreements, some of which included shorter performance periods for specific customers. We intend to continue to enter into and maintain business agreements with certain customers and merchants that provide rebates and incentives. In 2009, cross border pricing actions included an increase to a cross border rebate to encourage certain behaviors of our customers. The increase in this cross border rebate contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the increase in rebates and incentives. The impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of rebates and incentives from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars offset the increase by approximately 1 percentage point and contributed 1 percentage point to the increase in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These increases were partially offset by: Reduced estimates for rebates and incentives for certain customers which did not achieve contractual performance hurdles. In 2009, lower cross border rebates due to a decline in cross border volume growth and less marketing activity with merchants. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, litigation settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses. During 2009, the Company reclassified certain cardholder related enhancement expenses, which were previously classified as advertising and marketing expenses, to general and administrative expenses. These cardholder benefit programs, such as insurance and card replacements, were previously deemed promotional features of the cards and over time have become standard product offerings in certain card categories. Approximately $83 million and $79 million of these expenses have been reclassified in 2008 and 2007, respectively, to conform to the 2009 presentation. 56 Table of Contents Operating expenses decreased approximately $2.7 billion and increased $2.6 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These changes in operating expenses are primarily due to the settlements of lawsuits in 2008. In addition, in 2009, we initiated resource realignment programs, which increased personnel costs due to severance related expenses, and implemented contingency plans, which reduced certain other operating expenses. The following table compares and reconciles operating expenses, excluding litigation settlements (Special Items), which is a non GAAP financial measure to the operating expenses including litigation settlements, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement. Management believes this analysis may be helpful in evaluating ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods.

Personnel expense increased 5.8% and 11.6% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Personnel expense increased in 2009 primarily due to higher costs for severance and pension. Personnel expense includes $139 million, $33 million and $21 million for severance related charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increased severance costs in 2009 were the result of realignment of our resources and were partially offset by lower contractor costs and reduced payroll costs due to reduced staffing levels. The increased pension costs were primarily due to lower investment returns in 2008. Personnel expense increased in 2008 primarily due to higher costs for new personnel, salary increases and higher contractor costs. Professional fees consist primarily of legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and third party consulting services related to strategic initiatives. Professional fees decreased 27.2% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower legal fees associated with the settlement of two significant legal cases during 2008 and decreased usage of third party consulting services. Professional fees decreased slightly in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to lower legal fees. Telecommunications expense consists of expenses to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings. In 2009 and 2008, these expenses decreased as a result of cost containment initiatives. Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses, charges for impairment of assets and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. The decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates partially offset by charges for impairment of assets. The increase in 2008 was primarily driven by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and higher rent for office facilities. During 2007, the Company made a $20 million cash donation to The MasterCard Foundation. Advertising and Marketing Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally. Our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global MasterCard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale. We will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. 58 Table of Contents Advertising and marketing expenses decreased $179 million and $67 million, or 19.2% and 6.7%, in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decreases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to cost management initiatives and market realities. Additionally, the impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of amounts from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the decrease in 2009 and offset approximately 2 percentage points of the decrease in 2008. In 2008 and 2007, our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships and the timing of certain advertising and marketing expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions. During 2007, we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See Note 25 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of this settlement agreement. Litigation Settlements Expense for litigation settlements was $7 million, $2.5 billion and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for information on litigation settlements. In 2008, MasterCard and Visa Inc. (Visa) entered into a settlement agreement with Discover (the Discover Settlement) relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties. The Discover Settlement ended all litigation among the parties for a total of $2.8 billion. Previously, MasterCard and Visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement. In accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement, MasterCards share of the Discover Settlement was $863 million, which was paid to Discover in November 2008. Additionally, in connection with the Discover Settlement, Morgan Stanley, Discovers former parent company, paid MasterCard $35 million in November 2008, pursuant to a separate agreement. The net pre tax expense of $828 million was recorded in litigation settlements in 2008. Also in 2008, MasterCard entered into a settlement agreement with American Express which ended all existing litigation between American Express and MasterCard (the American Express Settlement). Under the terms of the American Express Settlement, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard is required to pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum amount of $1.8 billion. The charge is based on MasterCards assumption that American Express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles. The quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15% of American Express United States Global Network Services billings during the quarter, up to a maximum of $150 million per quarter. If, however, the payment for any quarter is less than $150 million, the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between $150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall. MasterCard recorded the present value of $1.8 billion, at a 5.75% discount rate, or $1.6 billion, pre tax, in 2008. In 2003, MasterCard entered into a settlement agreement (the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement) related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit described under the caption U.S. Merchant and Consumer Litigations in Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement agreement by the court and other factors. On July 1, 2009, MasterCard entered into an agreement (the Prepayment Agreement) with plaintiffs of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement whereby MasterCard agreed to make a prepayment of its remaining $400 million in payment obligations at a discounted amount of $335 million. The Company paid $335 million on September 30, 2009, in accordance with the Prepayment Agreement. 59 Table of Contents We recorded liabilities for these and certain other litigation settlements in 2009 and prior years. Total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from December 31, 2007, as follows: (In millions) Balance as of December 31, 2007 $ 404 Provision for Discover Settlement 863 Provision for American Express Settlement 1,649 Provision for other litigation settlements 6 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement 33 Interest accretion on American Express Settlement 44 Payments on American Express Settlement (300 ) Payments on Discover Settlement (863 ) Payment on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (100 ) Other payments and accretion (1 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 1,736 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement 21 Interest accretion on American Express Settlement 66 Payments on American Express Settlement (600 ) Payment on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (335 ) Gain on prepayment of U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (14 ) Other payments, accruals and accretion, net (4 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 $ 870 * Note that table may not sum due to rounding. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $29 million and $14 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increases in depreciation and amortization expense were primarily due to increased investments in data center equipment, capitalized software and leasehold and building improvements. Additionally, in 2009 the increase included depreciation on the Companys global technology and operations center, which was acquired under a capital lease arrangement. We expect that depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as we continue to invest in property, plant and equipment and capitalized software. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. The components of Other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as shown below: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Investment income, net $ 58 $ 183 $ 530 $ (125 ) $ (347 ) (68.5 )% (65.5 )% Interest expense (115 ) (104 ) (57 ) (12 ) (46 ) 11.1 % 80.9 % Other income (expense), net 15 72 90 (57 ) (18 ) (78.7 )% (20.2 )% Total other income (expense) $ (42 ) $ 151 $ 563 $ (193 ) $ (412 ) (127.8 )% (73.1 )% * Note that table may not sum due to rounding 60 Table of Contents Investment income decreased $125 million and $347 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates than in the prior years and realized gains from the sale of the Companys RedeCard S.A. investment. The Company sold 22% and 78% of its shares of common stock in RedeCard S.A., and realized gains of $86 million and $391 million, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest expense increased $12 million and $46 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increases were primarily due to interest accretion associated with the American Express Settlement partially offset by lower interest accretion on the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement in 2009 and 2008. Additionally, in 2008 there was higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions. Other income in 2009 included a gain of approximately $14 million on the prepayment of the Companys remaining obligation on the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. A $75 million gain related to the termination of a customer business agreement was recognized in 2008 and a $90 million settlement gain with the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events was recognized in 2007. See Note 25 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional discussion. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 34.1%, 33.7% and 35.0%, respectively. The primary cause of the changes in the effective rates was due to the litigation settlement charges recorded in 2008, which resulted in a pretax loss in a higher tax jurisdiction and pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions. In addition, deferred tax assets were remeasured and reduced by $15 million and $21 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to changes in our state effective tax rate. As a result of the remeasurements, our income tax expense was increased for the same amounts. The components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% are as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent (In millions, except percentages) Income (loss) before income tax expense $ 2,218 $ (383 ) $ 1,671 Federal statutory tax $ 776 35.0 % $ (134 ) 35.0 % $ 585 35.0 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit 25 1.1 11 (2.9 ) 28 1.6 Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit (22 ) (1.0 ) 2 (0.5 ) (12 ) (0.7 ) Non deductible expenses and other differences (18 ) (0.8 ) 2 (0.7 ) (3 ) (0.2 ) Tax exempt income (6 ) (0.3 ) (10 ) 2.8 (12 ) (0.7 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 755 34.1 % $ (129 ) 33.7 % $ 586 35.0 % * Note that table may not sum due to rounding 61 Table of Contents The Companys GAAP effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the Discover Settlement and the American Express Settlement. Due to the non recurring nature of these items, the Company believes that the calculation of the 2008 effective tax rate, excluding the impacts of the Discover Settlement and the American Express Settlement, will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2009, 2008 and 2007. GAAP effective tax rate calculation 2009 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 2,218 $ (383 ) $ 1,671 Income tax expense (benefit)1 755 (129 ) 586 Net income (loss) $ 1,463 $ (254 ) $ 1,086 Effective tax rate 34.1 % 33.7 % 35.0 % Non GAAP effective tax rate calculation 2009 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) GAAP income (loss) before income taxes $ 2,218 $ (383 ) $ 1,671 Litigation settlements 7 2,483 3 Non GAAP income before income taxes $ 2,225 $ 2,100 $ 1,674 Income tax expense (benefit)1 755 (129 ) 586 Impact of litigation settlements on income tax expense (benefit) (2 ) (941 ) (1 ) Non GAAP income tax expense 758 812 587 Non GAAP net income $ 1,467 $ 1,288 $ 1,087 Non GAAP effective tax rate 34.1 % 38.7 % 35.0 % * Note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding. 1 The 2008 litigation settlements will be deductible in future periods as payments are made and are therefore considered in the calculation of non GAAP income tax expense. During 2009, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by $17 million. The decrease in the Companys unrecognized tax benefits for 2009 is primarily due to changes in judgment related to prior year tax positions, as well as from the effective settlement of examinations with the IRS. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior periods was $146 million, all of which would reduce the Companys effective tax rate if recognized. 62 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations; to provide for credit and settlement risk; to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions; and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $2.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities to use for our operations. Our equity was $3.5 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs and litigation settlement obligations. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party. See Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in Part I, Item 1A, Note 19 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Business Environment in Part II, Item 7 for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business. 2009 2008 2007 Percent Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 (In millions, except percentages) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,378 $ 413 $ 770 233.5 % (46.3 )% Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (664 ) 202 315 (429.4 )% (36.0 )% Net cash used in financing activities (185 ) (751 ) (658 ) 75.4 % (14.3 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 5,003 $ 4,312 $ 4,592 16.0 % (6.1 )% Current liabilities 3,167 2,990 2,363 5.9 % 26.5 % Long term liabilities 791 1,553 865 (49.1 )% 79.5 % Equity 3,512 1,932 3,032 81.8 % (36.3 )% Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.4 billion, compared to $413 million and $770 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, cash from operations was primarily due to operating income, collections of accounts receivable and income taxes receivable and increases in accrued expenses for personnel and advertising costs, partially offset by approximately $946 million in litigation settlement payments. In 2008, cash from operations resulted from an increase of $2.5 billion in litigation settlement obligations, partially offset by $1.3 billion in payments for litigation settlements and increases in accounts receivable and income taxes receivable. In 2007, cash from operations was primarily due to operating income less the realized pre tax gain on the sale of shares of common stock in RedeCard S.A. which is classified as an investing activity. Net cash used by investing activities in 2009 primarily related to expenditures for our global network and net purchases of investment securities. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2008 primarily related to net sales of investment securities, partially offset by expenditures for our payment card network and an acquisition of a business. In 2007, cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the net sales of investment securities, including common shares of RedeCard S.A., partially offset by expenditures for our payment card network. We intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growing business and strategic initiatives. The auction rate securities (ARS) market was illiquid as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and therefore our ARS are classified as long term available for sale securities. We had $212 million and $240 million of ARS, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although the ARS market is illiquid, issuer 63 Table of Contents call and redemption activity occurred periodically during 2009 and 2008. See Note 5 (Investment Securities) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. Net cash used in financing activities in 2009, 2008 and 2007 included the payment of dividends and in 2009 and 2008 the repayment of $149 million and $80 million of debt, respectively. In addition, 2.8 million and 3.9 million shares of our Class A common stock acquired under share repurchase programs in 2008 and 2007 utilized approximately $650 million and $600 million, respectively. See Note 15 (Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity), Note 14 (Debt) and Note 16 (Stockholders Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information on our debt repayments of $149 million and $80 million and the stock repurchases, respectively. Dividends On December 8, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on February 10, 2010 to holders of record on January 8, 2010 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount payable for this dividend was $20 million as of December 31, 2009. On February 2, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on May 10, 2010 to holders of record on April 9, 2010 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount needed for this dividend is estimated to be $20 million. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and anticipated cash needs. Credit Availability Moodys Investors Service assigned issuer credit ratings of A3 long term and P 2 short term with a stable outlook for MasterCard Incorporated on September 9, 2009. Standard & Poors assigned counterparty credit ratings of BBB+ long term and A 2 short term with a stable outlook for MasterCard Incorporated and affirmed the counterparty credit ratings of BBB+ long term and A 2 short term with a stable outlook for MasterCard International on October 13, 2009. At MasterCards request, Standard & Poors has subsequently withdrawn ratings on MasterCard International. Our access to capital and liquidity has been sufficient with these ratings. Securities ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. On November 4, 2009, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital, if needed. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the Company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, preferred stock or Class A common stock in one or more offerings. On April 28, 2008, the Company extended its committed unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of April 28, 2006 (the Credit Facility), for an additional year. The new expiration date of the Credit Facility is April 26, 2011. The available funding under the Credit Facility will remain at $2.5 billion through April 27, 2010 and then decrease to $2.0 billion during the final year of the Credit Facility agreement. Other terms and conditions in the Credit Facility remain unchanged. The Companys option to request that each lender under the Credit Facility extend its commitment was provided pursuant to the original terms of the Credit Facility agreement. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility and had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard International. On January 5, 2009, HSBC Bank plc (HSBC) notified the Company that, effective December 31, 2008, it had terminated an uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros between HSBC and MasterCard Europe sprl. There was no borrowing under this facility at December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents Future Obligations The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2009 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents. Payments Due by Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 52 $ 7 $ 8 $ 37 $ Operating leases2 101 26 33 19 23 Sponsorship, licensing and other3,4 496 261 214 18 3 Litigation settlements5 910 606 304 Debt6 21 21 Total $ 1,580 $ 900 $ 580 $ 74 $ 26 * Note that totals in above table may not sum due to rounding. 1 Mostly related to certain property, plant and equipment. Capital lease for global technology and operations center located in OFallon, Missouri has been excluded from this table; see Note 8 (Property, Plant and Equipment) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. There is a capital lease for the Kansas City, Missouri co processing data center. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $598 million as of December 31, 2009 related to customer and merchant agreements. 4 Includes current liability of $10 million relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non current liabilities for uncertainties in income taxes, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority. 5 Represents amounts due in accordance with the American Express Settlement and other litigation settlements. The American Express Settlement requires six remaining quarterly payments of $150 million each. 6 Debt primarily represents amounts due for the acquisition of MasterCard France. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2009 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. Seasonality The changes in the global economic environment during 2009 and 2008 impacted our historical trends experienced during the fourth quarter each year, which have included increased revenues and expenses related to end of the year activities. Our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. Our lower revenue growth rates began in the fourth quarter 2008 and continued during 2009 and are primarily due to lower growth rates in purchase volumes and transactions than in the past. In addition, MasterCard implemented resource realignment and cost savings initiatives, with particular focus on personnel, travel expenditures and advertising, during 2009 and 2008. As our business and the economic environment continue to evolve, we expect new trends to emerge. 65 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Revenue Recognition Our domestic assessments require an estimate of our customers quarterly GDV or GEV to realize quarterly domestic assessments each quarter. Our domestic assessments included an estimate representing 13% of total domestic assessments in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007 and 6%, 6% and 7% of total net revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Our customers GDV and GEV is estimated by using historical performance, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. Such estimates are subsequently validated against the GDV or GEV reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, realized revenues may be materially different than initially estimated. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. Examples of the customer performance items requiring estimation include GDV or GEV, transactions, issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. In addition, certain customer agreements include prepayment of rebates and incentives. Amortization of prepayments and other assets may be on straight line basis over the life of the agreement or based on customer performance depending on the terms of the related customer agreements. Our estimates of each customers performance are based on historical customer performance, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. Such estimates are subsequently validated by information reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. If our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated. 66 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Note 19 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, the Company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits. We do not record U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations. We considered business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. If our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, U.S. income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period. 67 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Asset Impairment Analyses Prepaid Customer and Merchant Incentives We prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives. In the event of customer or merchant business failure, these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business. Impairment analysis is performed quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment analysis for each customer requires an estimation of our customers future performance and an assessment of the agreement terms to determine the future net cash flows expected from the customer agreement. Our estimates of customer performance are based on historical customer performance, discussions with our customer and our expectations for the future. If events or changes in circumstances occur that we are not aware of, additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred. The carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was $445 million at December 31, 2009. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (excluding Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill and intangible assets are assigned to our reporting units. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. Our goodwill policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We utilized a weighted income and market approach for determining the fair values of our reporting units. Our significant valuation judgments included forecasting cash flows, selection of discount rates and selection of comparable companies. We used both internal and external data to make these judgments. If market conditions or business conditions change in the future, we may be exposed to impairment charges associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $539 million, including $209 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2009. We determined that the majority of our customer relationships, which are intangible assets, have indefinite lives. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We used internal data regarding changes in our customer relationships and future cash flows to assess the indefinite life and assess fair value. If a definite life is deemed to be more appropriate, it would require amortization of the customer relationships which would result in a decline of future net income. 68 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Transfers of financial assets In June 2009, the accounting standard for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was amended. The change eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept, establishes a new unit of account definition that must be met for the transfer of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarifies and changes the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, changes the amount of gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor, and requires additional new disclosures. The Company will adopt the new standard upon its effective date of January 1, 2010 and does not expect the impact of the adoption to be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Variable interest entities In June 2009, there was a revision to the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The revision eliminates the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, requires a new qualitative approach for determining whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity, and changes the requirement of when to reassess whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity. During February 2010, the scope of the revised standard was modified to indefinitely exclude certain entities from the requirement to be assessed for consolidation. The standard is effective beginning on January 1, 2010 and the Company does not expect the impact of the adoption to be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables In September 2009, the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended. Current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable, even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors. The new accounting standard eliminates (i) the residual method of revenue allocation and (ii) the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. The Company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective January 1, 2011 via prospective adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of the standard to determine the impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Improving fair value disclosures In January 2010, fair value disclosure requirements were amended and will require incremental disclosures about instruments within the valuation categories used in the fair value measurements. The Company will adopt the guidance during 2010 and 2011, as required, and the adoption will have no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the Board of Directors, governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is 69 Table of Contents to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months.

This risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies. The remaining 136 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available for sale investments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. The fair value and maturity distribution of the Companys available for sale investments as of December 31 was as follows: Maturity (In millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2009 NoContractualMaturity 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 514 $ $ 28 $ 97 $ 96 $ 120 $ 80 $ 93 Short term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 310 310 Auction rate securities variable interest 180 180 Total $ 1,004 $ 310 $ 28 $ 97 $ 96 $ 120 $ 80 $ 273 70 Table of Contents Maturity (In millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2008 NoContractualMaturity 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 485 $ 16 $ 68 $ 112 $ 101 $ 89 $ 98 Short term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 103 103 Auction rate securities variable interest 192 192 Total $ 780 $ 103 $ 16 $ 68 $ 112 $ 101 $ 89 $ 290 * Note that amounts in the above table may not sum due to rounding At December 31, 2009, we have a credit facility which provides liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. This credit facility has variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. We had no borrowings at December 31, 2009 or 2008. See Note 14 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information. Equity Price Risk The Company did not have significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. 71 Table of Contents
