Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) and MasterCard Europe sprl (MasterCard Europe) (together, MasterCard or the Company) included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. Non GAAP Financial Information Non GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S K, portions of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include a comparison of certain non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. MasterCard presents non GAAP financial measures to enhance an investors evaluation of MasterCards ongoing operating results and to aid in forecasting future periods. MasterCards management uses these non GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance based compensation. More specifically, with respect to the non GAAP financial measures presented in this discussion: Operating expenses Selected litigation settlements from 2009 and 2008 (the Litigation Settlements) have been excluded since MasterCard monitors some litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing operating performance without these settlements. See Operating Expenses for a table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding the Litigation Settlements to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between prior periods. Effective income tax rate The income tax impacts associated with the Litigation Settlements have been excluded to provide a comparison of the effective income tax rate associated with ongoing operations of the business. See Income Taxes for a table which provides a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate excluding the Litigation Settlements to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. 47 Table of Contents Overview MasterCard is a leading global payments company that provides a critical economic link among financial institutions, businesses, merchants, cardholders and governments worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We provide a variety of services in support of the credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs of approximately 22,000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers. We primarily: offer a wide range of payment solutions, which enable our customers to develop and implement credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs for their customers (which include cardholders, businesses and government entities), manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment card brands, including MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs, process payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network, provide support services to our customers and, depending upon the service, merchants and other clients, and as part of managing our brands and our franchise, establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payment card network. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. We do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as payment card transactions, creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term. Our focus is on continuing to: grow our offerings by extending our strength in our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid and processing payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network, diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance for our brands in new geographies, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and working with new business partners such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunications companies, and build new businesses through continued strategic efforts with respect to innovative payment methods such as electronic commerce (e Commerce) and mobile capabilities. See Business Environment for a discussion of environmental considerations related to our long term strategic objectives. We recorded net income of $1.8 billion, or $14.05 per diluted share, in 2010 versus net income of $1.5 billion, or $11.16 per diluted share, in 2009 and a net loss of $0.3 billion, or ($1.94) per diluted share, in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with $3.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities and $5.2 billion in equity. In addition, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our net revenues increased 8.6% in 2010, primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, pricing changes and increased transactions. The net foreign currency impact of changes in the U.S. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and Brazilian real reduced net revenue growth by 48 Table of Contents approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. Our net revenues increased 2.1% in 2009, primarily due to increased transactions, pricing changes and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, partially offset by approximately 2 percentage points relating to the U.S. dollar average exchange rates strengthening versus the euro and Brazilian real. Historically, we experienced greater growth in net revenues than the revenue growth in 2009. The lower growth rate reflected the impact of the global economic environment in 2009, which negatively affected our customers and their cardholders. Our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. Changes in cardholder spending behavior, influenced by economic environments, have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to grow our revenues. Our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes, which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction. In 2010, our processed transactions increased 2.9% and our volumes increased 9.1% on a local currency basis. In 2009, while our processed transactions increased 6.9%, our volumes only increased 1.7% on a local currency basis, reflecting a decline in the average amount per transaction. Our growth in processed transactions in 2010 was lower than in 2009 primarily due to debit portfolio losses in the U.S. and U.K. During 2010, net pricing actions contributed approximately 5 percentage points to our net revenue growth. These net pricing actions included the effects of price increases during 2009 and 2010, which were partially offset by an increase in cross border rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the European Commission. During 2009, net pricing actions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to our net revenue growth. These net pricing actions included price increases in 2009 partially offset by an increase in cross border rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the European Commission. Overall, net revenue growth in 2010 and 2009 was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 26.7%, 24.1% and 22.7% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our operating expenses decreased 1.8% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses. The decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower personnel expenses, partially offset by increased professional fees. The net foreign currency impact of changes in the U.S. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the Brazilian real reduced expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. Operating expenses decreased 48.6% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower litigation settlements. Excluding the impact of the Litigation Settlements identified in the reconciliation table included in Operating Expenses, operating expenses declined 6.9% in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009, we realigned our resources and implemented contingency plans in response to the global economic and business environment at that time. Our ratios of operating income (loss) as a percentage of net revenues, or operating margins, were 49.7% in 2010 versus 44.3% in 2009 and (10.7%) in 2008. In 2008, excluding the impact of the Litigation Settlements, the operating margin was 39.0%. Other income (expense) varies depending on activities not core to our operations. Other income (expense) increased in 2010 from 2009, including the effects of decreased interest expense on litigation settlements and uncertain tax positions. In 2009, we did not have significant activity comparable to gains realized in 2008. As to income tax expense (benefit), effective income tax rates were 33.0%, 34.1% and 33.7% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On August 19, 2010, MasterCard entered into an agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of DataCash Group plc (DataCash), a European payment service provider. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company acquired DataCash in cash on October 22, 2010 at a purchase price of 334 million U.K. pound sterling, or $534 million. DataCash provides e Commerce merchants with the ability to process secure 49 Table of Contents payments across the world. DataCash develops and provides outsourced electronic payments solutions, fraud prevention, alternative payment options, back office reconciliation and solutions for merchants selling via multiple channels. DataCash also has a fraud solutions and technology platform. MasterCard believes the acquisition of DataCash will create a long term growth platform in the e Commerce category while enhancing existing MasterCard payment products and expanding its global presence in the internet gateway business. On December 9, 2010, MasterCard entered into an agreement to acquire the prepaid card program management operations of Travelex Holdings Ltd. (Travelex CPM) for 290 million U.K. pound sterling, or approximately $458 million, with contingent consideration (an earn out) of up to an additional 35 million U.K. pound sterling, or approximately $55 million, if certain performance targets are met. We will acquire the operations that manage and deliver consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards to business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus. The acquisition of Travelex CPM is an expansion of MasterCard into program management services. Combined with our existing processing assets and other strategic alliances, the asset will augment and support partners and issuers of prepaid cards around the world, with a focus outside of the United States. The acquisition is intended to enable us to offer end to end prepaid solutions encompassing branded switching, issuing, processing and program management services, initially focused on the travel sector. We expect to consummate the acquisition in the first half of 2011. Business Environment We process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. Revenue generated in the United States was approximately 41.6%, 42.4% and 44.1% of total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period, but differences in market maturity, economic health, price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the United States over time. While the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the United States. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention. In particular, the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil, and it has also impacted other economies around the world. More recently, European countries including Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain have experienced downgrades in sovereign credit ratings by ratings agencies, driven by fiscal challenges. Some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments. Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential further changes in laws and regulations. Many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted. MasterCards financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis and the state of economic environments. The severity of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present. As a result, our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted, or the Company may be impacted in several ways, including but not limited to the following: Declining economies, foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors; for example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on cross border travel patterns, which may continue to change. 50 Table of Contents Constriction of consumer and business confidence, such as in recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high unemployment, may continue to cause decreased spending by cardholders. Our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults. Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our customers businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable. Our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. Our customers may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services. Government intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations and or government investments in our customers, may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. Tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. Our customers may default on their settlement obligations. See Note 23 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of our settlement exposure. Our business and prospects, as well as our revenue and profitability, could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our customers. See Additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers, resulting in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability in Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) for further discussion. In addition, our business and our customers businesses are subject to regulation in many countries. Regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. See Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) for further discussion. In particular, in July 2010, the United States enacted into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. See Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations in Part I, Item 1A for further discussion, including with respect to: (1) regulation providing for limitations on debit and prepaid interchange transaction fees, (2) regulation prohibiting exclusive debit network arrangements and routing restrictions for debit and (3) the creation of independent regulatory bodies with the authority to regulate consumer financial products and, potentially, broader aspects of payment card network operations (e.g., the ability to deem MasterCard systematically important). See also Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks New regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products in Part I, Item 1A. MasterCard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. For example, in our Asia/Pacific and Latin American regions, we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the U.S. we have observed mixed economic indicators, including retail spending and unemployment rates. Notwithstanding some encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for MasterCard to grow its business. 51 Table of Contents Financial Results During 2009, the Company: (1) modified its presentation of details of the Companys major revenue categories included within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the MD&A) and (2) reclassified certain cardholder related enhancement expenses. The modifications to the presentation within this MD&A of the detail of the Companys revenue categories did not result in any changes to the Companys historical financial statements and had no effect on the overall calculation of net revenue presented in the financial statements. The reclassification of certain cardholder related enhancement expenses did not result in any impact to the Companys overall operating expenses. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 (in millions, except per share, percentages and GDV amounts) Revenues, net $ 5,539 $ 5,099 $ 4,992 8.6 % 2.1 % General and administrative 1,852 1,935 1,996 (4.3 )% (3.1 )% Advertising and marketing 782 756 935 3.5 % (19.2 )% Litigation settlements 5 7 2,483 (26.2 )% (99.7 )% Depreciation and amortization 148 141 112 4.8 % 26.2 % Total operating expenses 2,787 2,839 5,526 (1.8 )% (48.6 )% Operating income (loss) 2,752 2,260 (534 ) 21.8 % 522.8 % Total other income (expense) 5 (42 ) 151 113.2 % (127.8 )% Income (loss) before income taxes 2,757 2,218 (383 ) 24.3 % 678.8 % Income tax expense (benefit) 910 755 (129 ) 20.5 % 684.3 % Net income (loss) 1,847 1,463 (254 ) 26.3 % 676.0 % Income attributable to non controlling interests (1 ) * * * * Net Income (Loss) Attributable to MasterCard $ 1,846 $ 1,463 $ (254 ) 26.2 % 676.0 % Basic Earnings (Loss) per Share $ 14.10 $ 11.19 $ (1.94 )1 26.0 % 676.8 % Basic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 131 130 130 0.7 % (0.2 )% Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share $ 14.05 $ 11.16 $ (1.94 )1 25.9 % 675.3 % Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 131 130 130 0.8 % 0.1 % Effective income tax rate 33.0 % 34.1 % 33.7 % * * * * Gross dollar volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar converted basis (in billions)2 $ 2,727 $ 2,463 $ 2,540 10.7 % (3.0 )% Processed transactions3 23,052 22,401 20,951 2.9 % 6.9 % ** Not meaningful. 1 As more fully described in Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, on January 1, 2009, a new accounting standard was adopted related to EPS which required retrospective adjustment of EPS for the year ended December 31, 2008. 2 GDV generated by Maestro and Cirrus cards is not included. The data for GDV is provided by MasterCard customers and includes information with respect to MasterCard branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues. All data is subject to revision and amendment by MasterCards customers subsequent to the date of its release, which revisions and amendments may be material. 52 Table of Contents 3 Data represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN based online debit transactions, regardless of brand. The numbers were updated in 2009 to exclude a small number of certain processed transactions initiated with cards that do not bear our brands, and in 2010 to exclude a small number of transactions that were processed by both of MasterCards processing systems. All prior period data have been revised to be consistent with this revised methodology. Revenue was not impacted by these changes. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real. The functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the U.S. dollar. For 2010 as compared to 2009, the U.S. dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and weakened against the Brazilian real. The net foreign currency impact of these changes unfavorably impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point and favorably impacted expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. For 2009 as compared to 2008, the U.S. dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and Brazilian real, which resulted in lower revenues and expenses. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume and gross euro volume (GEV), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives. In most non European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our domestic assessments, cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus most non European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus European local currencies. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis is compared to GDV on a local currency basis. In 2010, GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis increased 10.7%, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 9.1%. In 2009, GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis declined 3.0%, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 1.7%. Revenues Revenue Descriptions MasterCards business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders banks) and acquirers (the merchants banks). Our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands, the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Our primary revenue billing currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro and Brazilian real. We process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country borders. We process most of the cross border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus branded cards and, among our largest markets, process the majority of MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Brazil. Our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers. A combination of the following factors determines the pricing: Domestic or cross border 53 Table of Contents Signature based (credit and off line debit) or PIN based (on line debit, including automated teller machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and retail purchases) Tiered pricing, with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles Geographic region or country Retail purchase or cash withdrawal Cross border transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees. We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. The Company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories: 1. Domestic assessments: Domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the cardholder country are the same. A portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. In addition, domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs. Acceptance development fees are charged primarily to U.S. issuers based on components of volume, and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. 2. Cross border volume fees: Cross border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the cardholder country are different. Cross border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases and cash disbursements) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. Cross border volume fees also include fees, charged to issuers, for performing currency conversion services. 3. Transaction processing fees: Transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions. These fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service. Transaction processing fees include charges for the following: Transaction Switching Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. a. Authorization refers to a process in which a transaction is approved by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuers systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by MasterCard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuers instructions or applicable rules. MasterCards rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. Fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers. b. Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed. Fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers. c. Settlement refers to facilitating the exchange of funds between parties. Fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers. 54 Table of Contents Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. These fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the Companys network. 4. Other revenues: Other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors, such as contractual agreements. Examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following: Fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions. This includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. Cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, the Companys professional advisory services group. The Companys business agreements with certain customers and merchants may include consulting services as an incentive. The contra revenue associated with these incentives is included in rebates and incentives. The Company also charges for a variety of other payment related services, including compliance and penalty fees, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications. 5. Rebates and incentives (contra revenue): Rebates and incentives are provided to certain MasterCard customers and are recorded as contra revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive, including commitments to the agreement term, hurdles for volumes, transactions or issuance of new cards and the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. Rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance, the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements. Revenue Analysis In 2010 and 2009, gross revenues grew 12.5% and 4.0%, respectively. Revenue growth in 2010 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, higher pricing and increased transactions. The net foreign currency impact of changes in the U.S. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the Brazilian real reduced revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. Revenue growth in 2009 was primarily due to changes in pricing, increased transactions and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 26.7%, 24.1% and 22.7% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our net revenues in 2010 and 2009 increased 8.6% and 2.1% versus 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes, which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction. In 2010, our processed transactions increased 2.9% and our volumes increased 9.1% on a local currency basis. In 2009, while our processed transactions increased 6.9%, our volumes only increased 1.7% on a local currency basis, reflecting a decline in the average amount per transaction. Our growth in processed transactions in 2010 was lower than in 2009 primarily due to debit portfolio losses in the U.S. and U.K. Pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 5 percentage points in 2010. These net pricing changes primarily related to increases in cross border volume fees in October 2009 partially offset by approximately 3 percentage points attributable to increased cross border rebates, increases in domestic assessments in April 2010, and increases in transaction processing fees in April 2009. The net pricing change also included an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. See Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. 55 Table of Contents The pricing structure for our acquirer revenues from cross border transactions was simplified in the fourth quarter of 2010. Pursuant to the previous structure, MasterCard charged a cross border volume fee but provided a rebate if MasterCard was allowed to perform the currency conversion. Beginning in October 2010, if MasterCard performs the currency conversion, the cross border volume fee charged is lower and no rebate is provided. This prospective change has no impact to net revenues. Pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 6 percentage points in 2009. The price increases primarily related to increases to transaction processing fees in April 2009 and cross border volume fees in October 2009. The net pricing change included an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to an increase in cross border rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers and an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2010, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.5 billion, or 28%, of total net revenues. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers, resulting in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A. The significant components of our net revenues were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase(Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 (in millions, except percentages) Domestic assessments $ 2,642 $ 2,382 $ 2,386 $ 260 $ (4 ) 10.9 % (0.2 )% Cross border volume fees 1,927 1,509 1,547 418 (38 ) 27.7 % (2.5 )% Transaction processing fees 2,198 2,042 1,777 156 265 7.6 % 14.9 % Other revenues 791 784 751 7 33 1.0 % 4.4 % Gross revenues 7,558 6,717 6,461 841 256 12.5 % 4.0 % Rebates and incentives (contra revenues) (2,019 ) (1,618 ) (1,469 ) (401 ) (149 ) 24.8 % 10.1 % Net revenues $ 5,539 $ 5,099 $ 4,992 $ 440 $ 107 8.6 % 2.1 % Domestic assessments There was an increase in domestic assessments of 10.9% in 2010, as compared to a 0.2% decrease in 2009, due to: GDV increased 9.1% during 2010, when measured in local currency terms, and increased 10.7% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus 2009. In 2009, GDV increased 1.7% when measured in local currency terms, and declined 3.0% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus 2008. The net impact of pricing changes increased domestic assessments growth by approximately 4 percentage points in 2010 which included the April 2010 price increase. The October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission had an approximate 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on domestic 56 Table of Contents assessments growth in 2010. In 2009, the effect of pricing changes increased domestic assessments growth by approximately 4 percentage points, of which approximately 1 percentage point was associated with the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009. See Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of domestic assessments from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars unfavorably impacted revenue growth by a minimal amount in 2010 and by approximately 2 percentage points in 2009. Cross border volume fees There was an increase in cross border volume fees of 27.7% in 2010, as compared to a 2.5% decrease in 2009, due to: Cross border volumes increased 15.2% in 2010, when measured in local currency terms, and increased 15.1%, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. In 2009, cross border volumes increased 0.2%, when measured in local currency terms, and decreased 6.2%, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. Pricing changes represented approximately a net 13 percentage points of cross border revenue growth in 2010. This increase included approximately 18 percentage points related to pricing changes implemented in October 2009, partially offset by a decrease due to the pricing structure change in October 2010. Furthemore, the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission had an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact on 2010 cross border revenue growth. The decrease in 2009 cross border volume fees was partially offset by approximately 7 percentage points relating to pricing changes. During 2009, the cross border pricing actions also included an increase to cross border rebates as discussed in the rebates and incentives discussion below. In addition, approximately 1 percentage point of the 7 percentage point pricing increase was associated with certain pricing changes implemented in October 2008 and repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. See Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of cross border volume fees from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars unfavorably impacted cross border revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in both 2010 and 2009. Transaction processing fees The increases in transaction processing fees of 7.6% and 14.9% during 2010 and 2009, respectively, were due to: Pricing changes implemented in April 2009 represented approximately 3 percentage points of the increase in 2010 and approximately 8 percentage points of the increase in 2009. Processed transactions increased 2.9% and 6.9% during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our growth in processed transactions in 2010 was lower than in 2009 due to the continuing effects of prior debit portfolio losses in the U.S. and U.K. Those debit portfolio losses impacted revenues to a lesser extent than the percentage decrease in the number of transactions due to the pricing of those products and portfolios. Growth in revenues was partially offset by the effects of transaction processing activities for which revenues are not driven by the number of transactions. Furthermore, the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of transaction processing fees from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars unfavorably impacted growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 and by approximately 2 percentage points in 2009. 57 Table of Contents Other revenues The increases in 2010 and 2009 of 1.0% and 4.4%, respectively, were due to: In 2010, there was a slight increase in consulting and cardholder services fees, partially offset by a decrease in fees from the excessive chargeback program and warning bulletins. In 2009 compared to 2008, there were increased compliance and penalty fees, implementation and cardholder services fees and fees for fraud products and services, partially offset by a decline in consulting and research fees. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of other revenues from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars unfavorably impacted growth by approximately 1 percentage point in both 2010 and 2009. Rebates and incentives Rebates and incentives increased 24.8% and 10.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 26.7%, 24.1% and 22.7% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The amount of rebates and incentives increased due to the following: The 2010 increase was primarily due to higher rebates and incentives for certain new and renewed agreements as well as increased volumes. The Company intends to continue to enter into and maintain business agreements that provide rebates and incentives to certain customers and merchants. The 2009 growth in rebates and incentives was primarily driven by certain new and renewed agreements, some of which included shorter performance periods for specific customers. This was partially offset by reduced estimates for rebates and incentives for certain customers which did not achieve contractual performance hurdles, lower cross border rebates due to a decline in cross border volume growth and less marketing activity with merchants. Cross border pricing actions in October 2009 as discussed above under Cross border volume fees, included an increase to cross border rebates to encourage certain behaviors of our customers. In 2010, the increase in cross border rebates contributed approximately 10 percentage points to the increase in rebates and incentives, partially offset by the effects of the pricing structure change in October 2010. The pricing actions in October 2009 contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the increase in rebates and incentives in 2009. There was a minimal net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of rebates and incentives from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars in 2010. In 2009, the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of rebates and incentives from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars decreased rebates and incentives by approximately 1 percentage point. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, litigation settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses. During 2009, the Company reclassified certain cardholder related enhancement expenses, which were previously classified as advertising and marketing expenses, to general and administrative expenses. These cardholder benefit programs, such as insurance and card replacements, were previously deemed promotional features of the cards and over time have become standard product offerings in certain card categories. Approximately $83 million of these expenses have been reclassified in 2008, to conform to the 2009 presentation. 58 Table of Contents The major components of our operating expenses were as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, Dollar Increase(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 (in millions, except percentages) General and administrative $ 1,852 $ 1,935 $ 1,996 $ (83 ) $ (61 ) (4.3 )% (3.1 )% Advertising and marketing 782 756 935 26 (179 ) 3.5 % (19.2 )% Litigation settlements 5 7 2,483 (2 ) (2,476 ) (26.2 )% (99.7 )% Depreciation and amortization 148 141 112 7 29 4.8 % 26.2 % Total operating expenses $ 2,787 $ 2,839 $ 5,526 $ (52 ) $ (2,687 ) (1.8 )% (48.6 )% Total operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues 50.3 % 55.7 % 110.7 % Operating expenses decreased $52 million, or 1.8%, in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses. The impact of foreign currency relating to translation from the euro and Brazilian real to U.S. dollars reduced operating expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. Operating expenses decreased approximately $2.7 billion in 2009, compared to 2008. These changes in operating expenses were primarily due to decreased litigation settlements in 2009. In addition, in 2009, MasterCard initiated resource realignment programs, which increased personnel costs due to severance related expenses, and implemented contingency plans, which reduced certain other operating expenses. The following table compares and reconciles operating expenses, excluding the Litigation Settlements, which is a non GAAP financial measure, to the operating expenses including the Litigation Settlements, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement. Management believes this analysis may be helpful in evaluating ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods.

The decline was primarily due to lower severance expense due to a realignment of resources in 2009, lower pension and other retirement related expenses, and lower share based compensation expense, partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense. Personnel expense increased 5.8% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to higher costs for severance and pension. Personnel expense included $39 million, $139 million and $33 million for severance related charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increased severance costs in 2009 were the result of realignment of our resources and were partially offset by lower contractor costs and reduced payroll costs due to reduced staffing levels. The increased pension costs were primarily due to lower investment returns in 2008. Professional fees consist primarily of legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and third party consulting services related to strategic initiatives. Professional fees increased 28.9% in 2010 versus 2009 driven by costs including the evaluation and execution of acquisition, e Commerce and other strategic opportunities. Professional fees decreased 27.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower legal fees associated with the Litigation Settlements during 2008 and decreased usage of third party consulting services. Telecommunications expense consists of expenses to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCards computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings. In 2010, these expenses increased reflecting business development efforts. Cost containment measures resulted in lower travel and entertainment expenses in 2009 versus 2008. Other expenses include rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses, charges for impairment of assets and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. The increase in 2010 includes increased expenses from foreign currency remeasurement and foreign exchange risk management related to the DataCash acquisition and the write off of an uncollectible receivable, partially offset by the 2009 asset impairment which was not repeated in 2010. The decrease in 2009 was primarily driven by favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates partially offset by charges for impairment of assets. The impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of amounts from the euro and the Brazilian real to U.S. dollars reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 and had a minimal impact in 2009. 60 Table of Contents Advertising and Marketing Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally. Our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global MasterCard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale. We will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. Advertising and marketing expenses increased $26 million, or 3.5%, in 2010 mainly due to customer specific initiatives and sponsorships. In 2009, advertising and marketing expenses decreased $179 million, or 19.2%, primarily due to cost management initiatives and market realities. Additionally, the impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of amounts from the euro and the Brazilian real to U.S. dollars reduced advertising and marketing expenses by approximately 1 percentage point and 2 percentage points in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Litigation Settlements Expense for litigation settlements was $5.0 million, $7.0 million and $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for information on litigation settlements. In 2008, MasterCard and Visa Inc. (Visa) entered into a settlement agreement with Discover (the Discover Settlement) relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties. The Discover Settlement ended all litigation among the parties for a total of $2.8 billion. Previously, MasterCard and Visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement. In accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement, MasterCards share of the Discover Settlement was $863 million, which was paid to Discover in November 2008. Additionally, in connection with the Discover Settlement, Morgan Stanley, Discovers former parent company, paid MasterCard $35 million in November 2008, pursuant to a separate agreement. The net pre tax expense of $828 million was recorded in litigation settlements in 2008. Also in 2008, MasterCard entered into a settlement agreement with American Express which ended all existing litigation between American Express and MasterCard (the American Express Settlement). Under the terms of the American Express Settlement, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard is required to pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum amount of $1.8 billion. The charge is based on MasterCards assumption that American Express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles. The quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15% of American Express United States Global Network Services billings during the quarter, up to a maximum of $150 million per quarter. If, however, the payment for any quarter is less than $150 million, the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between $150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall. MasterCard recorded the present value of $1.8 billion, at a 5.75% discount rate, or $1.6 billion, pre tax, in 2008. In 2003, MasterCard entered into a settlement agreement (the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement) related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit described under the caption U.S. Merchant and Consumer Litigations in Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and recorded a pre tax charge of $721 million consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement agreement by the court and other factors. On July 1, 2009, MasterCard entered into 61 Table of Contents an agreement (the Prepayment Agreement) with plaintiffs of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement whereby MasterCard agreed to make a prepayment of its remaining $400 million in payment obligations at a discounted amount of $335 million. The Company paid $335 million on September 30, 2009, in accordance with the Prepayment Agreement. We recorded liabilities for these and certain other litigation settlements in 2010 and prior years. Total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from December 31, 2008, as follows: (in millions) Balance as of December 31, 2008 $ 1,736 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement 21 Interest accretion on American Express Settlement 66 Payments on American Express Settlement (600 ) Payment on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (335 ) Gain on prepayment of U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (14 ) Other payments, accruals and accretion, net (4 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 870 Interest accretion on American Express Settlement 35 Payments on American Express Settlement (600 ) Other payments, accruals and accretion, net (3 ) Balance as of December 31, 2010 $ 302 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $7 million, or 4.8%, and $29 million, or 26.2%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The net increases in depreciation and amortization expense in both years reflected increased investments in data center equipment, capitalized software and leasehold and building improvements. Additionally, in 2010, the increase included the amortization of intangible assets from the DataCash acquisition. See Note 2 (Acquisition of DataCash Group plc) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. In 2009, the increase included depreciation on the Companys global technology and operations center, which was acquired under a capital lease arrangement in 2009. We expect that depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as we continue to invest in property, plant and equipment and software. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. The components of other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as shown below: For the Years EndedDecember 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 (in millions, except percentages) Investment income, net $ 57 $ 58 $ 183 $ (1 ) $ (125 ) (0.7 )% (68.5 )% Interest expense (52 ) (115 ) (104 ) (63 ) 11 (55.1 )% 11.1 % Other income (expense), net 15 72 (15 ) (57 ) (100.1 )% (78.7 )% Total other income (expense) $ 5 $ (42 ) $ 151 $ 47 $ (193 ) 113.2 % (127.8 )% Investment income decreased $1 million in 2010, reflecting lower interest rates offset by increased cash balances and realized gains on sales of investments. In 2009, investment income decreased $125 million primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates compared to 2008, and a 62 Table of Contents realized gain from the sale of the Companys RedeCard S.A. investment in 2008. The Company sold the remaining 22% of its shares of common stock in RedeCard S.A., and realized gains of $86 million in 2008. Interest expenses decreased $63 million in 2010 due to a decrease in interest on litigation settlements and on uncertain tax positions. Interest expense increased $11 million in 2009 due to interest accretion associated with the American Express Settlement partially offset by lower interest accretion on the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. Additionally, in 2008 there was higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions. Other income decreased $15 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a gain in 2009 of approximately $14 million on the prepayment of the Companys remaining obligation on the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, with no comparable events in 2010. Other income decreased in 2009 due to a $75 million gain related to the termination of a customer business agreement that was recognized in 2008. See Note 26 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional discussion. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 33.0%, 34.1%, and 33.7%, respectively. The tax rate for 2010 was lower than the tax rate for 2009 due primarily to the 2010 impact of actual and anticipated repatriations from foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by discrete adjustments in 2010 and 2009. The tax rate for 2009 was higher than the tax rate for 2008 due primarily to litigation settlement charges recorded in 2008, which resulted in a pretax loss in a higher tax rate jurisdiction and pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions. In addition, deferred tax assets were remeasured and reduced by $15 million and $21 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to changes in our state effective tax rate. As a result of the remeasurements, our income tax expense was increased for the same amounts. The components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% are as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent (in millions, except percentages) Income (loss) before income tax expense $ 2,757 $ 2,218 $ (383 ) Federal statutory tax 965 35.0 % 776 35.0 % (134 ) 35.0 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit 19 0.7 25 1.1 11 (2.9 ) Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit (24 ) (0.9 ) (22 ) (1.0 ) 2 (0.5 ) Non deductible expenses and other differences 23 0.9 (18 ) (0.7 ) 2 (0.7 ) Tax exempt income (5 ) (0.2 ) (6 ) (0.3 ) (10 ) 2.8 Foreign repatriation (68 ) (2.5 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 910 33.0 % $ 755 34.1 % $ (129 ) 33.7 % 63 Table of Contents The Companys GAAP effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the Litigation Settlements. Due to the non recurring nature of these items, the Company believes that the calculation of the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates, excluding the impacts of the Litigation Settlements, which are non GAAP financial measures, will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008, which are the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

During 2010, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by $19 million. The increase in the Companys unrecognized tax benefits for 2010 is primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior periods were $165 million, all of which would reduce the Companys effective tax rate if recognized. The Companys operations are conducted in various geographies with different tax rates. As the Companys operations evolve, this may impact the Companys future effective tax rate. As a result of the Companys expansion in its business activities in Asia Pacific (with its regional headquarters in Singapore), it received a tax incentive grant from the Singapore Ministry of Finance. The incentive is effective as of January 1, 2010, and provides for a 5% income tax rate based on annual taxable income in excess of a base amount for a 10 year period. The Company did not recognize significant tax benefits in 2010 as a result of the incentive as its expansion commenced in November 2010. The Company continues to explore additional opportunities in this region which may result in a tax rate potentially lower than 5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources We need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations; to provide for credit and settlement risk; to finance capital expenditures; to make continued investments in our business and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $3.9 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities to use for our operations. Our equity was $5.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 64 Table of Contents On August 19, 2010, MasterCard entered into an agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of DataCash Group plc, a European payment service provider. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company acquired DataCash on October 22, 2010 at a purchase price of 334 million U.K. pound sterling, or $534 million. On December 9, 2010, MasterCard entered into an agreement to acquire Travelex CPM. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company is expected to acquire Travelex CPM at a purchase price of approximately 290 million U.K. pound sterling, or approximately $458 million, with contingent consideration (an earn out) of up to an additional 35 million U.K. pound sterling, or approximately $55 million, if certain performance targets are met. The acquisition is expected to be consummated in the first half of 2011. In September 2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its Class A common stock in open market transactions. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this plan during 2010. As of February 16, 2011, the Company had completed the repurchase of approximately 0.3 million shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $75 million. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. We believe that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs and litigation settlement obligations. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party. See Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in Part I, Item 1A; Note 20 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8; and Business Environment in Part II, Item 7 for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business. Cash Flow The table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: Percent Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 (in millions, except percentages) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,697 $ 1,378 $ 413 23.1 % 233.5 % Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (641 ) (664 ) 202 (3.5 )% (429.4 )% Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 19 (185 ) (751 ) 110.9 % (75.4 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 6,454 $ 5,003 $ 4,312 29.0 % 16.0 % Current liabilities 3,143 3,167 2,990 (0.7 )% 5.9 % Long term liabilities 478 791 1,553 (39.8 )% (49.1 )% Equity 5,216 3,512 1,932 48.6 % 81.8 % Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.7 billion, compared to $1.4 billion and $413 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, cash from operations was primarily due to operating income, an increase in settlements due to customers, and an increase in accrued expenses, partially offset by litigation settlement payments, an increase in accounts receivable and income taxes receivable and the effect of stock units withheld for taxes. In 2009, cash from operations was primarily due to operating income, collections of accounts receivable and income taxes receivable and increases in accrued expenses for personnel and advertising costs, partially offset by approximately $946 million in litigation settlement payments. In 2008, cash from operations resulted from an increase of $2.5 billion in litigation settlement obligations, partially offset by $1.3 billion in payments for litigation settlements and increases in accounts receivable and income taxes receivable. 65 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities in 2010 primarily related to the DataCash acquisition and expenditures for our global network, partially offset by net cash inflows from investment security activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 primarily related to net purchases of investment securities and expenditures for our global network. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2008 primarily related to net sales of investment securities, partially offset by expenditures for our payment card network and an acquisition of a business. The auction rate securities (ARS) market was illiquid as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and therefore our ARS are classified as long term available for sale securities. We had $118 million and $212 million of ARS, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Although the ARS market is illiquid, issuer call and redemption activity at par occurred periodically during 2010 and 2009. See Note 6 (Investment Securities) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information. Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 and 2009 included the payment of dividends offset by cash provided by the tax benefit from share based compensation. The repayment of debt in 2009 and 2008 utilized cash of $149 million and $80 million, respectively. In addition, the acquisition of 2.8 million shares of our Class A common stock in 2008 under share repurchase programs utilized approximately $650 million. See Note 16 (Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity), Note 15 (Debt) and Note 17 (Stockholders Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information on our debt repayments of $149 million and $80 million and the stock repurchases, respectively. Dividends On December 7, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on February 9, 2011 to holders of record on January 10, 2011 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount payable for this dividend was $20 million as of December 31, 2010. On February 8, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on May 9, 2011 to holders of record on April 8, 2011 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount needed for this dividend is estimated to be $20 million. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and anticipated cash needs. Credit Availability On November 22, 2010, the Company entered into a committed three year unsecured $2.75 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with certain financial institutions. The Credit Facility, which expires on November 22, 2013, replaced the Companys prior credit facility which was to expire on April 26, 2011 (the Prior Credit Facility). The available funding under the Prior Credit Facility was $2.5 billion from April 28, 2006 through April 27, 2010 and then decreased to $2 billion for the remaining period of the Prior Credit Facility agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. The facility fee and borrowing cost under the Credit Facility are contingent upon our credit rating. At December 31, 2010, the applicable facility fee was 20 basis points on the average daily commitment (whether or not utilized). In addition to the facility fee, interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin of 130 basis points or an alternate base rate plus 30 basis points. The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum level of consolidated debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) financial covenant and events of default. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the 66 Table of Contents Credit Facility and had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2010. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the Prior Credit Facility and had no borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility at December 31, 2009. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. On November 4, 2009, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital, if needed. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the Company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, preferred stock or Class A common stock in one or more offerings. On January 5, 2009, HSBC Bank plc (HSBC) notified the Company that, effective December 31, 2008, it had terminated an uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros between HSBC and MasterCard Europe. There was no borrowing under this facility at December 31, 2008. Future Obligations In addition to the $458 million commitment to purchase Travelex CPM, the following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2010 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents. Payments Due by Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter (in millions) Capital leases1 $ 50 $ 7 $ 43 $ $ Operating leases2 97 26 36 19 16 Sponsorship, licensing and other3,4 534 330 182 21 1 Litigation settlements5 308 304 4 Debt6 20 20 Total $ 1,009 $ 687 $ 265 $ 40 $ 17 * Note that totals in above table may not sum due to rounding. 1 Mostly related to certain property, plant and equipment. The capital lease for our global technology and operations center located in OFallon, Missouri has been excluded from this table; see Note 9 (Property, Plant and Equipment) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. There is a capital lease for the Kansas City, Missouri co processing data center. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $666 million as of December 31, 2010 related to customer and merchant agreements. 4 Includes current liability of $4 million relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non current liabilities for uncertainties in income taxes, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority. 67 Table of Contents 5 Represents amounts due in accordance with the American Express Settlement and other litigation settlements. The American Express Settlement requires two remaining quarterly payments in the first half of 2011 of $150 million each. 6 Debt primarily represents amounts due for the acquisition of MasterCard France. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2010 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons. Seasonality Historically, our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted in the fourth quarter by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period, with corresponding higher rebates and incentives to our customers. Also, operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period. The economic crisis in 2008 caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends as gross revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions. In response, MasterCard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter, with particular focus on advertising, personnel and travel expenses. The results for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2010 were more consistent with the historical trends. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Revenue Recognition Domestic assessments require an estimate of our customers quarterly GDV or GEV to recognize quarterly domestic assessments. Domestic assessments included an estimate representing 13% of total domestic assessments in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008 and 6% of total net revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Customers GDV and GEV are estimated by using historical performance, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. Such estimates are subsequently validated against the GDV or GEV reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. If customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, realized revenues may be materially different than initially estimated. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. 68 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. Examples of the customer performance items requiring estimation include GDV or GEV, transactions, issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. In addition, certain customer agreements include prepayment of rebates and incentives. Amortization of prepayments and other assets may be on straight line basis over the life of the agreement or based on customer performance depending on the terms of the related customer agreements. Our estimates of each customers performance are based on historical customer performance, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. Such estimates are subsequently validated by information reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. If customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Note 20 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 22 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 69 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings. We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, the Company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions. We do not record U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations. We considered business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. If our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, U.S. income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period. Asset Impairment Analyses Prepaid Customer and Merchant Incentives We prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives. In the event of customer or merchant business failure, these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business. Impairment analysis is performed quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment analysis for each customer requires an estimation of our customers future performance and an assessment of the agreement terms to determine the future net cash flows expected from the customer agreement. Our estimates of customer performance are based on historical customer performance, discussions with our customer and our expectations for the future. If events or changes in circumstances occur, additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred. The carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was $497 million at December 31, 2010. 70 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets (excluding Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets are assigned to our reporting units. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. Our goodwill policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We utilized a weighted income and market approach for determining the fair values of our reporting units. Our significant valuation related judgments related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests include, as applicable, forecasting cash flows, selection of discount rates and selection of comparable companies. We used both internal and external data to make these judgments. If market conditions or business conditions change in the future, we may be exposed to impairment charges associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $971 million, including $194 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2010. We determined that the majority of our customer relationships, which are intangible assets, have indefinite lives. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We used internal data and estimates regarding changes in our customer relationships and future cash flows to assess the indefinite life and assess fair value. If a definite life is deemed to be more appropriate, it would require amortization of the customer relationships which would result in a decline in future net income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Transfers of financial assets In June 2009, the accounting standard for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was amended. The change eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept, establishes a new unit of account definition that must be met for the transfer of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarifies and changes the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, changes the amount of gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor, and requires additional new disclosures. The Company adopted the new standard upon its effective date of January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Variable interest entities In June 2009, there was a revision to the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The revision eliminates the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, requires a new qualitative approach for determining whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity, and changes the requirement of when to reassess whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity. During February 2010, the scope of the revised standard was modified to indefinitely exclude certain entities from the requirement to be assessed for consolidation. The Company adopted the new standard upon its effective date of January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 71 Table of Contents Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables In September 2009, the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended. Current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable, even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors. The new accounting standard eliminates (i) the residual method of revenue allocation and (ii) the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. The Company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective January 1, 2011 via prospective adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Fair value disclosures In January 2010, fair value disclosure requirements were amended to require detailed disclosures about transfers to and from Level 1 and 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy effective January 1, 2010 and disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis within the Level 3 (of the Valuation Hierarchy) reconciliation effective January 1, 2011. The Company adopted the new guidance for disclosures about transfers to and from Level 1 and 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy effective January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company will adopt the guidance that requires disclosure of a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis within Level 3 (of the Valuation Hierarchy) effective January 1, 2011, as required, and the adoption will have no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Disclosure about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses In July 2010, a new accounting standard was issued. This standard provides new disclosure guidance that will require companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including, but not limited to, significant purchases and sales of financing receivables, aging information and credit quality indicators. The Company adopted this accounting standard upon its effective date, periods ending on or after December 15, 2010, and the adoption had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Impairment testing for goodwill In December 2010, a new accounting standard was issued. This standard requires Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to be performed for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The provisions for this pronouncement are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, with no early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this accounting standard on January 1, 2011, and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Business combinations In December 2010, a new accounting standard was issued. This standard requires a company to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, only when comparative financial statements are presented. The disclosure provisions are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this accounting standard on January 1, 2011, and the adoption will have no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There 72 Table of Contents were no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments and the Company is determining what impact, if any, such provisions will have on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into forward contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months. The table below shows a summary of derivative contracts classified by functional currency: U.S. Dollar Functional Currency (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to purchase foreign currency $ 36 $ 1 $ 38 $ Commitments to sell foreign currency 129 (2 ) 50 (1 ) Euro Functional Currency (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to purchase foreign currency $ 2 $ $ 16 $ Commitments to sell foreign currency 14 45 U.K. Pound Sterling Functional Currency (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to purchase foreign currency $ $ $ $ Commitments to sell foreign currency 5 Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies. The remaining 134 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. 73 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities, which we generally hold as available for sale investments. Our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. The fair value and maturity distribution of the Companys available for sale investments as of December 31 was as follows: Maturity (in millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2010 NoContractualMaturity 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 315 $ $ 8 $ 33 $ 93 $ 69 $ 55 $ 57 Short term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 516 516 Auction rate securities variable interest 106 106 Total $ 937 $ 516 $ 8 $ 33 $ 93 $ 69 $ 55 $ 163 Maturity (in millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2009 NoContractualMaturity 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 514 $ $ 28 $ 97 $ 96 $ 120 $ 80 $ 93 Short term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 310 310 Auction rate securities variable interest 180 180 Total $ 1,004 $ 310 $ 28 $ 97 $ 96 $ 120 $ 80 $ 273 At December 31, 2010, we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the Companys customers. This credit facility has variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. We had no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2010 or 2009. See Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for additional information. Equity Price Risk The Company did not have significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. 74 Table of Contents
