Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard International) (together, MasterCard or the Company), included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.Non GAAP Financial InformationNon GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S K, portions of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include a comparison of certain non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. MasterCard presents non GAAP financial measures to enhance an investors evaluation of MasterCards ongoing operating results, to aid in forecasting future periods and to facilitate meaningful comparison of its results between periods. MasterCards management uses these non GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance based compensation. More specifically, the following non GAAP financial measures are presented in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:Operating expenses The provision for the Companys estimate for the financial portion of a potential settlement related to the U.S. merchant litigation, based on progress in the mediation process (the "MDL Provision"), has been excluded from operating expenses because MasterCard monitors provisions for material litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing operating performance without these amounts. See " Operating Expenses" for the table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding the MDL Provision to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Effective income tax rate The income tax impact associated with the MDL Provision has been excluded to provide a comparison of the effective income tax rate associated with ongoing operations of the business. See " Income Taxes" for a table which provides a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate excluding the MDL Provision to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. OverviewMasterCard is a global payments and technology company that connects billions of consumers, thousands of financial institutions, millions of merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We envision an environment where electronic payment is the predominant means of payment. We use our technology and expertise to make payments more convenient, secure and efficient to enable consumers to meet their needs and to provide value to all stakeholders in the payments system.We offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable our customers and partners to develop and implement credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs and solutions to deliver value to consumers. Our customers and partners include financial institutions and other entities that act as issuers and acquirers, merchants, government entities, telecommunications companies and other businesses. We manage a family of well known, widely accepted payment brands, including MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs and solutions. We process payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network and provide support services to our customers and other partners. As part of managing our brands, we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands. As cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards and other devices that carry our brands.41Table of ContentsWe analyze our ability to grow based on three drivers: we track trends in personal consumption expenditures;we focus on the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment ( such as payment card transactions); andwe seek to grow our share in electronic payments, including with innovative solutions and new technology.We support our focus on these drivers by continuing to:grow our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid, commercial and processing payment transactions over the MasterCard Worldwide Network,diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance for our brands throughout the world, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and working with new partners such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunications companies, andbuild new businesses through technology and continued strategic efforts and alliances with respect to innovative payment methods, such as electronic commerce (e Commerce) and mobile capabilities.See Business Environment for a discussion of considerations related to our long term strategic objectives. We recorded net income of $1.9 billion, or $14.85 per diluted share, in 2011 versus net income of $1.8 billion, or $14.05 per diluted share, in 2010, and net income of $1.5 billion, or $11.16 per diluted share, in 2009. In addition, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our 2011 financial results were significantly impacted by the MDL Provision of $770 million (see " Income Taxes" for a table which provides a reconciliation showing the $495 million after tax impact to the net income attributable to MasterCard). Our net revenues increased 21.2% in 2011 primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions. Recent acquisitions also contributed approximately 3 percentage points to revenue growth in 2011. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of revenues from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact on net revenues of approximately 2 percentage points in 2011. Our net revenues increased 8.6% in 2010, primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, pricing changes and increased transactions. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of revenues from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars reduced net revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. Our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. Changes in cardholder spending behavior, influenced by economic conditions, impact our ability to grow our revenues. Our revenues are primarily impacted by the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands, and the number of transactions. In 2011, volume based revenues (domestic assessments and cross border volume fees) and transaction based revenues (transaction processing fees) increased compared to 2010. In 2011, our processed transactions increased 18.3% and our volumes increased 16.1% on a local currency basis. This compares to increased processed transactions of 2.9% and increased volumes of 9.1% on a local currency basis in 2010. The net effects of pricing actions contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our net revenue growth in 2011. During 2010, net pricing actions contributed approximately 5 percentage points to our net revenue growth. These net pricing actions included the effects of price increases during 2009 and 2010, which were partially offset by an increase in related cross border rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the European Commission. Overall, net revenue growth for 2011 and 2010 was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 24.9%, 26.7% and 24.1% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Our operating expenses increased 43.6% in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the MDL Provision and greater general and administrative expenses, including higher personnel expenses to support the Companys strategic initiatives and personnel expenses related to recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the MDL Provision specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in " Operating Expenses," operating expenses increased 16.0% in 2011 compared to 2010. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of expenses from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars increased expenses by approximately 2 percentage points in 2011. Our operating expenses decreased 1.8% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses. The decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower personnel expenses, partially offset by increased professional fees. The net foreign currency impact 42Table of Contentsof changes in the U.S. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the Brazilian real reduced expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010. Our ratios of operating income as a percentage of net revenues, or operating margins, were 40.4%, 49.7% and 44.3% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding the impact of the MDL Provision in 2011, our operating margin was 51.9%. The effective income tax rates were 30.6%, 33.0% and 34.1% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On April 15, 2011, MasterCard acquired the prepaid card program management operations of Travelex Holdings Ltd., since renamed Access Prepaid Worldwide (Access), at a purchase price of 295 million U.K. pound sterling, or $481 million, including adjustments for working capital, with contingent consideration (an earn out) of up to an additional 35 million U.K. pound sterling, or approximately $57 million, if certain performance targets were met. See Note 2 (Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Through Access, MasterCard manages and delivers consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards through business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus. Access enables us to offer end to end prepaid card solutions encompassing branded switching, issuer processing and program management services, primarily focused on the travel sector and in markets outside the United States.On October 22, 2010 MasterCard acquired all the outstanding shares of DataCash Group plc (DataCash), a payment service provider with operations in Europe and Brazil, at a purchase price of 334 million U.K. pound sterling, or $534 million. DataCash provides e Commerce merchants with the ability to process secure payments across the world. DataCash develops and provides outsourced electronic payments solutions, fraud prevention, alternative payment options, back office reconciliation and solutions for merchants selling via multiple channels. DataCash also has a fraud solutions and technology platform. MasterCard believes the acquisition of DataCash will create a long term growth platform in the e Commerce category while enhancing existing MasterCard payment products and expanding its global presence in the internet gateway business.Business Environment We process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. Net revenue generated in the United States was 39.6%, 41.6% and 42.4% of total net revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period, but differences in market growth, economic health, and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the United States over time. While the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the United States.The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention. The economies of the United States and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil. More recently, countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies, including several in Europe as well as the United States. In addition, some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments. Many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential further changes in laws and regulations. Many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted.MasterCards financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies. The condition of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance. As a result, our revenue may be negatively impacted, or the Company may be impacted in several ways. For a full discussion see "Risk Factors Business Risks Unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected, and may continue to affect, many of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.In addition, our business and our customers businesses are subject to regulation in many countries. Regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. See Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this Report for further discussion. MasterCard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. For example, in our Asia 43Table of ContentsPacific and Latin American regions, we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the United States and Europe we have recently experienced significant growth in dollar volume despite mixed economic indicators. Notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for MasterCard to grow its business.Financial ResultsOur operating results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 (in millions, except per share data, percentages and GDV amounts)Revenues, net$6,714 $5,539 $5,099 21.2% 8.6%Operating Expenses: General and administrative2,196 1,857 1,942 18.3% (4.4)%Advertising and marketing841 782 756 7.6% 3.5%Provision for litigation settlement770 ** **Depreciation and amortization194 148 141 31.1% 4.8%Total operating expenses4,001 2,787 2,839 43.6% (1.8)%Operating income2,713 2,752 2,260 (1.4)% 21.8%Total other income (expense)33 5 (42) ** **Income before income taxes2,746 2,757 2,218 (0.4)% 24.3%Income tax expense842 910 755 (7.6)% 20.5%Net income1,904 1,847 1,463 3.1% 26.3%Loss (income) attributable to non controlling interests2 (1) ** **Net Income Attributable to MasterCard$1,906 $1,846 $1,463 3.3% 26.2% Basic Earnings per Share$14.90 $14.10 $11.19 5.7% 26.0%Basic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding128 131 130 (2.2)% 0.7%Diluted Earnings per Share$14.85 $14.05 $11.16 5.7% 25.9%Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding128 131 130 (2.2)% 0.8%Effective Income Tax Rate30.6% 33.0% 34.1% ** **Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar Converted Basis (in billions) 1$3,249 $2,723 $2,463 19.3% 10.7%Processed transactions 227,265 23,052 22,401 18.3% 2.9% ** Not meaningful.1 The data for GDV is provided by MasterCard customers and includes information with respect to MasterCard branded transactions that are not processed by MasterCard and for which MasterCard does not earn significant revenues. GDV may be revised by MasterCards customers after its original submission and these revisions may be material. GDV generated by Maestro and Cirrus cards is not included. 2 Represents total number of transactions processed by MasterCard and growth from the comparable periods.Impact of Foreign Currency RatesOur overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real. The functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the U.S. dollar. For 2011 as compared to 2010, the U.S. dollar weakened against both the euro and the Brazilian real. Accordingly, the net foreign currency impact of changes in the U.S. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and Brazilian real increased net revenues and expenses by approximately 2 percentage points in 2011. For 2010 as compared to 2009, the U.S. dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and weakened against the Brazilian 44Table of Contentsreal, which decreased revenues and expenses by approximately 1 percentage point.In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (GDV) and gross euro volume (GEV), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives. In most non European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our domestic assessments, cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus most non European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus European local currencies. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. In 2011, GDV on a U.S. converted basis increased 19.3%, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 16.1%. In 2010, GDV on a U.S. converted basis increased 10.7%, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 9.1%. The Company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in Note 22 (Foreign Exchange Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.RevenuesRevenue DescriptionsMasterCards business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants financial institutions). Our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands, the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Our primary revenue billing currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro and Brazilian real.We process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country borders. We process most of the cross border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus branded cards and process the majority of MasterCard branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and a select number of other smaller countries.Our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers. A combination of the following factors determines the pricing:Domestic or cross borderSignature based (credit and debit) or PIN based (debit, including automated teller machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and retail purchases)Tiered pricing, with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdlesGeographic region or countryRetail purchase or cash withdrawalProcessed or not processed by MasterCardIn general, cross border transactions generate higher revenue than domestic transactions since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be modified for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements.The Company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories:1.Domestic assessments: Domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the acquirer country and the issuer country are the same. A portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. In addition, domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs. Acceptance development fees are charged primarily to U.S. issuers based on components of volume, and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. Market development fees are charged primarily to issuers and acquirers based on components of volume, and support our focus on building brand awareness and card activation, increasing purchase volumes, cross 45Table of Contentsborder card usage, and other general marketing purposes.2.Cross border volume fees: Cross border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the acquirer country and the issuer country are different. Cross border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases and cash disbursements) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. Cross border volume fees also include fees charged to issuers for performing currency conversion services.3.Transaction processing fees: Transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions. These fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service. Transaction processing fees include charges for the following:Transaction Switching Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.a.Authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuers systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by MasterCard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuers instructions or applicable rules (also known as "stand in"). Our standards, which may vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. Fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers.b.Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction. MasterCard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems. MasterCard clearing solutions can be managed with minimal system development, which has enabled us to accelerate our customers ability to develop customized programs and services. Fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers.c.Settlement. Once transactions have been authorized and cleared, MasterCard helps to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties. Once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position. Fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers.Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. These fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the Companys network.4.Other revenues: Other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors, such as contractual agreements. Examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following:Fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions. This includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants.Cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with MasterCard branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines.Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, the Companys professional advisory services group. The Companys business agreements with certain customers and merchants may include consulting services as an incentive. The contra revenue associated with these incentives is included in rebates and incentives.Program management services provided to prepaid card issuers. This primarily includes foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees, and ATM withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards. See Note 2 (Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion.The Company also charges for a variety of other payment related services, including rules compliance, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications.46Table of Contents5.Rebates and incentives (contra revenue): Rebates and incentives are provided to certain MasterCard customers and are recorded as contra revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive, including commitments to the agreement term, hurdles for volumes, transactions or issuance of new cards, launch of new programs, or the execution of marketing programs. Rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance, the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements.Revenue AnalysisIn 2011 and 2010, gross revenues increased $1.4 billion and $841 million, or 18.2% and 12.5%, respectively. Revenue growth in 2011 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions. Revenue growth in 2010 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on our cards carrying our brands, higher pricing and increased transactions. Rebates and incentives in 2011 and 2010 increased $202 and $401 million, or 10.0% and 24.8%, versus 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our net revenues in 2011 and 2010 increased 21.2% and 8.6% versus 2010 and 2009, respectively.Our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes, which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands. In 2011, our processed transactions increased 18.3% and our volumes increased 16.1% on a local currency basis. In 2010, our processed transactions increased 2.9% and our volumes increased 9.1% on a local currency basis. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our net revenue growth in 2011. The effects of pricing actions implemented in 2011 and 2010 contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our net revenue growth for 2011. The pricing structure for our acquirer revenues from cross border transactions was simplified in the fourth quarter of 2010. Pursuant to the previous structure, MasterCard charged a cross border volume fee but provided a rebate if MasterCard was allowed to perform the currency conversion. Beginning in October 2010, if MasterCard performs the currency conversion, the cross border volume fee charged is lower and no rebate is provided. This change had no impact on net revenues. In 2010, pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 5 percentage points. These net pricing changes primarilyrelated to increases in cross border volume fees, domestic assessments, and transaction processing fees, partially offset by approximately 3 percentage points attributable to increased cross border rebates. The net pricing change also included an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission. See Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2011, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.7 billion, or 26%, of total net revenues. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See Risk Factors Business Risks Additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers, resulting in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See Risk Factors Business Risks We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.The significant components of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 (in millions, except percentages)Domestic assessments$3,246 $2,642 $2,382 22.9% 10.9%Cross border volume fees2,094 1,927 1,509 8.7% 27.7%Transaction processing fees2,595 2,198 2,042 18.1% 7.6%Other revenues1,000 791 784 26.4% 1.0%Gross revenues8,935 7,558 6,717 18.2% 12.5%Rebates and incentives (contra revenues)(2,221) (2,019) (1,618) 10.0% 24.8%Net revenues$6,714 $5,539 $5,099 21.2% 8.6%47Table of ContentsDomestic assessments There was an increase in domestic assessments of 22.9% and 10.9% during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily due to the following:GDV increased 16.1% in 2011, when measured in local currency terms, and increased 19.3% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus the comparable periods in 2010. In 2010, GDV increased 9.1% when measured in local currency terms, and increased 10.7% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus 2009.Pricing changes increased domestic assessments by approximately 5 and 4 percentage points for 2011 and 2010, respectively.The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of domestic assessments from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars favorably impacted domestic assessments revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in 2011, and impacted revenue growth by a minimal amount in 2010.Cross border volume fees There was an increase in cross border volume fees of 8.7% and 27.7% during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily due to the following:Cross border volumes increased 18.7% in 2011 when measured in local currency terms, and increased 24.2% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis, versus the comparable periods in 2010. In 2010, cross border volumes increased 15.2% when measured in local currency terms and increased 15.1% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis.Pricing changes reduced cross border revenue by approximately 11 percentage points in 2011. This decrease was due to pricing changes related to the pricing structure change implemented in October 2010 and was partially offset by pricing increases implemented during 2010. In 2010, pricing changes represented approximately a net 13 percentage points of cross border revenue growth. This increase included approximately 18 percentage points related to pricing changes implemented in October 2009, partially offset by a decrease due to the pricing structure change in October 2010. Furthermore, the October 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of June 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the European Commission had an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact on 2010 cross border revenue growth.The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of cross border volume fees from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars favorably impacted cross border volume fees revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2011, and unfavorably impacted revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in 2010.Transaction processing fees There was an increase in transaction processing fees of 18.1% and 7.6% during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily due to the following:Processed transactions increased 18.3% and 2.9% during 2011 and 2010, respectively.The effects of connectivity fees and other non switching transactions also contributed to the growth in transaction processing fees in 2011. The 2010 growth in transaction processing was partially offset from the effects of prior debit portfolio losses in the U.S. and U.K. Those debit portfolio losses impacted revenue to a lessor extent than the percentage decrease in the transactions due to the pricing of those products and portfolios.Pricing changes in 2011 had a minimal impact on processed transactions fees, while in 2010, pricing changes implemented in April 2009 represented approximately 3 percentage points of the increase. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of transaction processing fees from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars favorably impacted transaction processing fees revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in 2011, and unfavorably impacted revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010.Other revenues Other revenues increased 26.4% and 1.0% during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily due to the following:Revenues from recent acquisitions contributed approximately 13 percentage points to the increase in 2011 without comparable revenues in 2010.Increased consulting fees, fraud service fees and other payment related services in 2011.Pricing changes increased other revenues by approximately 3 percentage points in 2011 and had a minimal impact on 2010.48Table of ContentsThe net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of other revenues from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars favorably impacted other revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in 2011, and unfavorably impacted revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010.Rebates and incentives Rebates and incentives increased 10.0% and 24.8% during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 24.9%, 26.7% and 24.1% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amount of rebates and incentives increased primarily due to the following:In 2011 and 2010, higher rebates and incentives were driven by increased performance as well as certain new and renewed agreements. The Company intends to continue to enter into and maintain business agreements that provide rebates and incentives to certain customers and merchants.Pricing changes reduced rebates and incentives growth by approximately 11 percentage points in 2011, primarily due to the pricing structure change implemented in October 2010, as discussed above under Cross border volume fees." In 2010, an increase in cross border rebates, referred to below, contributed approximately 10 percentage points to the increase in rebates and incentives, partially offset by the effects of the pricing structure change in October 2010. Cross border pricing actions in October 2009 as discussed above under Cross border volume fees, included an increase to cross border rebates to encourage certain behaviors of our customers. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of rebates and incentives from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars increased rebates and incentives by approximately 1 percentage point in 2011, and had a minimal impact on rebates and incentives in 2010.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, depreciation and amortization expenses, and in 2011, the MDL Provision. Operating expenses increased $1.2 billion, or 43.6% in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to the $770 million MDL Provision and higher general and administrative expenses, including expenses related to recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the MDL Provision, operating expenses increased $445 million, or 16.0% in 2011 compared to 2010. The recent acquisitions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to the increase in operating expenses in 2011. In 2010, operating expenses decreased $52 million, or 1.8% compared to 2009, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses.The following table compares and reconciles operating expenses, excluding the MDL Provision, which is a non GAAP financial measure, to the operating expenses including the MDL Provision, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement. Management believes this analysis facilitates understanding of our ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods.

General and administrative expenses decreased $85 million, or 4.4% in 2010, compared to 2009. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of general and administrative expenses from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars increased general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2011, and reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010.49Table of ContentsThe major components of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 (in millions, except percentages)Personnel$1,453 $1,219 $1,365 19.2% (10.7)%Professional fees235 204 158 15.4% 28.9%Telecommunications67 57 69 16.8% (16.6)%Data processing104 90 86 15.7% 4.8%Travel and entertainment84 58 44 43.8% 31.7%Other253 229 220 10.8% 3.7%General and administrative expenses$2,196 $1,857 $1,942 18.3% (4.4)%Personnel expense increased 19.2% in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher salary costs, incentives and benefits costs, including increased compensation related to an increase in the number of employees to support the Companys strategic initiatives, including recent acquisitions. Personnel expense decreased 10.7% in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline was primarily due to lower severance expense of $100 million, due to a realignment of resources in 2009, lower pension and other retirement related expenses, and lower share based compensation expense, partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense. Professional fees consist primarily of third party consulting services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand. Professional fees increased 15.4% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the legal costs related to regulatory developments, consulting expenses associated with recent acquisitions and other strategic initiatives. Professional fees increased 28.9% in 2010 versus 2009 driven by costs including the evaluation and execution of acquisitions, e Commerce and other strategic initiatives. Telecommunications and data processing expense consist of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication needs. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage.Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings, business development efforts and strategic initiatives. The 2011 increase in travel and entertainment expense versus 2010 was primarily due to higher travel costs from strategic initiatives and business development efforts. The 2010 increase in travel and entertainment versus 2009 was primarily due to business development efforts. Other expenses include rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses, litigation settlements not related to the MDL Provision and other miscellaneous operating expenses. The 2011 increase in other expenses versus 2010 was primarily due to increased operational expenses in connection with the Companys strategic initiatives, including the recent acquisitions, partially offset by gains from foreign exchange risk management. The 2010 increase in other expenses versus 2009 was primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement and foreign exchange risk management related to the DataCash acquisition and the write off of an uncollectible receivable.Advertising and MarketingOur brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally. Our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global MasterCard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale. We will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. Advertising and marketing expenses increased $59 million, or 7.6% in 2011 mainly due to sponsorships and promotional initiatives. In 2010, advertising and marketing expenses increased $26 million, or 3.5% mainly due to customer specific initiatives and sponsorships. The net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of advertising and marketing expenses from our functional currencies to U.S. dollars increased advertising 50Table of Contentsand marketing expenses by approximately 2 percentage points in 2011, and reduced advertising and marketing expense by 1 percentage point in 2010.Provision for Litigation SettlementAs of December 31, 2011, the Company accrued $770 million related to the MDL Provision; the amount represents an estimate of the Companys financial liability that could result from a settlement based on progress in the mediation process. There were no comparable charges in 2010. See Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion. Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $46 million, or 31.1%, in 2011 versus 2010. The increases in depreciation and amortization expense reflected the amortization of intangible assets from recent acquisitions and increased investments in data center equipment for our global payments network.Other Income (Expense)Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses. The increase of total other income in 2011 versus 2010 of $28 million was primarily due to a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements and an adjustment to the earnout related to the Companys recent acquisition of Access (see Note 2 (Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report), partially offset by expenses from equity method investments. The increase of total other income in 2010 versus 2009 of $47 million, was primarily due to a decrease in interest expenses of $63 million resulting from a reduction in interest on litigation settlements and on uncertain tax positions.Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 30.6%, 33.0% and 34.1%, respectively. The tax rate for 2011 was lower than the tax rate for 2010 primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings, including the tax benefit related to the MDL Provision, and the recognition of discrete adjustments in 2011 and 2010. The tax rate for 2010 was lower than the tax rate in 2009 primarily due to the 2010 impact of actual and anticipated repatriations from foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by discrete adjustments in 2010 and 2009. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax income for the years ended December 31, as a result of the following: For the years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (in millions, except percentages)Income before income tax expense $2,746 $2,757 $2,218 Federal statutory tax 961 35.0 % 965 35.0 % 776 35.0 %State tax effect, net of federal benefit 14 0.5 % 19 0.7 % 25 1.1 %Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit (133) (4.9)% (24) (0.9)% (22) (1.0)%Non deductible expenses and other differences 34 1.2 % 23 0.9 % (18) (0.7)%Tax exempt income (3) (0.1)% (5) (0.2)% (6) (0.3)%Foreign repatriation (31) (1.1)% (68) (2.5)% %Income tax expense $842 30.6 % $910 33.0 % $755 34.1 % 51Table of ContentsThe Companys GAAP effective tax rate for 2011 was affected by the tax benefits related to the MDL Provision. Due to the non recurring nature of this item, the Company believes that the calculation of the 2011 effective tax rate excluding the impact of the MDL Provision facilitates meaningful comparison of effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010. GAAP to Non GAAP effective tax rate reconciliation For the year ended December, 31 2011 Actual MDL Provision Non GAAP (in millions, except percentages)Income before income taxes$2,746 $770 $3,516Income tax expense(842) (275) (1,117)Loss attributable to non controlling interests2 2Net income attributable to MasterCard$1,906 $495 $2,401 Effective tax rate30.6% 31.8%During 2011, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by $49 million. The increase in the Companys unrecognized tax benefits for 2011 is primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were $214 million, all of which would reduce the Companys effective tax rate if recognized.In 2010, in connection with the expansion of the Companys operations in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, the Companys subsidiary in Singapore, MasterCard Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (MAPPL), received an incentive grant from the Singapore Ministry of Finance, at the recommendation of the Singapore Economic Development Board. See Note 19 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures, to make continued investments in our business and to service our potential litigation obligations. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we had $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale securities to use for our operations. In September 2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its Class A common stock in open market transactions. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this plan during 2010. In April 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase an incremental $1 billion of its Class A common stock in open market transactions. The incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization increases the Class A share repurchase program to an aggregate of $2 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2011, MasterCard repurchased a total of approximately 4.4 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $258.92 per share of Class A common stock. These repurchased shares are considered treasury stock. As of January 27, 2012, the cumulative repurchases by the Company under the share repurchase program totaled approximately 4.7 million shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $1.3 billion at an average price of $264.65 per share of Class A common stock. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.The Company believes that its existing cash balances, its cash flow generating capabilities, its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential litigation obligations. Cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to U.S. tax upon repatriation) was $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, or 37% and 28% of our total cash and cash equivalents and current available for sale investment securities as of such dates. It is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 outside of the United States (as disclosed in Note 19 (Income Tax) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings. If these earnings are needed for U.S operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the United States, the Company would be subject to U.S. tax upon repatriation.52Table of ContentsOur liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions and the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in Part I, Item 1A; Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report; and Business Environment in Part II, Item 7 of this Report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business. Additionally, our liquidity could be affected by the failure of customers to meet their settlement obligations. See Note 21 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion.Cash FlowThe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities$2,684 $1,697 $1,378Net cash used in investing activities(748) (641) (664)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(1,215) 19 (185)The table below shows a summary of the balance sheet data at December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Balance Sheet Data: Current assets$7,741 $6,454 $5,003Current liabilities4,217 3,143 3,167Long term liabilities599 478 791Equity5,877 5,216 3,512Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2.7 billion versus $1.7 billion for the comparable period in 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to net income and the increase in accrued litigation related to the $770 million MDL Provision, partially offset by litigation settlement payments of $303 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to net income, partially offset by litigation settlement payments.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily related to purchases of investment securities, the acquisition of Access and expenditures for our global payments network, partially offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to the DataCash acquisition and expenditures for our global payments network, partially offset by net cash inflows from investment security activities.Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily related to the repurchase of the Companys Class A common stock and dividend payments to our stockholders. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to the tax benefit from share based compensation, partially offset by dividend payments to our stockholders.DividendsOn December 6, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on February 9, 2012 to holders of record on January 9, 2012 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is $19 million. On February 7, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share payable on May 9, 2012 to holders of record on April 9, 2012 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $38 million. Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs. 53Table of ContentsCredit AvailabilityOn November 22, 2011, the Company extended its committed unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of November 22, 2010 (the Credit Facility), for an additional year. The new expiration date of the Credit Facility is November 21, 2014. The available funding under the Credit Facility will remain at $2.75 billion through November 22, 2013 and then decrease to $2.35 billion during the final year of the Credit Facility agreement. Other terms and conditions in the Credit Facility remain unchanged. The Companys option to request that each lender under the Credit Facility extend its commitment was provided pursuant to the original terms of the Credit Facility agreement. MasterCard had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the Companys customers. In addition, for business continuity planning and related purposes, we may borrow and repay amounts under the Credit Facility from time to time. The facility fee and borrowing cost under the Credit Facility are contingent upon the Companys credit rating. At December 31, 2011, the applicable facility fee was 20 basis points on the average daily commitment (whether or not utilized). In addition to the facility fee, interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin of 130 basis points or an alternate base rate plus 30 basis points. The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum level of consolidated debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) financial covenant and events of default. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard.On November 4, 2009, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital, if needed. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the Company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, preferred stock or Class A common stock in one or more offerings.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than settlement guarantees issued in the normal course of business, it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 21 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. MasterCard has no off balance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented below in the future obligations table.54Table of ContentsFuture ObligationsThe following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2011 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total 6 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 andthereafter (in millions) Capital leases 1$51 $6 $45 $ $Operating leases 294 22 31 22 19Sponsorship, licensing and other 3, 4, 5600 314 207 73 6Total$745 $342 $283 $95 $25 1. Mostly related to certain property, plant and equipment. The capital lease for the global technology and operations center located in OFallon, Missouri has been excluded from this table, see Note 8 (Property, Plant and Equipment) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. There is a capital lease for the Kansas City, Missouri co processing data center.2. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements.3. Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $889 million as of December 31, 2011 related to customer and merchant agreements.4. Includes current liability of $2 million relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non current liabilities for uncertainties in income taxes, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority.5. Includes current liability of $4 million relating to amounts due in accordance with litigation and regulatory settlements.6. The table does not include the $770 million accrued as of December 31, 2011 related to the MDL Provision; the accrual is an estimate of the Companys financial liability that could result from a settlement based on progress in the mediation process. See Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion.SeasonalityOur fourth quarter results typically include higher customer and merchant incentives, which are recorded as contra revenue, due to higher contract renewal activity and increased purchase volume and promotional activity related to the holiday shopping period, generally reducing our net revenue. The fourth quarter also generally includes increased advertising and marketing expenses, primarily due to promotional activity related to the holiday shopping period and the timing of advertising and promotional campaigns. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. 55Table of ContentsFinancial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Domestic assessments require an estimate of our customers quarterly GDV or GEV to recognize quarterly domestic assessments.In 2011, domestic assessments included an estimate representing 14% and 7% of total domestic assessments and total net revenues, respectively. Domestic assessments included an estimate representing 13% and 6% of total domestic assessments and total net revenues in both 2010 and 2009.Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Customers GDV and GEV are estimated by using historical performance, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers.Such estimates are subsequently validated against the GDV or GEV reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. If customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, realized revenues may be materially different than initially estimated. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customers performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. Examples of the customer performance items requiring estimation include GDV or GEV, transactions, issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. In addition, certain customer agreements include prepayment of rebates and incentives. Amortization of prepayments and other assets may be on the straight line basis over the life of the agreement or based on customer performance depending on the terms of the related customer agreements. Our estimates of each customers performance are based on historical customer performance, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers.Such estimates are subsequently validated by information reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. If customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated. 56Table of ContentsFinancial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings. We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, the Company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions. We do not record U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations. We consider business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. If our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, U.S. income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period. 57Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Asset Impairment Analyses Prepaid Customer and Merchant IncentivesWe prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives. In the event of customer or merchant business failure, these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business.Impairment analysis is performed quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment analysis for each customer requires an estimation of our customers future performance and an assessment of the agreement terms to determine the future net cash flows expected from the customer agreement. Our estimates of customer performance are based on historical customer performance, discussions with our customer and our expectations for the future. If events or changes in circumstances occur, additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred. The carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was $471 million at December 31, 2011. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (excluding Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.Goodwill and intangible assets are assigned to our reporting units. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. Our goodwill policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. When performing our annual goodwill impairment test, we utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to, macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company specific events, and fair value history.When reviewing intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment, we exercise significant judgment using internally generated data to estimate future cash flows. If market conditions or business conditions change in the future, we may be exposed to impairment charges associated with goodwill and or intangible assets. The net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $1.4 billion, including $189 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2011.We determined that the majority of our customer relationships, which are intangible assets, have indefinite lives. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We use internal data and estimates regarding changes in our customer relationships and future cash flows to assess the indefinite life and assess fair value. If a definite life is deemed to be more appropriate, it would require amortization of the customer relationships which would result in a reduction of future net income.58Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsRevenue arrangements with multiple deliverables In September 2009, the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended. Current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable, even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors. The new accounting standard eliminates (i) the residual method of revenue allocation and (ii) the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. The Company adopted the revised accounting standard effective January 1, 2011 via prospective adoption. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Fair value measurement and disclosure The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company classifies these recurring fair value measurements into a three level hierarchy ("Valuation Hierarchy") and discloses the significant assumptions utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. In January 2010, fair value disclosure requirements were amended to require detailed disclosures about transfers to and from Level 1 and 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy effective January 1, 2010 and disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a "gross" basis within the Level 3 (of the Valuation Hierarchy) reconciliation effective January 1, 2011. The Company adopted the new guidance for disclosures about transfers to and from Level 1 and 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy effective January 1, 2010. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company adopted the guidance that requires disclosure of a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a "gross" basis within Level 3 (of the Valuation Hierarchy) effective January 1, 2011, as required, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.In May 2011, the fair value accounting standard was amended to change fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements. The key changes in measurement principles include limiting the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise to nonfinancial assets, providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement, and aligning the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entitys shareholders equity with the guidance for liabilities. Disclosures will be required for all transfers between Levels 1 and 2 within the Valuation Hierarchy, the use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use, the level in the Valuation Hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed, and for Level 3 measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements. The Company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective January 1, 2012 via prospective adoption, as required, and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.Disclosure about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses In July 2010, a new accounting standard was issued that requires companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including, but not limited to, significant purchases and sales of financing receivables, aging information and credit quality indicators. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2011, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.Impairment testing for goodwill In December 2010, a new accounting standard was issued that requires Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to be performed for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The provisions for this pronouncement are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, with no early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2011, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.In September 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that is intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. Entities are permitted to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the revised accounting standard effective October 1, 2011. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.Business combinations In December 2010, a new accounting standard was issued that requires a company to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred 59Table of Contentsas of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, only when comparative financial statements are presented. The disclosure provisions are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2011, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.Comprehensive income In June 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income: (1) in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income. Also, items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements. In December 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that indefinitely defers the effective date for the requirement to present the reclassification of items from comprehensive income to net income. Both standards require retrospective application, and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt the revised accounting standards effective January 1, 2012, and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2011 as compared to December 31, 2010. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments and the Company is determining what impact, if any, such provisions will have on the Companys financial position or results of operations.Foreign Exchange RiskWe enter into forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into forward contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months.As of December 31, 2011, all contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency had been entered into with customers of MasterCard. MasterCards derivative contracts are summarized below: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Notional Estimated FairValue 1 Notional Estimated FairValue 1 (in millions)Commitments to purchase foreign currency$21 $ $38 $1Commitments to sell foreign currency279 2 148 (2)1 Amounts represent gross fair value amounts while these amounts may be netted for actual balance sheet presentation.Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the typical one business day time frame between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of 17 other transaction currencies. The remaining 133 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure.60Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities, which we generally hold as available for sale investments. Our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. The fair value and maturity distribution of the Companys available for sale investments as of December 31 was as follows: Maturity (in millions) (in millions) Fair Market Value at December 31, 2011 2017 and there afterFinancial Instrument Summary Terms 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Municipal securities Fixed / Variable Interest $393 $109 $74 $62 $59 $40 $49Corporate securities Fixed / Variable Interest 325 146 91 88 U.S. Government and Agency securities Fixed / Variable Interest 205 176 15 3 4 3 4Taxable short term bond funds Fixed / Variable Interest1 2031 Asset backed securities Fixed / Variable Interest 69 43 24 2 Auction rate securities Variable Interest 70 70Other Fixed / Variable Interest 20 16 4 Total $1,285 $490 $208 $155 $63 $43 $1231 Short term bond funds of $203 million have no contractual maturity.

At December 31, 2011, we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the Companys customers. This credit facility has variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. We had no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2011 or 2010. See Note 13 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional information.Equity Price RiskThe Company did not have significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. 61Table of Contents
