ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended December 28, 2001, December 29, 2000, and December 31, 1999. Revenue per available room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. We consider REVPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. Comparable REVPAR, room rate and occupancy statistics used throughout this report are based on U.S. properties operated by us except for Fairfield Inn, which data also include franchised units. Systemwide sales and statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. Systemwide statistics are based on comparable worldwide units and reflect the impact of foreign exchange rates. Consolidated Results Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The Company has experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy. This decline has resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. We have responded by implementing certain companywide cost saving measures, although we do not expect significant changes to the scope of our operations. As a result of our restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded pretax restructuring costs of $124 million, including (1) $16 million in severance costs; (2) $20 million, primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel; (3) $28 million related to the write off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable; and (4) $60 million related to the write down of the Village Oaks brand of companion style senior living communities, which are now classified as held for sale, to their estimated fair value. Detailed information related to the restructuring costs and other charges, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the economic downturn and the unfavorable lodging environment, is provided below. Restructuring Costs Severance Our restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of approximately 1,700 employees (the majority of which were terminated by December 28, 2001) across our operations. We recorded a workforce reduction charge of $16 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits. The charge does not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property level severance costs. In addition, we delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours. Facilities Exit Costs As a result of the workforce reduction and delay in filling vacant positions, we consolidated excess corporate facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $15 million for excess corporate facilities, primarily related to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In addition, we recorded a $5 million charge for lease terminations resulting from cancellations of leased units by our corporate apartment business, primarily in downtown New York City. Development Cancellations and Elimination of Product Line We incur certain costs associated with the development of properties, including legal costs, the cost of land and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the dramatic downturn in the economy in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, we decided to cancel development projects that were no longer deemed viable. As a result, we expensed $28 million of previously capitalized costs. In addition, management has begun to actively engage in efforts to sell 25 Village Oaks senior living communities. These communities offer companion living and are significantly different from our other senior living brands. As a result of the plan to exit this line of business, the 13 assets associated with the 25 properties have been reclassified as assets held for sale and have accordingly been recorded at their estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of $60 million. Other Charges Reserves for Guarantees and Loan Losses We issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of the downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners have not been able to meet debt service obligations to the Company or in some cases, to other third party lending institutions. As a result, based upon cash flow projections, we expect to fund under certain guarantees, which are not deemed recoverable, and we expect that several of the loans made by us will not be repaid according to their original terms. Due to the expected guarantee fundings deemed non recoverable and the expected loan losses, we recorded charges of $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Accounts Receivable Bad Debts In the fourth quarter of 2001, we reserved $17 million of accounts receivable following an analysis of these accounts which we deemed uncollectible, generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment. Asset Impairments The Company recorded a charge related to the impairment of an investment in a technology related joint venture ($22 million), losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties ($13 million), write offs of investments in management contracts and other assets ($8 million), and the write off of capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform ($2 million). A summary of the restructuring costs and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 is detailed as follows ($ in millions): Cash Restructuring costs payments in and other charges Non cash fourth quarter liability at Total charge charge 2001 December 28, 2001 Severance ......................................... $ 16 $ 2 $ 6 $ 8 Facilities exit costs ............................. 20 2 18 Development cancellations and elimination of product line .................... 88 88 Total restructuring costs ......................... 124 90 8 26 Reserves for guarantees and loan losses ..................................... 85 52 33 Accounts receivable bad debts ................... 17 17 Write down of properties held for sale ............ 13 13 Impairment of technology related investments and other ........................... 32 31 1 Total ............................................. $ 271 $ 203 $ 8 $ 60 14 The remaining liability related to the workforce reduction and fundings under guarantees will be substantially paid by the end of 2002.

Net income was primarily impacted by pretax restructuring and other charges totaling $271 million and lower lodging operating profits due to the decline in hotel performance. Sales of $10 billion in 2001 were flat compared to last year, reflecting a decline in hotel performance, partially offset by revenue from new Lodging and Distribution Services business and contributions from established Senior Living communities. Systemwide sales increased slightly to $20 billion. 2000 Compared to 1999 Net income increased 20 percent to $479 million and diluted earnings per share advanced 25 percent to $1.89. Profit growth was driven by our strong U.S. lodging operations, lower system related costs associated with the year 2000 and the impact on the 1999 financial results of a $39 million pretax charge to reflect a litigation settlement. Results were also impacted by a $15 million one time write off of a contract investment in our Distribution Services segment in the first quarter of 2000. 15 Sales increased 15 percent to $10 billion in 2000, reflecting strong revenue resulting from new and established hotels, contributions from established Senior Living communities, as well as new customers in our Distribution Services business. Systemwide sales increased by 12 percent to $19.8 billion in 2000. Marriott Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 2001/2000 2000/1999 Sales ............................... $7,786 $7,911 $7,041 2% +12% Operating profit before restructuring costs and other charges ..................... 756 936 827 19% +13% Restructuring costs .................

(71) nm Operating profit, as reported ....... $ 641 $ 936 $ 827 32% +13% 2001 Compared to 2000 Marriott Lodging, which includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported a 32 percent decrease in operating profit and 2 percent lower sales in 2001. Results reflected restructuring costs of $44 million and other charges of $71 million, including a $36 million reserve for third party guarantees we expect to fund and not recover out of future cash flow, $12 million of reserves for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible, a write off of two investments in management contracts and other assets of $8 million, $13 million of losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties, and a $2 million write off associated with capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform. Results also reflect lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms, partially offset by increased revenue associated with new properties. Lodging management and franchise fee revenue declined 12 percent in 2001. Incentive fee revenue declined 36 percent, base fees revenue declined 3 percent, and franchise fee revenue increased 6 percent. Lodging operating profit in 2001 (including overhead but excluding restructuring costs and other charges) was attributable to base management fees (33 percent of total), franchise fees (21 percent) and land rent (3 percent) that are based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. The balance was attributable to our timesharing business (20 percent), and to incentive management fees and other income based on the profits of the underlying properties (23 percent). 16 Across our Lodging brands, REVPAR for comparable company operated U.S. properties declined by an average of 10.4 percent in 2001. Average room rates for these hotels declined 2 percent and occupancy declined 6.7 percentage points. Occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table.

Operating profit increased 7 percent, reflecting a 22 percent increase in contract sales, the 2001 acquisition of the Grand Residence Club in Lake Tahoe, California, and note sale gains in 2001 of $40 million compared to $22 million in 2000, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and severance expenses of nearly $2 million associated with the Companys restructuring plan. International Lodging reported a decrease in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the decline in international travel and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by sales associated with new rooms. Over 35 percent of rooms added in 2001 were outside the United States. 17 Lodging Development Marriott Lodging opened 313 properties totaling nearly 50,000 rooms across its brands in 2001, while 14 hotels (approximately 3,700 rooms) exited the system. Highlights of the year included: . Over 35 percent of new rooms opened were outside the United States. These include our first hotels in Belgium, Denmark and Ireland. . Development of a new Marriott Vacation Club International resort in Phuket, Thailand, the EuroDisney resort, and the acquisition of The Grand Residence Club property in Lake Tahoe, California. . One hundred and fifty properties (19,100 rooms) were added to our select service and extended stay brands. . One hundred and forty four properties (19,300 rooms), 39 percent of our total room additions for the year, were conversions from other brands. At year end 2001, we had over 300 hotel properties and more than 55,000 rooms under construction or approved for development. We expect to open over 150 hotels and timesharing resorts (25,000 30,000 rooms) in 2002. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. See "Forward Looking Statements" above and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Marriott Lodging reported a 13 percent increase in operating profit on 12 percent higher sales in 2000. Results reflected solid room rate growth at U.S. hotels and contributions from new properties worldwide. Lodging operating profit in 2000 was attributable to base management fees (28 percent of total), franchise fees (17 percent), land rent and other income (3 percent), resort timesharing (15 percent), and incentive management fees and other profit participations (37 percent). Across our full service lodging brands (Marriott Hotels, Resorts and Suites; Renaissance Hotels, Resorts and Suites; and The Ritz Carlton Hotels), REVPAR for comparable company operated U.S. properties grew by an average of 7.2 percent in 2000. Average room rates for these hotels rose 6.3 percent, while occupancy increased slightly to 77.4 percent. In 2000, as a result of the termination of two Ritz Carlton management agreements, we wrote off our $3 million 18 investment in these contracts. In addition, due to the bankruptcy of the owner of one hotel, we reserved $6 million of our investment in that management agreement. Our domestic select service and extended stay brands (Residence Inn, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, TownePlace Suites and SpringHill Suites) added a total of 161 properties (18,870 rooms) and deflagged seven properties (1,500 rooms), primarily franchises, during the 2000 fiscal year. REVPAR for comparable properties increased 5.5 percent.

Marriott Vacation Club International also posted favorable profit growth in 2000, reporting a 34 percent increase in contract sales. The increase in contract sales reflects interest in our newest brands, Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club in Orlando, Florida, and The Ritz Carlton Club resorts in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Aspen, Colorado, as well as continued strong demand for our timeshare properties in Hawaii, Aruba and California. The profit growth in 2000 was impacted by a $6 million decline in gains from the sale of notes receivable arising from lower note sale volume. At the end of the year, 24 resorts were in active sales, 23 resorts were sold out and an additional 13 resorts were under development. 19 The Marketplace by Marriott (Marketplace), our hospitality procurement business, launched as an independent company. In January 2001, Marriott and Hyatt Corporation formed a joint venture, Avendra LLC, and we each merged our respective procurement businesses into it. Avendra LLC is an independent professional procurement services company serving the North American hospitality market and related industries. Bass Hotels & Resorts, Inc., ClubCorp USA Inc. and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, Inc. joined Avendra LLC in March 2001.

Occupancy for comparable communities increased by nearly 2 percent to 85.3 percent in 2001. The division reported an operating loss of $45 million, reflecting restructuring and other charges of $62 million, primarily related to the $60 million write down of 25 senior living communities held for sale to their estimated fair value and the write off of a $2 million receivable no longer deemed collectible. These charges were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in comparable occupancy and the new units. 2000 Compared to 1999 Marriott Senior Living Services posted a 20 percent increase in sales in 2000, reflecting the net addition of nine properties during the year and a 4 percentage point increase in occupancy for comparable communities to 88 percent. Despite the increase in sales, profitability was impacted by start up inefficiencies for new properties, higher administrative expenses, pre opening costs for new communities, costs related to debt associated with facilities developed by unaffiliated third parties, and charges associated with our decision to limit new construction until the market improves, resulting in a loss of $18 million. Senior Living Services Development Due to oversupply conditions in some senior housing markets, we decided in 1999 to dramatically slow development of planned communities. Consequently, a number of projects in the early stages of development were postponed or canceled. Additional projects were canceled in 2000. 20 Marriott Distribution Services Annual Change ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 2001/2000 2000/1999 Sales ........................ $1,637 $1,500 $1,139 +9% +32% Operating (loss) Profit before restructuring costs and other charges ............

The impact of higher sales on the operating results was more than offset by the decline in business from one significant customer, transportation inefficiencies and restructuring and other charges of $5 million, including severance costs and the write off of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2001. The Company commenced a strategic review of this business in January 2002. 2000 Compared to 1999 Marriott Distribution Services posted a 32 percent increase in sales for 2000, reflecting the commencement of service to three large restaurant chains in the year. Operating profit declined $17 million as a result of start up inefficiencies associated with the new business and a $15 million pretax write off of an investment in a contract with Boston Chicken, Inc. and its Boston Market controlled subsidiaries, a major customer that filed for bankruptcy in October 1998. McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds) acquired Boston Market in 2000, and during the first quarter of 2000, MDS entered into an agreement with McDonalds to continue providing distribution services to Boston Market restaurants (refer to the "Intangible Assets" footnote in the financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"). Corporate Expenses, Interest and Taxes Corporate Expenses Annual Change ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 2001/2000 2000/1999 Corporate expenses before restructuring costs and other charges ....................... $117 $120 $164 3% 27% Restructuring costs .............. 18 nm Other charges .................... 22 nm Corporate expenses, as reported .. $157 $120 $164 +31% 27% 2001 Compared to 2000 Corporate expenses increased $37 million reflecting the impact of restructuring charges of $18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs, and other charges related to the fourth quarter write off of a $22 million investment in one of our technology partners. In addition to these items, we also recorded $8 million of foreign exchange losses and in prior quarters we recorded a $13 million write off of two investments in technology partners. These charges were partially offset by $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing tax credit investments, the favorable impact of cost containment action plans, and the reversal of a long standing $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our managed hotels. The reversal of the insurance reserve was the result of us being approached in the first quarter by the plaintiffs counsel, who indicated that a settlement could be reached in an amount that would be covered by insurance. We determined that it was no longer probable that the loss contingency would result in a material outlay by us and accordingly, we reversed the reserve during the first quarter of 2001. 21 2000 Compared to 1999 Corporate expenses decreased $44 million in 2000 to $120 million primarily due to a $39 million pretax charge in 1999 associated with a litigation settlement and systems related costs associated with Year 2000 that were incurred in 1999, offset by costs incurred in 2000 associated with new corporate systems and a $3 million charge due to a change in our vacation accrual policy. Interest Expense 2001 Compared to 2000 Interest expense increased $9 million to $109 million reflecting the impact of the issuance of Series E Notes in January 2001 and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, partially offset by lower interest resulting from the payoff of commercial paper. 2000 Compared to 1999 Interest expense increased $39 million as a result of borrowings to finance growth outlays and share repurchases. Interest Income and Income Tax 2001 Compared to 2000 Interest income increased $34 million, before reflecting reserves of $48 million for loans deemed uncollectible as a result of certain hotels experiencing significant declines in profitability and the owners not being able to meet debt service obligations. The change in interest income was impacted by income associated with higher loan balances, including the loans made to the Courtyard joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset by $5 million of expected guarantee fundings and the impact of $14 million of income recorded in 2000 associated with an international loan that was previously deemed uncollectible. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.2 percent in 2001 from 36.8 percent in 2000 as a result of modifications related to our deferred compensation plan and the impact of increased income in countries with lower effective tax rates. 2000 Compared to 1999 Interest income increased $23 million primarily due to the collection of $14 million of interest associated with an international loan that was previously reserved for and increased advances and loan fundings made during 2000. Our effective income tax rate decreased to approximately 36.8 percent in 2000 from 37.3 percent in 1999 primarily due to increased income in countries with lower effective tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have credit facilities which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At December 28, 2001, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities was nearly $2 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash expected to be generated by operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, to finance our long term growth plans, and to meet debt service and other cash requirements. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If the lodging industry recovers more slowly than we anticipate, our ability to obtain commercial paper borrowings at competitive rates may be impaired. Cash from Operations Cash from operations was $400 million in 2001, $850 million in 2000, and $711 million in 1999. Net income is stated after depreciation expense of $142 million in 2001, $123 million in 2000, and $96 million in 1999, and after 22 amortization expense of $80 million in 2001, $72 million in 2000, and $66 million in 1999. While our timesharing business generates strong operating cash flow, annual amounts are affected by the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts, and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) decreased to $701 million in 2001 compared to $1,052 million in 2000, and $860 million in 1999. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. Nevertheless, you should not consider EBITDA an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash flows from operations, or any other operating or liquidity measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A substantial portion of our EBITDA is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. These include lodging base management fees, franchise fees and land rent. With over 2,500 hotels and senior living communities in the Marriott system, no single property or region is critical to our financial results. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.2 at December 28, 2001, compared to .9 at December 29, 2000. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. In 2001 we securitized $199 million of notes by selling notes receivable originated by our timeshare business to special purpose entities. We recognized gains on these sales of $40 million in the year ended December 28, 2001. Our ability to continue to sell notes to such off balance sheet entities depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the entities buying the notes. Also, our ability to continue to consummate such securitizations would be impacted if the underlying quality of the notes receivable originated by us were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. In connection with these securitization transactions, at December 28, 2001, we had repurchase obligations of $46 million related to previously sold notes receivable, although we expect to incur no material losses in respect of those obligations. We retain interests in the securitizations which are accounted for as interest only strips, and in the year ended December 28, 2001, we received cash flows of $30 million arising from those retained interests. At December 28, 2001, the special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of $499 million. While our timesharing business generates strong operating cash flow, annual amounts are affected by the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts, and cash received from purchaser financing. We include interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or when the notes are sold for cash. Investing Activities Cash Flows Acquisitions. We continually seek opportunities to enter new markets, increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions. Dispositions. Asset sales generated proceeds of $554 million in 2001, $742 million in 2000 and $436 million in 1999. Proceeds in 2001 are net of $109 million of financing and joint venture investments made by us in connection with the sales transactions. In 2001 we closed on the sales of 18 hotels and one senior living community, most of which we continue to operate under long term operating agreements. Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $560 million in 2001, $1,095 million in 2000, and $929 million in 1999 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties. Over time, we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development, or to be developed, while continuing to operate them under long term agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry, and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. 23 We also expect to continue to make other investments to grow our businesses, including loans, minority equity investments and development of new timeshare resorts in connection with adding units to our lodging business. On February 23, 2000, we entered into an agreement to resolve litigation involving certain limited partnerships formed in the mid to late 1980s. Under the agreement, we paid $31 million to partners in four limited partnerships and acquired, through an unconsolidated joint venture (the Courtyard Joint Venture) with affiliates of Host Marriott Corporation (Host Marriott), substantially all of the limited partners interests in two other limited partnerships, Courtyard by Marriott Limited Partnership (CBM I) and Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership (CBM II). These partnerships own 120 Courtyard by Marriott hotels. The Courtyard Joint Venture was financed with equity contributed in equal shares by us and affiliates of Host Marriott and approximately $200 million in mezzanine debt provided by us. Our total investment in the joint venture, including mezzanine debt, is approximately $300 million. In early 2000, the Company estimated the amount of the planned investment in the Courtyard Joint Venture based upon (1) estimated post acquisition cash flows, including anticipated changes in the related hotel management agreements to be made contemporaneously with the investment; (2) the investees new capital structure; and (3) estimates of prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates reflected in the market at that time. The investment in the Courtyard Joint Venture was consummated late in the fourth quarter of 2000. For purposes of purchase accounting, the Courtyard Joint Venture valued its investment in the partnership units based on (1) pre acquisition cash flows; (2) the pre acquisition capital structure; and (3) prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates in December 2000. Due to a number of factors, the equity values used in the purchase accounting for the Courtyard Joint Ventures investment were different than limited partner unit estimates included in the CBM I and CBM II Purchase Offer and Consent Solicitations (the Solicitations). At a 20 percent discount rate, the combined CBM I and CBM II estimates reflected in the Solicitations totaled $254 million. In the purchase accounting, the corresponding equity value in the Courtyard Joint Venture totaled $372 million. The principal differences between these two amounts are attributed to the following: (1) the investment was consummated almost one year subsequent to the time the original estimates were prepared ($30 million); and (2) a lower discount rate (17 percent) and capitalization rate reflecting changes in market conditions versus the date at which the estimates in the solicitations were prepared ($79 million). The Company assessed its potential investment and any potential loss on settlement based on post acquisition cash flows. The purchase accounting was based on pre acquisition cash flows and capital structure. As a result, the factors giving rise to the differences outlined above did not materially impact the Companys previous assessment of any expense related to litigation. The post settlement equity of the Joint Venture is considerably lower then the pre acquisition equity due to additional indebtedness post acquisition and the impact of changes to the management agreements made contemporaneously with the transaction. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging businesses because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel sales values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. We have made loans to owners of hotels and senior living communities that we operate or franchise. Loans outstanding under this program, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $860 million at December 28, 2001, $592 million at December 29, 2000, and $295 million at December 31, 1999. The balance at December 28, 2001, is stated net of the reserve arising from the $43 million charge discussed in the restructuring costs and other charges note. Unfunded commitments aggregating $669 million were outstanding at December 28, 2001, of which $187 million are expected to be funded in 2002 and $334 million are expected to be funded in total. We participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third party ownership of hotels and senior living services communities that we operate or franchise. Synthetic Fuel. In October 2001, we acquired four coal based synthetic fuel production facilities (the Facilities) for $46 million in cash. The synthetic fuel produced at the Facilities qualifies for tax credits based on Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Section 29, tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel produced after 2007. We currently plan to commence operation of the Facilities in 2002. We anticipate that the operation of the Facilities, together with the benefit arising from the tax credits will be significantly accretive to our net income. The operations of the Facilities are expected to produce significant operating losses, although we anticipate that these will be offset by the tax credits generated under Section 29, which we expect to reduce our income tax expense. We expect that the 24 Facilities will be disclosed as a separate segment in our consolidated financial statements while operating in 2002 through 2007, and at that point we do not expect to report the Facilities as a separate segment as we do not expect it to be material. Cash from Financing Activities Long term debt, including convertible debt, increased by $799 million in 2001 and $340 million in 2000, primarily due to borrowings to finance our capital expenditure and share repurchase programs, and to maintain excess cash reserves totaling $645 million in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2001, our long term debt, excluding convertible debt, had an average interest rate of 5.2 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.2 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was .58 as of December 28, 2001. In April 1999, January 2000 and January 2001, we filed "universal shelf" registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the amounts of $500 million, $300 million and $300 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2002, we had offered and sold to the public under these registration statements, $300 million of debt securities at 7 7/8 %, due 2009 and $300 million at 8 1/8 %, due 2005, leaving a balance of $500 million available for future offerings. In January 2001, we issued, through a private placement, $300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008, and received net proceeds of $297 million. We agreed to make and complete a registered exchange offer for these notes, and completed that exchange offer on January 15, 2002. We are a party to revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of $1.5 billion expiring in July 2006, and $500 million expiring in February 2004, which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. Loans of $923 million were outstanding at December 28, 2001, under these facilities. The large balance under these facilities at year end was due in part to our decision to draw down funds due to our desire to maintain excess cash reserves in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Such fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. In 1999 we called for mandatory redemption of Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs) that were issued in 1996. Approximately 64 percent of LYONs holders elected to convert their notes to common stock, for which we issued 6.1 million shares. The other 36 percent of LYONs holders received cash totaling $120 million, which reduced by 3.4 million common shares the dilutive impact of these convertible debt securities issued by a predecessor company in 1996. Nine percent of the cash redemption price was reimbursed to us by our predecessor company (Sodexho Marriott Services, Inc.). On May 8, 2001, we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021, also known as LYONs, and received cash proceeds of $405 million. The LYONs are convertible into approximately 6.4 million shares of our Class A common stock and carry a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent. Holders of the LYONs have the option to redeem them on May 8 of each of 2002, 2004, 2011 and 2016 at their then accreted value. We have adequate credit facilities committed to satisfy this obligation if it occurs in 2002. We may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash and or shares of our Class A Common Stock. We determine our debt capacity based on the amount and variability of our cash flows. EBITDA coverage of gross interest cost was 4.1 times in 2001, and we met the cash flow requirements under our loan agreements. At December 28, 2001, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ and Baa2 from Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. 25 Our contractual obligations and commitments are as summarized in the following tables ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 Contractual Obligations Total year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years ($ in millions) Long Term Debt .................... $2,451 $ 43 $255 $1,433 $ 720 Operating Leases Recourse ....................... 1,473 173 262 198 840 Non recourse ................... 717 10 82 119 506 Total Contractual Cash Obligations .................... $4,641 $226 $599 $1,750 $2,066 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Total Amounts Less than 1 Commitments Committed year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years ($ in millions) Guarantees .................. $574 $93 $139 $327 $15 Timeshare note repurchase obligations .............. 46 1 45 Total ....................... $620 $93 $140 $327 $60 Total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $669 million at December 28, 2001. We expect to fund $187 million within one year, $124 million in one to three years, and $23 million in four to five years. We do not expect to fund the remaining $335 million commitments, which expire as follows: $15 million within one year; $16 million in one to three years; $4 million in four to five years; and $300 million after five years. Share Repurchases. We periodically repurchase our common stock to replace shares needed for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. We purchased 6.1 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of $38.20 per share and 10.8 million of our shares in 2000 at an average price of $31 per share. As of December 28, 2001, we had been authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase an additional 13.5 million shares. Dividends. In May 2001, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8 percent to $.065 per share. Other Matters Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years, and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Critical Accounting Policies Certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters. Our accounting policies are in compliance with principles generally accepted in the United States, although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact. We have listed below those policies which we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. Incentive Fees We recognize base fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract. In interim periods, we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. If we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying full year performance thresholds were certain, the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged, but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter. We recognized incentive fees revenue of $202 million, $316 million and $268 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 26 Other Revenues from Managed Properties For properties that we manage, we are responsible to employees for salaries and wages and to subcontractors and other creditors for materials and services. We also have the discretionary responsibility to procure and manage the resources in performing our services under these contracts. We, therefore, include these costs and the reimbursement of the costs as part of our expenses and revenues. We recorded other revenues from properties managed by us of $5.6 billion in both 2001 and 2000 and $5.2 billion in 1999. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate." Gains on sales of real estate are reduced by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $16 million in 2001, $18 million in 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under FAS No. 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules. Timeshare Sales We also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with FAS No. 66. We recognize sales when a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval has been received, the period of cancellation with refund has expired, receivables are deemed collectible and certain minimum sales and construction levels have been attained. For sales that do not meet these criteria, we defer all revenue using the percentage of completion or the deposit method as applicable. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until the sales are recognized. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No. 67, "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects." Selling and marketing costs capitalized under this approach were approximately $126 million and $95 million at December 28, 2001, and December 29, 2000, respectively, and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a contract is canceled, unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs are charged to expense, and deposits forfeited are recorded as income. Interest Only Strips We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our timeshare business in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals. We retain servicing assets and interests in the assets transferred to special purpose entities which are accounted for as interest only strips. The interest only strips are treated as "Trading" or "Available for Sale" securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." We report changes in the fair values of the interest only strips through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for available for sale securities. We had interest only strips of $87 million at December 28, 2001 and $67 million at December 29, 2000. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At December 28, 2001, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $110 million. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2001 our allowance for credit losses was $16 million. Following the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 (see the "Restructuring Costs 27 and Other Charges" footnote) we have a $59 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $51 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Relationship with Host Marriott In recognition of the significant changes in the lodging industry over the last ten years and the age of our agreements with Host Marriott, many provisions of which predate our 1993 Spinoff, we and Host Marriott concluded that we could mutually enhance the long term strength and growth of both companies by updating our existing relationship. Accordingly, we are currently negotiating certain changes to our management agreements for Host Marriott owned hotels. The modifications under discussion would, if made, be effective as of the beginning of our 2002 fiscal year and would remain subject to the consent of various lenders to the properties and other third parties. If made, these changes would, among other things, . Provide Host Marriott with additional approval rights over budgets and capital expenditures; . Extend the effective management agreement termination dates for several hotels; . Expand the pool of hotels that Host Marriott could sell with franchise agreements to one of our approved franchisees and revise the method of determining the number of hotels that may be sold without a management agreement or franchise agreement; . Lower the incentive management fees payable to us by amounts dependent in part on underlying hotel profitability at eight hotels; . Reduce certain expenses to the properties and lower Host Marriotts working capital requirements; . Confirm that we and our affiliates may earn a profit (in addition to what we earn through management fees) on certain transactions relating to Host Marriott owned properties, and establish the specific conditions under which we may profit on future transactions; and . Terminate our existing right to purchase up to 20 percent of Host Marriotts outstanding common stock upon certain changes of control and clarify our rights in each of our management agreements to prevent either a sale of the hotel to our major competitors or specified changes in control of Host Marriott involving our major competitors. We cannot assure you that these negotiations will be successful, that the changes will be substantially as we have described above, or that the consents necessary to implement these changes will be obtained. The monetary effect of the anticipated changes will depend on future events such as the operating results of the hotels. We do not expect these modifications to have a material financial impact on us. 28 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives and through development and application of credit granting policies. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from December 29, 2000. Furthermore, we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how such exposure is managed in the near future. The following sensitivity analysis displays how changes in interest rates affect our earnings and the fair values of certain instruments we hold. We hold notes receivable that earn interest at variable rates. Hypothetically, an immediate 1 percentage point change in interest rates would change annual interest income by $5 million and $3 million, based on the respective balances of these notes receivable at December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt and long term fixed rate notes receivable. Based on the balances outstanding at December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000, a hypothetical immediate 1 percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt by $53 million and $50 million, respectively, and would change the fair value of long term fixed rate notes receivable by $22 million in each year. 29
