ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended January 3, 2003, December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000. Systemwide sales include sales from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Continuing Operations 2002 Compared to 2001 Income from continuing operations, net of taxes increased 63 percent to $439 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to $1.74. Income from continuing operations reflected $208 million of tax benefits associated with our Synthetic Fuel business and a $44 million gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International, offset by the $50 million charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay and the decreased demand for hotels and executive apartments. The comparisons to 2001 reflected the $204 million pretax restructuring and other charges against continuing operations that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Sales, which exclude sales from our discontinued Distribution Services and Senior Living Services businesses, increased 8 percent to $8.4 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales for our new Synthetic Fuel business and revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by the decline in lodging demand. Systemwide sales, excluding sales from discontinued businesses, increased by 6 percent to $18.6 billion in 2002. 2001 Compared to 2000 Income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 45 percent to $269 million and 46 percent to $1.05, respectively. Pretax restructuring and other charges totaling $204 million and lower lodging segment financial results, due to the decline in hotel performance, reduced income from continuing operations. Sales of $7.8 billion in 2001 from our continuing operations were down slightly compared to the prior year, reflecting a decline in hotel performance, partially offset by revenue from new lodging properties. Systemwide sales, excluding sales from our discontinued businesses were $17.5 billion, flat with the prior year. Marriott Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2002 2001 2000 2002/2001 2001/2000 Sales $ 8,248 $ 7,786 $ 7,911 6 % 2 % Segment financial results before restructuring costs, other charges, goodwill impairment and Interval International gain $ 713 $ 756 $ 936 6 % 19 % Restructuring costs (44 ) nm nm Other charges (71 ) nm nm Interval International gain 44 nm nm Goodwill impairment (50 ) nm nm Segment financial results, as reported $ 707 $ 641 $ 936 10 % 32 % 13 2002 Compared to 2001 Marriott Lodging, which includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported a 10 percent increase in segment financial results and 6 percent higher sales in 2002. Results reflect a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms. Our revenues from base fees totaled $379 million, an increase of 2 percent. Franchise fees totaled $232 million, an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were $162 million, a decline of 20 percent. The $50 million write down of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business, ExecuStay, reduced Lodging results in 2002. The 2002 comparisons are also impacted by the $115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded in 2001. 14 We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. Comparable REVPAR, room rate and occupancy statistics used throughout this report are based on North American properties we operate. Statistics for Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites company operated North American properties are not presented since these brands only have a few properties that we operate, the information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables below). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. Systemwide statistics are based on comparable worldwide units reflecting constant foreign exchange rates. Occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table.

Average room rates for these hotels decreased 4.9 percent and occupancy declined slightly to 70.1 percent. International Lodging reported an increase in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in Asia and the United Kingdom. The favorable comparison is also impacted by the restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Marriott Vacation Club International. Financial results increased 24 percent, reflecting a 5 percent increase in contract sales and note sale gains in 2002 of $60 million compared to $40 million in 2001, a gain of $44 million related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, partially offset by lower development profits and higher depreciation from recently added systems for customer support. Lodging Development Marriott Lodging opened 188 properties totaling over 31,000 rooms across its brands in 2002, while 25 hotels (approximately 4,700 rooms) exited the system. Highlights of the year included: Thirty five properties (6,700 rooms), 21 percent of our total room additions for the year, were conversions from other brands. Approximately 25 percent of new rooms opened were outside the United States. We added 112 properties (14,500 rooms) to our Select Service and Extended Stay Brands. The opening of new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in France (Disneyland Paris), Spain and a Ritz Carlton Club in Florida. At year end 2002, we had 300 hotel properties and more than 50,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development. We expect to open over 150 hotels and timesharing resorts (25,000 30,000 rooms) in 2003. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. See Forward Looking Statements above and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 2001 Compared to 2000 Marriott Lodging, which includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported a 32 percent decrease in segment financial results and 2 percent lower sales in 2001. Results reflected restructuring costs of $44 million and other charges of $71 million, including a $36 million reserve for third party guarantees we expect to fund and not recover out of future cash flow, $12 million of reserves for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible, a write off of two investments in management contracts and other assets of $8 million, $13 million of losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties, and a $2 million write off associated with capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform. Results also reflect lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms, partially offset by increased revenue associated with new properties. Incentive management fees declined 36 percent, base management fees declined 3 percent, and franchise fees increased 6 percent. 16 Occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table.

Average room rates for these hotels declined 2 percent, while occupancy declined 6.7 percentage points. International Lodging reported a decrease in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the decline in international travel and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by sales associated with new rooms. Over 35 percent of rooms added in 2001 were outside the United States. Marriott Vacation Club International contributed over 20 percent of lodging segment financial results in 2001, after the impact of restructuring and other charges. Segment financial results increased 7 percent reflecting a 17 22 percent increase in contract sales, the 2001 acquisition of the Grand Residence Club in Lake Tahoe, California, and note sale gains in 2001 of $40 million compared to $22 million in 2000, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and severance expenses of nearly $2 million associated with the Companys restructuring plan. Corporate Expenses, Interest and Taxes Corporate Expenses Annual Change ($ in millions) 2002 2001 2000 2002/2001 2001/2000 Corporate expenses before restructuring costs and other charges $ 126 $ 117 $ 120 8 % 3 % Restructuring costs 18 nm nm Other charges 22 nm nm Corporate expenses, as reported $ 126 $ 157 $ 120 20 % 31 % 2002 Compared to 2001 Corporate expenses decreased $31 million in 2002 to $126 million reflecting the following: (i) 2002 items, including higher insurance costs, higher litigation expenses, lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan, lower foreign exchange losses and the continued favorable impact of our cost containment initiatives; (ii) 2001 items, including restructuring charges of $18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs, a $35 million write off of three investments in technology partners (including a $22 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter), $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels. 2001 Compared to 2000 Corporate expenses increased $37 million reflecting the impact of restructuring charges of $18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs, and other charges related to the fourth quarter write off of a $22 million investment in one of our technology partners. In addition to these items, we also recorded $8 million of foreign exchange losses and in prior quarters we recorded a $13 million write off of two investments in technology partners. These charges were partially offset by $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing tax credit investments, the favorable impact of cost containment action plans, and the reversal of a long standing $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our managed hotels. The reversal of the insurance reserve was the result of our conclusion that a settlement could be reached in an amount that would be covered by insurance. We determined that it was no longer probable that the loss contingency would result in a material outlay by us and accordingly, we reversed the reserve during the first quarter of 2001. Interest Expense 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest expense decreased $23 million to $86 million reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates. 2001 Compared to 2000 Interest expense increased $9 million to $109 million reflecting the impact of the issuance of Series E Notes in January 2001 and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, partially offset by lower interest resulting from the payoff of commercial paper. Interest Income and Income Tax 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest income increased $28 million, before reflecting reserves of $12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels. The increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized which were previously 18 deemed uncollectible. The comparison to 2001 also reflects a $6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2002 from 36.1 percent in 2001 primarily due to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel business. Excluding the impact of Synthetic Fuel, our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2002 was 39.6 percent. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 35.4 percent to 15.7 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. 2001 Compared to 2000 Interest income increased $34 million, before reflecting reserves of $48 million for loans deemed uncollectible as a result of certain hotels experiencing significant declines in profitability and the owners not being able to meet debt service obligations. The change in interest income was impacted by income associated with higher loan balances, including the loans made to the Courtyard joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset by $6 million of expected guarantee fundings and the impact of $14 million of income recorded in 2000 associated with an international loan that was previously deemed uncollectible. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 36.1 percent in 2001 from 36.6 percent in 2000 as a result of modifications related to our deferred compensation plan and the impact of increased income in countries with lower effective tax rates. Synthetic Fuel In October 2001, we acquired four coal based synthetic fuel production facilities (the Facilities) for $46 million in cash. The Synthetic Fuel produced at the Facilities qualifies for tax credits based on Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Section 29, tax credits are not available for Synthetic Fuel produced after 2007. We began operating these Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. The operation of the Facilities, together with the benefit arising from the tax credits, has been, and we expect will continue to be significantly accretive to our net income. Although the Facilities produce significant losses, these are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section 29, which reduce our income tax expense. In the fiscal year 2002, our Synthetic Fuel business reflected sales of $193 million and a loss of $134 million, resulting in a tax benefit of $49 million and tax credits of $159 million. In January 2003, we entered into a contract with an unrelated third party to sell approximately a 50 percent interest in the Synthetic Fuel business. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the receipt of a satisfactory private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the new ownership structure. Contracts related to the potential sale are being held in escrow until closing conditions are met. If the conditions are not met by August 31, 2003, neither party will have an obligation to perform under the agreements. If the transaction is consummated, we expect to receive $25 million in promissory notes and cash as well as an earnout based on the amount of synthetic fuel produced. If the transaction is consummated, we expect to account for the remaining interest in the Synthetic Fuel business under the equity method of accounting. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services 2002 Compared to 2001 On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc. and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL Retirement Partners, Inc. (CNL) for approximately $259 million in cash. We expect to complete the sale early in 2003. On December 17, 2002, we sold twelve senior living communities to CNL for approximately $89 million in cash. We accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 66, and we recorded an after tax loss of approximately $13 million. Also, on December 30, 2002, we purchased 14 senior living communities for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt, from an unrelated owner. We had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. We plan to restructure the debt and sell the communities in 2003. Management has approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. Accordingly, at January 3, 2003, the operating results of our Senior Living Services 19 segment are reported in discontinued operations, and the remaining assets are classified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet. As a result of the transactions outlined above, we anticipate a total after tax charge of $109 million. Since generally accepted accounting principles do not allow gains to be recognized until the underlying transaction closes, we cannot record the estimated after tax gain of $22 million on the sale of the nine communities to CNL until the sale is completed, which we expect to occur in early 2003. As a result, we have recorded an after tax charge of $131 million which is included in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. In December 2001, management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months. We recorded an impairment charge of $60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value at December 28, 2001. On October 1, 2002, we completed the sale of these properties for $62 million which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by $11 million. We included the $11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes and excluding the loss on disposal of $131 million, was $23 million, an increase of $52 million over 2001 results. The increase reflects the impact of the 2001 plan to exit the companion living concept and its subsequent execution, higher per diems, recognition of a $2 million one time pretax payment associated with the sale of the Crestline Senior Living communities to an unaffiliated third party, lower amortization associated with our adoption of FAS No. 142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of 2002 and lower depreciation, partially offset by higher insurance costs. 2001 Compared to 2000 Marriott Senior Living Services posted a 9 percent increase in sales in 2001, as we added a net total of three new communities (369 units) during the year. Occupancy for comparable communities increased by nearly 2 percent to 85.3 percent in 2001. The division reported an after tax loss of $45 million, reflecting pretax restructuring and other charges of $62 million, primarily related to the $60 million write down of 25 senior living communities held for sale to their estimated fair value and the write off of a $2 million (pretax) receivable no longer deemed collectible. These charges were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in comparable occupancy and the new units. Distribution Services 2002 Compared to 2001 In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of the distribution services business and decided to exit the business. As of January 3, 2003, through a combination of sale and transfer of nine facilities and the termination of all operations at four facilities, we have exited the distribution services business. Accordingly, we present the operating results of our distribution services business as discontinued operations and classify the remaining assets as held for sale at January 3, 2003 on the balance sheet. The after tax cost to exit the business was $40 million and included payments to third parties in connection with contractual agreements, severance costs and adjusting fixed assets to net realizable value. We present the exit costs together with the loss on operations of $14 million, net of taxes in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. The $14 million after tax loss in 2002 represents a decline of $10 million from 2001 results. The decrease reflects the impact of lower sales and a pretax $2 million write off in the first quarter of 2002 of an investment in a customer contract, offset by the 2001 restructuring and other charges of $5 million (pretax) for severance costs and the write off of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy. 2001 Compared to 2000 Financial results for Marriott Distribution Services (MDS) reflect the impact of an increase in sales related to the commencement of new contracts in 2001 and increased sales from contracts established in 2000. The impact of higher sales on the financial results was more than offset by the decline in business from one significant customer, transportation inefficiencies and restructuring and other charges of $5 million (pretax), including severance costs and the write off of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2001. 20 2001 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The Company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy. This decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In 2001, we responded by implementing certain companywide cost saving measures, although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations. As a result of our restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded pretax restructuring costs of $62 million, including (1) $15 million in severance costs; (2) $19 million, primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $28 million related to the write off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We also incurred $142 million of other charges including (1) $85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses; (2) $12 million related to accounts receivable reserves; (3) $13 million related to the write down of properties held for sale; and (4) $32 million related to the impairment of technology related investments and other write offs. We have provided below detailed information related to the restructuring costs and other charges, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the economic downturn and the unfavorable lodging environment. 2001 Restructuring Costs Severance Our restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of approximately 1,700 employees across our operations (the majority of which were terminated by December 28, 2001). In 2001, we recorded a workforce reduction charge of $15 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits. The charge did not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property level severance costs. In addition, we delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours. Facilities Exit Costs As a result of the workforce reduction and delay in filling vacant positions, we consolidated excess corporate facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $14 million for excess corporate facilities, primarily related to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In addition, we recorded a $5 million charge for lease terminations resulting from cancellations of leased units by our corporate apartment business, primarily in downtown New York City. Development Cancellations and Elimination of Product Line We incur certain costs associated with the development of properties, including legal costs, the cost of land and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the dramatic downturn in the economy in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, we decided to cancel development projects that were no longer deemed viable. As a result, in 2001, we expensed $28 million of previously capitalized costs. 2001 Other Charges Reserves for Guarantees and Loan Losses We issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of the downturn in the economy, certain hotels experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners were not able to meet debt service obligations to the Company or in some cases, to other third party lending institutions. As a result, in 2001, based upon cash flow projections, we expected to fund under certain guarantees, which were not deemed recoverable, and we expected that several of the loans made by us would not be repaid according to their original terms. Due to these expected non recoverable guarantee fundings and expected loan losses, we recorded charges of $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. 21 Accounts Receivable Bad Debts In the fourth quarter of 2001, we reserved $12 million of accounts receivable which we deemed uncollectible following an analysis of these accounts, generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment. Asset Impairments We recorded a charge related to the impairment of an investment in a technology related joint venture ($22 million), losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties ($13 million), write offs of investments in management contracts and other assets ($8 million), and the write off of capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform ($2 million). The following table summarizes our remaining restructuring liability ($ in millions): Restructuring costs and other charges liability at December 28, 2001 Cash payments made in fiscal 2002 Charges reversed in fiscal 2002 Restructuring costs and other charges liability at January 3, 2003 Severance $ 6 $ 4 $ $ 2 Facilities exit costs 17 4 2 11 Total restructuring costs 23 8 2 13 Reserves for guarantees and loan losses 33 10 2 21 Impairment of technology related investments and other 1 1 Total $ 57 $ 19 $ 4 $ 34 The remaining liability related to the workforce reduction and fundings under guarantees will be substantially paid by January 2004. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012.

The restructuring liability related to discontinued operations was $3 million as of December 28, 2001 and $1 million as of January 3, 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have credit facilities which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At January 3, 2003, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to nearly $2 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements, including the repayment of $200 million of senior notes due in November 2003. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper, and may have to rely more on bank borrowings which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. We have presented a claim with an insurance company for lost management fees from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. At this stage of the claims process, we have recognized $1 million in income from insurance proceeds. Although we expect to realize further proceeds we cannot currently estimate the amounts that may be paid to us. Cash from Operations Cash from operations was $516 million in 2002, $403 million in 2001, and $856 million in 2000. Income from continuing operations is stated after depreciation expense of $114 million in 2002, $110 million in 2001, and $94 million in 2000, and after amortization expense of $36 million in 2002, $68 million in 2001, and $67 million in 2000. While our timesharing business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts, and cash received from purchaser financing affect annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. In 2002, the $63 million net cash outflow from timeshare activity included $102 million in timeshare development (the amount spent to build timeshare resorts less the costs of sales), $280 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections, $60 million of note sale gains, a $16 million net reduction in Marriott Rewards accruals, $13 million of financially reportable sales in excess of closed sales, and $10 million of other cash outflows, offset by $387 million of note sale proceeds and $31 million of net fees received for servicing notes. In 2001, the $358 million net cash outflow from timeshare activity included $253 million in timeshare development, $320 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections, $40 million of note sale gains and $27 million in capitalized marketing costs, offset by $199 million of note sale proceeds, $26 million of net fees received for servicing notes, $53 million of closed sales in excess of financially reportable sales and $4 million of other cash inflows. In 2000, the $195 million cash outflow from timeshare activity included $112 million in timeshare development, $210 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections, $23 million of note sale gains, $25 million in capitalized marketing costs, $18 million of financially reportable sales in excess of closed sales and $3 million of other cash outflows, offset by $154 million of note sale proceeds, $17 million of net fees received for servicing notes and $25 million net increase in Marriott Rewards accruals. 23 In 2002, other cash flows from operating activities of $223 million included an adjustment for $186 million related to the exit of our Senior Living Services and Distribution Services businesses, and an adjustment for $50 million related to the impairment of goodwill of our ExecuStay brand. In 2001, other cash flows from operating activities of $278 million included an adjustment for $248 million, related to non cash restructuring and other charges, necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operations. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (from continuing operations) was $707 million in 2002, $708 million in 2001, and $1,032 million in 2000. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel business, EBITDA would have increased by $125 million, or 18 percent to $833 million. The reconciliation of income from continuing operations, before income taxes to EBITDA is as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Income from continuing operations, before taxes $ 471 $ 421 $ 771 Interest expense 86 109 100 Depreciation 114 110 94 Amortization 36 68 67 EBITDA from continuing operations $ 707 $ 708 $ 1,032 Synthetic Fuel loss, before taxes 134 Depreciation Synthetic Fuel (8 ) EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding Synthetic Fuel $ 833 $ 708 $ 1,032 We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. Nevertheless, you should not consider EBITDA an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A substantial portion of our EBITDA is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. These include lodging base management fees, franchise fees and land rent. With almost 2,600 hotels in the Marriott system, no single property or region is critical to our financial results. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.8 to 1 at January 3, 2003, compared to 1.4 to 1 at December 28, 2001. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. Additionally, we have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreements. In 2002 we securitized $387 million of notes by selling notes receivable originated by our timeshare business. We recognized gains on these sales of $60 million in the year ended January 3, 2003. Our ability to continue to sell notes to such off balance sheet entities depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the entities buying the notes. Also, our ability to continue to consummate such securitizations would be impacted if the underlying quality of the notes receivable originated by us were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. In connection with these securitization transactions, at January 3, 2003, we had repurchase obligations of $12 million related to previously sold notes receivable, although we expect to incur no material losses in respect of those obligations. We retain interests in the securitizations which are accounted for as interest only strips, and in the year ended January 3, 2003, we received cash flows of $28 million arising from those retained interests. At January 3, 2003, the qualifying special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of $682 million. Investing Activities Cash Flows Acquisitions. We continually seek opportunities to enter new markets, increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions. 24 Dispositions. Property sales generated proceeds of $729 million in 2002, $554 million in 2001 and $742 million in 2000. Proceeds in 2002 are net of $36 million of financing and joint venture investments made by us in connection with the sales transactions. In 2002 we closed on the sales of 10 hotels and 41 senior living communities, over half of which we continue to operate under long term operating agreements. Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $292 million in 2002, $560 million in 2001, and $1,095 million in 2000 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties. Over time, we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development, or to be developed, while continuing to operate them under long term agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry, and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans, minority equity investments and development of new timeshare resorts. In 2002, other investing activities outflows of $7 million included equity investments of $26 million, an investment in corporate owned life insurance of $11 million and other net cash outflows of $33 million, offset by cash proceeds of $63 million from the sale of our investment in Interval International. In 2001, other investing outflows of $179 million included equity investments of $33 million, an investment in corporate owned life insurance of $97 million and other net cash outflows of $131 million, partially offset by the sale of the affordable housing tax credit investments of $82 million. In 2000, other investing outflows of $377 million included equity investments of $170 million, an investment in corporate owned life insurance of $14 million and other net cash outflows of $193 million. On February 23, 2000, we entered into an agreement to resolve litigation involving certain limited partnerships formed in the mid to late 1980s. Under the agreement, we paid $31 million to partners in four limited partnerships and acquired, through an unconsolidated joint venture (the Courtyard Joint Venture) with affiliates of Host Marriott Corporation (Host Marriott), substantially all of the limited partners interests in two other limited partnerships, Courtyard by Marriott Limited Partnership (CBM I) and Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership (CBM II). These partnerships own 120 Courtyard by Marriott hotels. The Courtyard Joint Venture was financed with equity contributed in equal shares by us and affiliates of Host Marriott and approximately $200 million in mezzanine debt provided by us. Our total investment in the joint venture, including mezzanine debt, is approximately $300 million. In early 2000, the Company estimated the amount of the planned investment in the Courtyard Joint Venture based upon (1) estimated post acquisition cash flows, including anticipated changes in the related hotel management agreements to be made contemporaneously with the investment; (2) the investees new capital structure; and (3) estimates of prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates reflected in the market at that time. The investment in the Courtyard Joint Venture was consummated late in the fourth quarter of 2000. For purposes of purchase accounting, the Courtyard Joint Venture valued its investment in the partnership units based on (1) pre acquisition cash flows; (2) the pre acquisition capital structure; and (3) prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates in December 2000. Due to a number of factors, the equity values used in the purchase accounting for the Courtyard Joint Ventures investment were different than limited partner unit estimates included in the CBM I and CBM II Purchase Offer and Consent Solicitations (the Solicitations). At a 20 percent discount rate, the combined CBM I and CBM II estimates reflected in the Solicitations totaled $254 million. In the purchase accounting, the corresponding equity value in the Courtyard Joint Venture totaled $372 million. The principal differences between these two amounts are attributed to the following: (1) the investment was consummated almost one year subsequent to the time the original estimates were prepared ($30 million); and (2) a lower discount rate (17 percent) and capitalization rate reflecting changes in market conditions versus the date at which the estimates in the solicitations were prepared ($79 million). The Company assessed its potential investment and any potential loss on settlement based on post acquisition cash flows. The purchase accounting was based on pre acquisition cash flows and capital structure. As a result, the factors giving rise to the differences outlined above did not materially impact the Companys previous assessment of any expense related to litigation. The post settlement equity of the Joint Venture is considerably lower then the pre acquisition equity due to additional indebtedness post acquisition and the impact of changes to the management agreements made contemporaneously with the transaction. 25 Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging businesses because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel sales values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. We have made loans to owners of hotels and senior living communities that we operate or franchise. Loans outstanding under this program, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $944 million at January 3, 2003, $860 million at December 28, 2001 and $592 million at December 29, 2000. Unfunded commitments aggregating $217 million were outstanding at January 3, 2003, of which we expect to fund $140 million in 2003 and $156 million in total. We participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third party ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise. Cash from Financing Activities Debt, including convertible debt, decreased $945 million in 2002 due to the redemption of 85 percent of the LYONs in May 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility, offset by the debt assumed as part of the acquisition of the 14 senior living communities in December 2002. Debt increased by $799 million in 2001 primarily due to borrowings to finance our capital expenditure and share repurchase programs, and to maintain excess cash reserves totaling $645 million in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2002, our long term debt, excluding convertible debt and debt associated with businesses held for sale, had an average interest rate of 6.8 percent and an average maturity of approximately 6.6 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was .91 as of January 3, 2003. In April 1999, January 2000 and January 2001, we filed universal shelf registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the amounts of $500 million, $300 million and $300 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2003, we had offered and sold to the public under these registration statements $300 million of debt securities at 77/8 percent, due 2009 and $300 million at 81/8 percent, due 2005, leaving a balance of $500 million available for future offerings. In January 2001, we issued, through a private placement, $300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008, and received net proceeds of $297 million. We completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on January 15, 2002. We are a party to revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of $1.5 billion expiring in July 2006, and $500 million expiring in February 2004, which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At January 3, 2003, loans of approximately $21 million were outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. On May 8, 2001, we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021, also known as LYONs, and received cash proceeds of $405 million. On May 9, 2002, we redeemed for cash the approximately 85 percent of the LYONs that were tendered for mandatory repurchase by the holders. The remaining LYONs are convertible into approximately 0.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and carry a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent. We may not redeem the LYONs prior to May 2004. We may at the option of the holders be required to purchase LYONs at their accreted value on May 8 of each of 2004, 2011 and 2016. We may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash and or shares of our Class A Common Stock. We determine our debt capacity based on the amount and variability of our cash flows. EBITDA (from continuing operations) coverage of gross interest cost was 5.5 times in 2002, and we met the cash flow requirements under our loan agreements. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel business, EBITDA coverage of gross interest would have been 6.5 times. At January 3, 2003, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys, respectively. 26 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years ($ in millions) Debt $ 1,734 $ 242 $ 550 $ 121 $ 821 Operating Leases Recourse 971 107 174 121 569 Non recourse 548 17 69 96 366 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 3,253 $ 366 $ 793 $ 338 $ 1,756 The totals above exclude recourse minimum lease payments of $341 million associated with the discontinued Senior Living and Distribution Services businesses, due as follows: less than 1 year $40 million; 1 3 years $68 million; 4 5 years $63 million; and after 5 years $170 million. Also excluded are non recourse minimum lease payments of $82 million associated with the discontinued Senior Living Services business, due as follows: less than 1 year $2 million; 1 3 years $12 million; 4 5 years $13 million; and after 5 years $55 million. Excluded from the debt obligation is $155 million associated with the discontinued Senior Living Services business. The following table summarizes our commitments: Total Amounts Committed Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years ($ in millions) Guarantees $ 827 $ 77 $ 100 $ 264 $ 386 Timeshare note repurchase obligations 12 2 10 Total $ 839 $ 77 $ 102 $ 264 $ 396 Our guarantees include $270 million for commitments which will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $217 million at January 3, 2003. We expect to fund $140 million within one year and $16 million in one to three years. We do not expect to fund the remaining $61 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $51 million within one year; $5 million in one to three years; $2 million in four to five years; and $3 million after five years. Share Repurchases. We purchased 7.8 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of $32.52 per share and 6.1 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of $38.20 per share. As of February 6, 2003, we had been authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase 20 million shares. Dividends. In May 2002, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8 percent to $.07 per share. Other Matters Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years, and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Critical Accounting Policies Certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters. Our accounting policies are in compliance with principles generally accepted in the United States, although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact. We have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. 27 Incentive Fees We recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract. In interim periods, we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. If we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying full year performance thresholds were certain, the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged, but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter. We recognized incentive fee revenue of $162 million, $202 million and $316 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cost Reimbursements For domestic properties that we manage, we are responsible to employees for salaries and wages and to subcontractors and other creditors for materials and services. We also have the discretionary responsibility to procure and manage the resources in performing our services under these contracts. We therefore include these costs and the reimbursement of the costs as part of our expenses and revenues. We recorded cost reimbursements (excluding senior living services) of $5.7 billion in 2002 and $5.2 billion in 2001 and $5.3 billion in 2000. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with FAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $51 million in 2002, $16 million in 2001 and $18 million in 2000. Our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under FAS No. 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules. Timeshare Sales We also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with FAS No. 66. We recognize sales when we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval, the period of cancellation with refund has expired, receivables are deemed collectible and certain minimum sales and construction levels have been attained. For sales that do not meet these criteria, we defer all revenue using the deposit method. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until the sales are recognized. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. Selling and marketing costs capitalized under this approach were approximately $107 million and $126 million at January 3, 2003, and December 28, 2001, respectively, and are included in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a contract is canceled, unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs are charged to expense and deposits forfeited are recorded as income. Interest Only Strips We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our timeshare business in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals. We retain servicing assets and interests in the assets transferred to special purpose entities that are accounted for as interest only strips. The interest only strips are treated as Trading or Available for Sale securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We report changes in the fair values of the interest only strips through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for available for sale securities. We had interest only strips of $135 million at January 3, 2003 and $87 million at December 28, 2001, which are recorded as long term receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific 28 impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At January 3, 2003, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $129 million. We have a $59 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $70 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, and communicating with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed. Avendra In January 2001, Marriott and Hyatt Corporation formed a joint venture, Avendra LLC (Avendra), to be an independent professional procurement services company serving the North American hospitality market and related industries. Six Continents Hotels, Inc., ClubCorp USA Inc., and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, Inc., joined Avendra in March 2001. We and the other four members contributed our respective procurement businesses to Avendra. Currently, our interest in Avendra is slightly less than 50 percent. Avendra generally does not purchase and resell goods and services; instead, its customers purchase goods and services directly from Avendras vendors on terms negotiated by Avendra. Avendra earns revenue through agreements with its vendors which provide that the vendors pay Avendra an unrestricted allowance for purchases by its customers. Our hotel management agreements treat vendor generated unrestricted allowances in three separate ways, and the requirements of those agreements are reflected in our Procurement Services Agreement with Avendra (PSA). For purchases of goods and services by the majority of Marriotts managed hotels, Avendra is permitted to retain unrestricted allowances, in an amount sufficient only to recover Avendras properly allocated costs of providing procurement services. Other management contracts allow Avendra to retain vendor allowances and earn a return which is competitive in the industry. This amount is capped by the PSA. Lastly, for purchases of goods and services by hotels owned by one of Marriotts hotel owners, Avendra is not permitted to retain any of such unrestricted allowances; instead, Avendra charges a negotiated fee to Marriott, and Marriott in turn charges a negotiated fee to that owner. In 2002, we distributed to the hotels that we manage approximately $12 million in unrestricted rebates received from Avendra, and its predecessor, Marketplace by Marriott. If Marriott franchised hotels (not managed by Marriott) elect to purchase through Avendra, they negotiate separately with Avendra and are not bound by the terms of the PSA for our managed hotels. We account for our interest in Avendra under the equity method and recognized income of $2 million in 2002 and a loss of $1 million in 2001. After we have recovered our investment in Avendra and associated expenses through distributions from Avendra or a sale of all or any portion of our equity interest in Avendra, we will apply any further benefits to offset costs otherwise allocable to Marriott branded hotels. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives and through development and application of credit granting policies. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from December 28, 2001. Furthermore, we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how such exposure is managed in the near future. The following sensitivity analysis displays how changes in interest rates affect our earnings and the fair values of certain instruments we hold. We hold notes receivable that earn interest at variable rates. Hypothetically, an immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change annual interest income by $5 million and $5 million, based on the respective balances of these notes receivable at January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt and long term fixed rate notes receivable. Based on the balances outstanding at January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001, a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt by $42 million and $53 million, respectively, and would change the fair value of long term fixed rate notes receivable by $20 million and $22 million, respectively, in each year. Although commercial paper is classified as long term debt (based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis) all commercial paper matures within two months of year end. Based on the balance of commercial paper outstanding at January 3, 2003, a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would change interest expense by $1 million on an annualized basis. 30
