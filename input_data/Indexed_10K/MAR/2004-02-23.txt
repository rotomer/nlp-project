Rooms revenue contributed the majority of Marriott Hotels & Resorts revenues for fiscal year 2003, with the remainder coming from food and beverage operations, recreational facilities and other services. Overall hotel system profits are usually relatively stable and include only moderate seasonal fluctuations. Business at resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.

In 2003, most Courtyard hotels introduced free in room high speed internet and in 2004, this will be a standard feature along with The Market (a self serve food store open 24 hours a day). The operating systems developed for these hotels allow Courtyard to be price competitive while providing better value through superior facilities and guest service.

In 2003, consistent with our plan to shift the business toward franchising, the total number of units leased by ExecuStay decreased and 10 franchise markets were added. At January 2, 2004, Marriott ExecuStays franchise program, launched in July 2002, included eight franchisees covering 11 U.S. markets. Marriott Executive Apartments and other.

All Marriott Executive Apartments are located outside the United States. Timeshare Marriott Vacation Club International develops, sells and operates vacation timesharing resorts under four brands. Revenues are generated from three primary sources: (1) selling fee simple and other forms of timeshare intervals, (2) financing consumer purchases of timesharing intervals, and (3) operating the resorts. Many timesharing resorts are located adjacent to Marriott hotels, and timeshare owners have access to certain hotel facilities during their vacation. Owners can trade their annual interval for intervals at other Marriott timesharing resorts or for intervals at certain timesharing resorts not otherwise sponsored by Marriott through a third party exchange company. Owners can also trade their unused interval for points in the Marriott Rewards frequent stay program, enabling them to stay at over 2,400 Marriott hotels worldwide. Marriott Vacation Club International (MVCI) brand offers full service villas featuring living and dining areas, one, two and three bedroom options, full kitchen and washer/dryer. In 41 locations worldwide this brand draws U.S. and international customers who vacation regularly with a focus on family, relaxation, and recreational activities. In the U.S., MVCI is located in beach and golf communities in California, Hawaii, the Carolinas and Florida and in ski resorts in Colorado, California and Utah. MVCI has a growing international presence with resorts in Thailand, France and Spain. The Ritz Carlton Club brand is a luxury tier real estate fractional brand that combines the benefits of second home ownership with personalized services and amenities. This brand is designed as a private club whose members have access to all Ritz Carlton Clubs. This brand is offered in ski, golf and beach destinations in Colorado, St. Thomas, U.S.V.I., and Florida. Marriott Grand Residence Club is an upper quality tier fractional ownership brand for corporate and leisure customers. This new brand is currently offering ownership in projects located in Lake Tahoe, California and London. 11 Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International is Marriott Vacation Clubs moderately priced timeshare brand whose product offerings and customer base are currently focused on facilitating family vacations in entertainment communities. Today, Horizons resorts are located in Orlando and Branson, Missouri. We expect that our future timeshare growth will increasingly reflect opportunities presented by partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures. In 2003 MVCI entered into a joint venture with a third party builder to build a new project in Las Vegas. We also entered into a sales and marketing agreement in connection with an existing non Marriott project. Marriott Vacation Club International opened six resorts in 2003: four under the MVCI brand (KoOlina and Waiohai in Hawaii, Playa Andaluza in Spain, and Village dIle de France outside of Paris) together with The Ritz Carlton Club in Jupiter, Florida and the Grand Residence Club in London. Our project in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina opened for sales in 2003, and we expect that the resort will open in June 2004. MVCI continues to offer timeshare intervals in its moderate tier brand, Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International. Marriott Vacation Club Internationals owner base continues to expand, with 256,000 owners at year end 2003, compared to 223,000 in 2002. Timeshare (all brands) Geographic Distribution at January 2, 2004 Resorts Units Continental United States 36 6,255 Hawaii 4 747 Caribbean 3 608 Europe 5 696 Asia 1 54 Total 49 8,360 Other Activities Marriott Golf manages 23 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners. We operate 19 systemwide hotel reservation centers, 13 of them in the United States and Canada and six in other countries and territories, that handle reservation requests for Marriott lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own one of the U.S. facilities and lease the others. Our Architecture and Construction (A&C) division provides design, development, construction, refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from their management or franchise contracts. Consistent with third party contractors, A&C provides these services for owners and franchisees of Marriott branded properties on a fee basis. Competition We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. There are approximately 600 lodging management companies in the United States, including several that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands. Management contracts are typically long term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met. Affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the U.S. lodging industry. In 2003, approximately two thirds of U.S. hotel rooms were brand affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. The franchising business is fairly concentrated, with the three largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all U.S. rooms. Outside the United States branding is much less prevalent, and most markets are served primarily by independent operators. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers are reduced, international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs. Based on lodging industry data, we have an 8 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms), and less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the United States. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically 12 generate higher occupancies and Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) than direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference. Approximately 34 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands. Properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Our management, lease, and franchise agreements provide for the allocation of funds, generally a fixed percentage of revenue, for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings. We believe that these ongoing refurbishment programs are adequate to preserve the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties. We also strive to update and improve the products and services we offer. We believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands, we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising. The vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies. Since entering the timeshare industry in 1984, we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide. Competition in the timeshare business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts, the pricing of timeshare intervals and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs. We believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences, combined with our financial strength, diverse market presence, strong brands and well maintained properties, will enable us to remain competitive. Marriott Rewards is a frequent guest program with nearly 20 million members and nine participating Marriott brands. The Marriott Rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 24 participating airline programs. We believe that Marriott Rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In addition, the ability of Marriott Vacation Club International timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into Marriott Rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand. Synthetic Fuel Our synthetic fuel operation consists of our minority ownership interest in four coal based synthetic fuel production facilities, two of which are located at a coal mine in Saline County, Illinois and the remaining two are located at a coal mine in Jefferson County, Alabama. The operation creates a fuel that qualifies for tax credits pursuant to Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. This tax credit program expires on December 31, 2007. We held all of the ownership in the synthetic fuel business prior to June 21, 2003, when we completed a previously announced sale of an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the operation. At both of the locations, the synthetic fuel operation has entered into long term site leases at sites that are adjacent to large underground mines as well as barge load out facilities on navigable rivers. In addition, the synthetic fuel operation has entered into long term fixed price coal purchase agreements with the owners of the adjacent coal mines and long term fixed price synthetic fuel sales contracts with the Tennessee Valley Authority and with Alabama Power Company, two major utilities. These contracts ensure that the operation has long term agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel, covering approximately 80 percent of the productive capacity of the facilities. From time to time, the synthetic fuel operation supplements these base contracts, as opportunities arise, by entering into short term spot contracts to buy coal from other coal mines and sell synthetic fuel to these or different end users. The operation is slightly seasonal as the synthetic fuel is mainly burned to produce electricity and electricity use peaks in the Summer in the markets served by the synthetic fuel operation. In addition, the synthetic fuel operation has entered into a long term operations and maintenance agreement with an experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities. This manager is responsible for staffing the facilities, operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation. Finally, the synthetic fuel operation has entered into a long term license and binder supply agreement with Headwaters Incorporated, which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by Headwaters and manufactured by Dow Chemical to facilitate converting the coal into a qualified synthetic fuel. On November 7, 2003, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued private letter rulings to the synthetic fuel joint venture confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the facilities is a qualified fuel under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the Synthetic Fuel joint venture. Discontinued Operations Marriott Senior Living Services On December 17, 2002, we sold 12 senior living communities to CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (CNL) for approximately $89 million in cash. We accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 66, and we recorded an after tax loss of approximately $13 million. On December 30, 2002, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our senior living management 13 business to Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (Sunrise) and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL. We completed these sales to Sunrise and CNL in addition to the related sale of a parcel of land to Sunrise on March 28, 2003, for $266 million and recognized a gain, net of taxes, of $23 million. Also, on December 30, 2002, we purchased 14 senior living communities for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt, from an unrelated owner. We had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. Management approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. As part of that plan, on March 31, 2003, we acquired all of the subordinated credit enhanced mortgage securities relating to the 14 communities in a transaction in which we issued $46 million of unsecured Marriott International, Inc. notes, due April 2004. In the 2003 third quarter, we sold the 14 communities to CNL for approximately $184 million. We provided a $92 million acquisition loan to CNL in connection with the sale. Sunrise currently operates and will continue to operate the 14 communities under long term management agreements. We accounted for the sale in accordance with FAS No. 66 and recorded a gain, net of taxes, of $1 million. For the year ended January 3, 2003, we recorded an after tax charge of $131 million associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business. As a result of the above transactions we now report this business in discontinued operations. Marriott Distribution Services Prior to its discontinuance, Marriott Distribution Services (MDS) was a United States limited line distributor of food and related supplies to Marriott businesses and unrelated third parties. In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a strategic review of the Distribution Services business and decided to exit the business. As of January 3, 2003, through a combination of sale and transfer of nine facilities and the termination of all operations at four facilities, we completed our exit of the Distribution Services business. Accordingly, we now report this business in discontinued operations. Employee Relations At January 2, 2004, we had approximately 128,000 employees. Approximately 7,100 employees were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive. Other Properties In addition to the operating properties discussed above, we lease five office buildings with combined space of approximately 1,140,000 square feet in Bethesda, Maryland, Chevy Chase, Maryland and Orlando, Florida where our corporate, Ritz Carlton and Marriott Vacation Club International headquarters are located, respectively. We believe our properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Current Proceedings The CTF/HPI arbitration and litigation and the Strategic Hotel litigation are described under the caption heading Litigation and Arbitration in Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report and are hereby incorporated by reference. We believe that the claims made against us in each of those proceedings are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against them. However, we cannot assure you as to the outcome of these lawsuits, nor can we currently estimate the range of potential losses to the Company. From time to time we are also subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We currently are not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Recently Terminated Proceedings Senior Housing and Five Star litigation. The Company and Marriott Senior Living Services, Inc. (SLS) (which on March 28, 2003, became a subsidiary of Sunrise Senior Living) were parties to actions in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland and the Superior Court for Middlesex County, Massachusetts both initiated on November 27, 2002 (the Massachusetts court subsequently dismissed the Massachusetts action on March 4, 2003). These actions related to 31 senior living communities that SLS operates for Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) and Five Star Quality Care, Inc. (FVE), and SNH/FVEs attempt to terminate the operating agreements for these communities. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the parties entered into settlement discussions and on January 7, 2004, the parties settled the suit on terms not material to us. The parties expect to receive formal notice of dismissal from the Maryland court in the near future. Whitehouse Hotel litigation. On April 7, 2003, Whitehouse Hotel Limited Partnership and WH Holdings, L.L.C., the owners of the New Orleans Ritz Carlton Hotel, filed suit against us and The Ritz Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. (Ritz Carlton) in the Civil District Court for the Parish of New Orleans, Louisiana. On October 24, 2003 the parties settled the suit on terms not material to us and on November 3, 2003 the suit was dismissed with prejudice upon joint motion of the parties. Shareholders Derivative Actions (also recently resolved) On January 16, 2003, Daniel and Raizel Taubenfeld filed a shareholders derivative action in Delaware Chancery Court against each member of our Board of Directors and against Avendra LLC. The company was named as a nominal defendant. The individual defendants were accused of exposing the company to accusations and lawsuits which allege wrongdoing on the part of the company. The complaint alleged that, as a result, the companys reputation had been damaged leading to business losses and the compelled renegotiation of some management contracts. The substantive allegations of the complaint were derived exclusively from prior press reports. The plaintiffs made no damage claim against us, nor did they assert any specific damage amount against the individual defendants. Both the directors and the Company moved to dismiss this action. The court granted that motion on October 28, 2003, dismissing the complaint with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only. On July 2, 2003, the Taubenfelds also initiated an action in Delaware Chancery Court pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, to obtain access to certain of the Companys books and records, which remains outstanding. Amalgamated Bank brought a similar shareholder action for access to books and records under Section 220 in Delaware Chancery Court on July 8, 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into separate settlement agreements with the Taubenfelds and with Amalgamated Bank pursuant to which we will produce a limited number of documents. Once confidentiality agreements are entered into, these two proceedings will also be dismissed. 15 ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS None. 16 Part II ITEM 5.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,718 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments, Full Service Lodging, Select Service Lodging, Extended Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 14 separate brand names in 68 countries. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business: (1) selling timeshare intervals, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our Synthetic Fuel joint venture. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. This historically challenging time in the lodging industry has demonstrated Marriott Internationals resilience, the strength of our business model, superior brands, strong management team and dedicated associates. We are optimistic about a stronger business climate in 2004. And with the final disposition of our senior living and distribution services businesses in 2003, we look forward to operating as a focused lodging and timeshare company for the first time in our 76 year history. In 2003, we grew productivity at the hotel level leveraging our buying power and systems. Greater integration of sophisticated scheduling systems reduced hours worked per occupied room by over 10 percent in 2003 over 2000 levels for participating hotels. In addition, food and supply costs were reduced due to greater participation in our centralized procurement and accounts payable systems. By pooling risk among our managed hotel portfolio, we continued to purchase insurance at a lower cost than any property could purchase alone. By the end of 2003, we had high speed internet access available in approximately 1,400 hotels, far outpacing our competition. We also introduced wireless internet access in lobbies, meeting rooms and public spaces in over 900 hotels in the U.S. during the year. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended January 2, 2004, January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. Continuing Operations Revenues ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Full Service $ 5,876 $ 5,508 $ 5,260 Select Service 1,000 967 864 Extended Stay 557 600 635 Timeshare 1,279 1,147 1,009 Total lodging 8,712 8,222 7,768 Synthetic fuel 302 193 $ 9,014 $ 8,415 $ 7,768 19 Income from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Full Service $ 407 $ 397 $ 294 Select Service 99 130 145 Extended Stay 47 (3 ) 55 Timeshare 149 183 147 Total lodging financial results (pretax) 702 707 641 Synthetic fuel (after tax) 96 74 Unallocated corporate expenses (132 ) (126 ) (157 ) Interest income, provision for loan losses and interest expense 12 24 (63 ) Income taxes (excluding Synthetic fuel) (202 ) (240 ) (152 ) $ 476 $ 439 $ 269 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenues from continuing operations increased 7 percent to $9 billion in 2003 reflecting revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94. Synthetic Fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002. Our lodging financial results declined $5 million, to $702 million in 2003. The comparisons from 2002 benefit from the $50 million pretax charge to write down acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay in 2002, offset by the $44 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International in 2002, and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. 2002 Compared to 2001 Revenues from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $8.4 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales of our new Synthetic Fuel operation and revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by a slowdown in the economy and the resulting decline in lodging demand. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 63 percent to $439 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to $1.74. Income from continuing operations reflected $74 million associated with our synthetic fuel operation, the results also reflected a $44 million pretax 2002 gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International, offset by the $50 million pretax 2002 charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay and the decreased 2002 demand for hotel rooms and executive apartments. The comparisons to 2001 include the impact of the $204 million pretax restructuring and other charges that we recorded against continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating Income 2003 Compared to 2002 Operating income increased 17 percent to $377 million in 2003. The favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the $50 million write down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our ExecuStay business, the 2003 receipt of $36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our Synthetic Fuel operation. In 2003, our Synthetic Fuel business generated operating losses of $104 million, compared to $134 million in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was hurt by $53 million of lower incentive fees, which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging. 2002 Compared to 2001 Operating income decreased 24 percent to $321 million largely as a result of the $50 million write down of goodwill associated with our ExecuStay business. In addition, we recorded $134 million of operating losses associated with our Synthetic Fuel operation, which commenced operations in 2002. The comparisons to 2001 are impacted by the $155 million restructuring and other charges recorded against operating income in 2001 and a $40 million reduction in incentive fees resulting from the decline in hotel demand. 20 Marriott Lodging We consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. 2003 Compared to 2002 Lodging, which includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported financial results of $702 million in 2003, compared to $707 million in 2002 and revenues of $8,712 million in 2003, a 6 percent increase, compared to revenues of $8,222 million in 2002. The lodging revenue and financial results include the receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost revenues associated with the New York World Trade Center hotel. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $388 million, an increase of 2 percent, reflecting 3 percent growth in the number of managed rooms and a 1.9 percent decline in REVPAR for our North American managed hotels. Incentive management fees were $109 million, a decline of 33 percent, reflecting the decline in REVPAR as well as lower property level house profit. House profit margins declined 2.7 percentage points, largely due to lower average room rates, higher wages, insurance and utility costs, and lower telephone profits, offset by continued productivity improvements. Franchise fees totaled $245 million, an increase of 6 percent. The comparison to 2002 includes the impact of the $50 million pretax write down of ExecuStay goodwill recorded in 2002, partially offset by a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International. 2002 Compared to 2001 Lodging financial results increased 10 percent to $707 million, and revenues increased 6 percent to $8,222 million. Results reflected a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, a timeshare exchange company, and increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $379 million, an increase of 2 percent. Franchise fees totaled $232 million, an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were $162 million, a decline of 20 percent. The $50 million write down of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business, ExecuStay, reduced Lodging results in 2002. The 2002 comparisons are also impacted by $115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded against lodging results in 2001. Lodging Development Marriott Lodging opened 185 properties totaling over 31,000 rooms across its brands in 2003, while 24 hotels (approximately 4,000 rooms) exited the system. Highlights of the year included: We converted 72 properties (10,050 rooms), or 32 percent of our total room additions for the year from other brands. We opened approximately 35 percent of new rooms outside the United States. We added 97 properties (11,900 rooms) to our Select Service and Extended Stay brands. We opened six new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Hawaii, Spain, France, London, Florida and South Carolina. At year end 2003, we had over 300 hotel properties and approximately 50,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development. We expect to open over 175 hotels and timeshare resorts (approximately 25,000 to 30,000 rooms) in 2004. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. See Forward Looking Statements above and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. REVPAR We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. The following table shows occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our comparable principal established brands. We have not presented statistics for company operated North American Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites properties here (or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report) because we operate only a small number of properties as both these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands (identified as nm in the tables below). Systemwide 21 statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. Systemwide International statistics by region are based on comparable worldwide units, excluding North America.

The 3 percent increase in results includes the $36 million insurance payment received for lost management fees in connection with the loss of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The 2003 results also reflect an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, largely due to the growth in the number of rooms. Across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 88 hotels (18,000 rooms) and deflagged 15 hotels (3,000 rooms). We typically earn incentive fees only after a managed hotel achieves a minimum level of owner profitability. As a result, lower revenue and lower property level margins have reduced the number of hotels from which we earn incentive management fees. As a result, full service incentive fees declined $41 million in 2003. REVPAR for Full Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 1.6 percent to $90.57. Occupancy for these hotels was flat at 67.1 percent, while average room rates declined 1.6 percent to $134.92. REVPAR for our International systemwide hotels declined 1.5 percent. Occupancy declined 1 percentage point, while average room rates remained flat at $112.14. Our international operations increased 9 percent to $102 million, reflecting $21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an $8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in Istanbul, a $7 million charge to write down our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in January 2004, and the impact of the war and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on international travel earlier in the year. 2002 Compared to 2001 Full Service Lodging had revenues of $5,508 million, a 5 percent increase over prior year, and segment results of $397 million, an increase of 35 percent. The comparison reflects $84 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 results also reflect a $9 million increase in base management fees, largely due to the growth in the number of managed rooms. Franchise fees decreased $6 million primarily as a result of the transfer of the Ramada license agreements to the joint venture formed with Cendant Corporation. In 2001, we had franchise revenue associated with the Ramada license agreements, while in 2002 we had equity in earnings of the joint venture, the impact of the change in the Ramada structure was partially offset by higher franchise fees resulting from the growth in the number of franchised rooms. Across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 60 hotels (15,000 rooms) and deflagged 12 hotels (3,300 rooms). Full Service incentive fees were down $27 million due to the decline in the number of properties from which we earn incentive fees. REVPAR for Full Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 4.4 percent. Occupancy for these hotels was up slightly to 67.6 percent, while the average room rates declined 4.6 percent. International lodging reported an increase in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in Asia and the United Kingdom. The favorable comparison also reflects the restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Select Service Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 1,000 $ 967 $ 864 3% 12% Segment results $ 99 $ 130 $ 145 24% 10% 26 2003 Compared to 2002 Select Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands, had revenues of $1 billion, a 3 percent increase over the prior year, and segment results of $99 million compared to $130 million in 2002. The $31 million decrease reflects the impact of a $12 million reduction in base and incentive management fees, partially offset by a $3 million increase in franchise fees. The results also include $12 million of higher equity losses primarily from our Courtyard joint venture, formed in 2000, which owns 120 Courtyard hotels. In 2003, across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,000 rooms) and deflagged four hotels (700 rooms). Over 90 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. 2002 Compared to 2001 Select Service Lodging had revenues of $967 million, a 12 percent increase compared to the prior year, and segment results of $130 million compared to $145 million in 2002. The comparison to 2001 reflects $13 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The $15 million decrease in segment results reflects the impact of an $11 million reduction in base and incentive management fees, offset by a $13 million increase in franchise fees. The results also include $8 million of equity losses in 2002 compared to earnings of $5 million in 2001, primarily related to our Courtyard joint ventures. In 2002, across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 80 hotels (10,600 rooms) and deflagged 9 hotels (1,100 rooms). Eighty two percent of the gross room additions were franchised. Extended Stay Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 557 $ 600 $ 635 7% 6% Segment results $ 47 $ (3 ) $ 55 nm nm 2003 Compared to 2002 Extended Stay Lodging, which includes the Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands, had revenues of $557 million, a decrease of 7 percent, and segment results of $47 million compared to an operating loss of $3 million in 2002. In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million and our franchise fees increased $6 million. In 2003 we added 31 hotels (3,800 rooms) across our Extended Stay Lodging segment. Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged one property (100 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,300 units. 2002 Compared to 2001 Extended Stay Lodging had revenues of $600 million, a decrease of 6 percent, and an operating loss of $3 million compared to income of $55 million in 2001. In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million, and our franchise fees increased $5 million. The comparisons to 2001 were also impacted by $16 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. In 2002, across our Extended Stay Lodging segment, we added 44 hotels (5,400 rooms). Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged three properties (300 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,800 units. 27 Timeshare Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 1,279 $ 1,147 $ 1,009 12% 14% Segment results $ 149 $ 183 $ 147 19% 24% 2003 Compared to 2002 The results of our Timeshare segment (Marriott Vacation Club International, Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz Carlton Club and Marriott Grand Residence Club) decreased 19 percent to $149 million, while revenues increased 12 percent. Note sale gains in 2003 were $64 million compared to $60 million in 2002. Contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and South Carolina and soft in Lake Tahoe, Orlando and Williamsburg. The comparison to 2002 reflects the $44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in Interval International. Timeshare revenues of $1,279 million and $1,147 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively, includes interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. 2002 Compared to 2001 The financial results of our Timeshare segment increased 24 percent to $183 million, reflecting a 14 percent increase in revenues, note sale gains in 2002 of $60 million compared to $40 million in 2001, and a gain of $44 million related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, partially offset by lower development profits and higher depreciation on systems for customer support. Contract sales increased 5 percent. Synthetic Fuel In October 2001, we acquired four coal based synthetic fuel production facilities (the Facilities) for $46 million in cash. The synthetic fuel produced at the Facilities through 2007 qualifies for tax credits based on Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007). We began operating these Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. Operation of the Facilities, together with the benefit arising from the tax credits, has been, and we expect will continue to be, significantly accretive to our net income. Our synthetic fuel operation generated net income of $96 million and $74 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. Although the Facilities produce significant losses, these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section 29, which reduce our income tax expense. In fiscal year 2003, our synthetic fuel operation reflected sales of $302 million, equity income of $10 million and an operating loss of $104 million, resulting in a tax benefit of $245 million, including tax credits of $211 million, offset by minority interest expense of $55 million. On June 21, 2003, we completed the previously announced sale of an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation. We received cash and promissory notes totaling $25 million at closing, and we are receiving additional profits that we expect will continue over the life of the venture based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser. We earned $56 million of such additional profits in 2003. Certain post closing conditions, including our receipt of satisfactory private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, were satisfied during the fourth quarter. Those rulings confirm, among other things, both that the process used by our synthetic fuel operations produces a qualified fuel as required by Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code and the validity of the joint venture ownership structure with the 50 percent purchaser. After reviewing the private letter rulings, the purchaser informed us in writing that it would not be exercising a one time put option, which would potentially have allowed it to return its ownership interest to us if satisfactory rulings had not been obtained prior to December 15, 2003. As a result of the put option, we continued to consolidate the synthetic fuel operation through November 6, 2003. Effective November 7, 2003, because the put option was voided, we account for the Synthetic Fuel joint venture using the equity method of accounting. The $24 million of additional profits we received from the joint venture partner beginning November 7, 2003, along with our share of the equity in losses of the synthetic fuel joint venture, are reflected in the income statement under Equity in earnings/(losses) from synthetic fuel. The additional profits earned prior to November 7, 2003, along with the revenue generated from the previously consolidated synthetic fuel joint venture, are included in synthetic fuel revenue in the income statement. We will continue to record the benefit of our share of the tax credits in our financial statements as a reduction of our tax provision. Going forward, we expect net income will continue to benefit from our participation in the joint venture because of the subsequent tax benefits and credits, as well as the earn out payments from our venture partner; however, the ultimate impact will depend on the production levels of the synthetic fuel operation and is directly tied to the amount of coal produced. 28 General, Administrative and Other Expenses 2003 Compared to 2002 General, administrative and other expenses increased $13 million in 2003 to $523 million, reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 (our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003). The expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of $7 million, compared to losses of $6 million in 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001 General, administrative and other expenses decreased $145 million in 2002 to $510 million, primarily reflecting the following: (i) 2002 items, including a $9 million reserve recorded in connection with a lawsuit involving the sale of a hotel previously managed by us, $3 million of higher litigation expenses, and $9 million of lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan; (ii) 2001 items, including $155 million of restructuring costs and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 associated with the downturn in the economy and the impact of the September 11, 2001 attacks, $13 million related to the write down of two investments in technology partners; $29 million of goodwill amortization expense (in accordance with FAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill in 2002) $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2004, January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Timeshare note sale gains $ 64 $ 60 $ 40 Gains on sale of real estate 21 28 38 Gains on sales of three international joint ventures 21 Gain on sale of investment in Interval International 44 $ 106 $ 132 $ 78 Interest Expense 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest expense increased $24 million to $110 million reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities, and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our timeshare segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, $234 million of senior debt was repaid. The weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent. 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest expense decreased $23 million to $86 million, reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates, partially offset by lower capitalized interest. Interest Income and Income Tax 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest income increased $7 million (6 percent) to $129 million. The provision for loan losses for 2003 was $7 million and includes $15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels, offset by the reversal of $8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003, compared to a tax provision of $32 million in 2002. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $245 million in 2003, compared to $208 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation, our pretax income was lower in 2003, which also contributed to the favorable tax impact. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 15.7 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. 29 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest income increased $28 million to $122 million, before reflecting reserves of $12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels. The increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized that were previously deemed uncollectible. The comparison to 2001 also reflects a $6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2002 from 36.1 percent in 2001, primarily due to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $208 million. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 35.4 percent to 15.7 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services In December 2001, management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months. We recorded an impairment charge of $60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value for the year ended December 28, 2001. On October 1, 2002, we completed the sale of these properties for $62 million, which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by $11 million. We included the $11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. In the second quarter of 2002, we sold five senior living communities for $59 million. We ceased operating these communities under our previously existing long term management agreements. We accounted for these sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66. We continue to provide an operating profit guarantee to the buyer, and fundings under that guarantee are applied against the initial deferred gain of $6 million. As of January 2, 2004, the remaining deferred gain was $3 million. On December 17, 2002, we sold 12 senior living communities to CNL for approximately $89 million. We accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66, and we recorded an after tax loss of approximately $13 million. On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc. and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL. We completed the sales to Sunrise and CNL and a related sale of a parcel of land to Sunrise, in March 2003 for $266 million and recognized a gain, net of taxes, of $23 million. On December 30, 2002, we purchased 14 senior living communities from an unrelated owner for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt. We had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. Management approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. As part of that plan, on March 31, 2003, we acquired all of the subordinated credit enhanced mortgage securities relating to the 14 communities in a transaction in which we issued $46 million of unsecured Marriott International, Inc. notes, due April 2004. In the 2003 third quarter, we sold the 14 communities to CNL for approximately $184 million. We provided a $92 million acquisition loan to CNL in connection with the sale. Sunrise currently operates and will continue to operate the 14 communities under long term management agreements. We recorded a gain, net of taxes, of $1 million. For the year ended January 3, 2003, we had recorded an after tax charge of $131 million associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business. Accordingly, we report the operating results of our senior living segment in discontinued operations during the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003 and the remaining assets and liabilities were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities of businesses held for sale, respectively, on the balance sheet at January 3, 2003. Distribution Services In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of our Distribution Services business and decided to exit that business. We completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities, closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements. In the year ended January 3, 2003, we recognized a pretax charge of $65 million in connection with the decision to exit this business. The charge includes: (1) $15 million for payments to third parties to subsidize their assumption of, or in some cases to terminate, existing distribution or warehouse lease contracts; (2) $9 million for severance costs; (3) $10 million related to the adjusting of fixed assets to net realizable values; (4) $2 million related to inventory losses; (5) $15 million for losses on equipment leases; (6) $10 million for losses on warehouse leases; and 30 (7) $4 million of other associated charges. For the year ended January 2, 2004, we incurred exit costs, net of tax, of $2 million, primarily related to ongoing compensation costs associated with the wind down. We also reversed $2 million, net of tax, for previously estimated exit costs, which we deemed no longer necessary. 2001 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The Company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy. This decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In 2001, we responded by implementing certain companywide cost saving measures, although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations. As a result of our restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded pretax restructuring costs of $62 million, including (1) $15 million in severance costs; (2) $19 million primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $28 million related to the write off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We also incurred $142 million of other charges including (1) $85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses; (2) $12 million related to accounts receivable reserves; (3) $13 million related to the write down of properties held for sale; and (4) $32 million related to the impairment of technology related investments and other write offs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for aggregate borrowings of up to $2 billion, expiring in 2006 ($1.5 billion expiring in July and $500 million expiring in August), which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. We entered into the $500 million facility during the third quarter of 2003, replacing a similar facility that would have expired in February 2004. At January 2, 2004, we had no loans outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. At January 2, 2004, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately $2.1 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are presented in the following table: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Cash from operations $ 421 $ 516 $ 403 Depreciation expense 132 145 142 Amortization expense 28 42 80 31 While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The net operating activity from our timeshare business (which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business, as that number is a component of income from continuing operations) is shown in the following table: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ (94 ) $ (102 ) $ (253 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (284 ) (280 ) (320 ) Note sale gains (64 ) (60 ) (40 ) Financially reportable sales, (in excess of) less than closed sales (4 ) (13 ) 53 Note sale proceeds 281 387 199 Net fees received for servicing notes 17 31 26 Other cash inflows (outflows) 37 (26 ) (23 ) Net cash outflows from timeshare activity $ (111 ) $ (63 ) $ (358 ) In 2002, other cash flows from operating activities of $223 million included an adjustment for $186 million, related to the exit of our Senior Living Services and Distribution Services businesses, and an adjustment for $50 million, related to the impairment of goodwill of our ExecuStay brand. In 2001, other cash flows from operating activities of $278 million included an adjustment for $248 million, related to non cash restructuring and other charges. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $745 million in 2003, $551 million in 2002 and $701 million in 2001. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. However, EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure, and is not an alternative to net income, financial results, or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA is as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 502 $ 277 $ 236 Interest expense 110 86 109 Tax (benefit) provision continuing operations (43 ) 32 152 Tax provision (benefit) discontinued operations 16 (31 ) (18 ) Depreciation 132 145 142 Amortization 28 42 80 $ 745 $ 551 $ 701 Reducing net income are losses associated with our synthetic fuel operations of $104 million and $134 million, respectively, for the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003. Also effecting our 2003 net income is equity in earnings from Synthetic Fuel of $10 million and minority interest expense of $55 million. The Synthetic Fuel operating losses include depreciation expense of $8 million for both the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003. There was no loss or depreciation expense associated with our synthetic fuel operations for the year ended December 28, 2001, since operations did not commence until to 2002. Also included in net income above is income from our discontinued senior living services business of $26 million in 2003 and losses of $108 million and $29 million, for 2002 and 2001, respectively, as well as losses from our discontinued distribution services business of $54 million and $4 million, respectively for 2002 and 2001. There were no losses associated with our distribution services business in 2003. Included above is depreciation and amortization expense related to our discontinued operations of $37 million and $44 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. There was no depreciation or amortization expense for our discontinued operations in 2003. A substantial portion of both our net income and therefore EBITDA is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. These include lodging base management fees, franchise fees and land rent. With over 2,700 hotels in the Marriott system, no single property or region is critical to our financial results. 32 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.7 to 1 at January 2, 2004, compared to 0.8 to 1 at January 3, 2003. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital. In 2003 we sold $281 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare business. We recognized gains on these sales of $64 million in the year ended January 2, 2004. Our ability to continue to sell these timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. Also, we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. In connection with these timeshare note sales, at January 2, 2004, we had repurchase obligations of $19 million related to notes receivable we have sold. We do not expect to incur material losses in respect of those obligations. We retain interests in the notes, which are accounted for as residual interests, and in the year ended January 2, 2004, we received cash flows of $47 million from those retained interests. At January 2, 2004, the special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of $733 million. Investing Activities Cash Flows Acquisitions. We continually seek opportunities to enter new markets, increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions. Dispositions. Property sales generated cash proceeds of $494 million in 2003, $729 million in 2002 and $554 million in 2001. Proceeds in 2003 are net of a $92 million note receivable and closing costs and other items totaling $25 million. In 2003, we closed on the sales of three hotels and 23 senior living communities. We continue to operate all of the hotels under long term operating agreements. Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $210 million in 2003, $292 million in 2002 and $560 million in 2001 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties. Over time, we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development, or to be developed, while continuing to operate them under long term agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. A summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below. ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Equity investments $ (22 ) $ (26 ) $ (33 ) Investment in corporate owned life insurance (12 ) (11 ) (97 ) Other net cash outflows (5 ) (33 ) (131 ) Cash proceeds on sale of investment in Interval International 63 Sale of affordable housing tax credit investments 82 Other investing outflows $ (39 ) $ (7 ) $ (179 ) Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. We have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business. Loans outstanding, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $996 million at January 2, 2004, $944 million at January 3, 2003, and $860 million at December 28, 2001. Unfunded commitments aggregating $80 million were outstanding at January 2, 2004, of which we expect to fund $44 million in 2004 and $60 million in total. We participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third party ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise. 33 Cash from Financing Activities Debt decreased $319 million in 2003, due to the $200 million repayment, at maturity, of Series A debt in November 2003 and the net pay down of $161 million of commercial paper and other debt. Debt decreased by $945 million in 2002, due to the redemption of 85 percent of the LYONs in May 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility, offset by the debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities in December 2002. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2003, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 7.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.8 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.99 as of January 2, 2004. At January 2, 2004, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. We have $500 million available for future offerings under universal shelf registration statements we have filed with the SEC. In January 2001, we issued, through a private placement, $300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008 and received net proceeds of $297 million. We completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on January 15, 2002. On May 8, 2001, we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021, also known as LYONs, and received cash proceeds of $405 million. On May 9, 2002, we redeemed for cash approximately 85 percent of that issue which the LYONs holders tendered for mandatory repurchase. The remaining LYONs are convertible into approximately 0.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and carry a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent. We may redeem the LYONs on or after May 8, 2004. The holders may also at their option require us to purchase the LYONs at their accreted value on May 8 of each of 2004, 2011 and 2016. We may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash and or shares of our Class A Common Stock. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Debt $ 1,455 $ 64 $ 508 $ 313 $ 570 Capital lease obligations 11 1 2 1 7 Operating leases Recourse 1,163 105 189 196 673 Non recourse 623 42 94 94 393 Other long term liabilities 70 9 8 8 45 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,322 $ 221 $ 801 $ 612 $ 1,688 The following table summarizes our commitments as of January 2, 2004: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Guarantees $ 1,182 $ 133 $ 354 $ 249 $ 446 Timeshare note repurchase obligations 19 19 Total $ 1,201 $ 133 $ 354 $ 249 $ 465 34 Our guarantees listed above include $238 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of hotels. When we repurchase non performing timeshare loans, we either collect the outstanding loan balance in full or foreclose on the asset and subsequently resell it. Our guarantees include $387 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. Our guarantees also include $47 million of other guarantees associated with the Sunrise sale transaction. As a result of the settlement with Five Star, discussed in Item 3, $41 million of these guarantees included above expired subsequent to January 2, 2004. Our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $80 million at January 2, 2004. We expect to fund $44 million of those commitments within one year and $16 million in one to three years. We do not expect to fund the remaining $20 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $8 million in one to three years; and $12 million after five years. As part of the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 35 Related Party Transactions We have equity method investments in entities that own hotels for which we provide management and or franchise services and we receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Base management fees $ 56 $ 48 $ 48 Incentive management fees 4 4 4 Cost reimbursements 699 557 559 Other income 28 26 28 Total Revenue $ 787 $ 635 $ 639 General, administrative and other $ (11 ) $ (11 ) $ (15 ) Reimbursed costs (699 ) (557 ) (559 ) Interest income 77 66 51 Provision for loan losses (2 ) (5 ) Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Due to equity method investees $ (2 ) $ (1 ) Due from equity method investees 623 532 Share Repurchases. We purchased 10.5 million of our shares in 2003 at an average price of $36.07 per share, 7.8 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of $32.52 per share, and 6.1 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of $38.20 per share. As of January 2, 2004, 13 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In May 2003, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 7 percent to $0.075 per share. Other Matters Inflation. Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Critical Accounting Policies. Certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters. Our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the United States, although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact. We have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. Incentive Fees We recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract. In interim periods, we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. If we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying full year performance thresholds were certain, the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged, but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter. We recognized incentive fee revenue of $109 million, $162 million and $202 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cost Reimbursements We incur certain reimbursable costs on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred, we report cost reimbursements from managed properties and franchisees as revenue, and we report the costs incurred on behalf of managed properties and franchisees as expenses. Cost 36 reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin or mark up. These reimbursed costs relate primarily to payroll costs at domestic properties that we manage, but also include costs associated with certain materials and services. Our financial statements reflect cost reimbursements of $6.2 billion in 2003, $5.7 billion in 2002, and $5.2 billion in 2001. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with FAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $4 million in 2003, $51 million in 2002 and $16 million in 2001. Our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under FAS No. 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules. Timeshare Sales We also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with FAS No. 66. We recognize sales when (1) we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval, (2) the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired, (3) we deem the receivables to be collectible, and (4) we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects that are attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until we have recognized the sale. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. Under this approach, we capitalized selling and marketing costs of approximately $69 million and $107 million at January 2, 2004, and January 3, 2003, respectively, and have included those costs in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a contract is cancelled, we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record forfeited deposits as income. Residual Interests We periodically sell the notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the assets transferred to entities that are accounted for as residual interests. The residual interests are treated as trading or available for sale securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for available for sale securities. We had residual interests of $203 million at January 2, 2004 and $135 million at January 3, 2003, which are recorded as long term receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At January 2, 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $142 million. We have a $61 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, 37 including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, and communicating with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long Lived Assets We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections. We evaluate the potential impairment of other intangible assets whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. Our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections. We record an impairment loss for goodwill and other intangible assets when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. 38 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or in how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate timeshare and notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals, and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At January 2, 2004, we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. We are required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $726 million, and they expire through 2022. Twenty four forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during fiscal year 2004. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is approximately $37 million, and the forward contracts expire throughout 2004. Two forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets denominated in Pounds Sterling. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $34 million at January 2, 2004. 39 The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of January 2, 2004: Maturities by Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent principal receipts, fair values represent assets.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,718 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments, Full Service Lodging, Select Service Lodging, Extended Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 14 separate brand names in 68 countries. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business: (1) selling timeshare intervals, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our Synthetic Fuel joint venture. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. This historically challenging time in the lodging industry has demonstrated Marriott Internationals resilience, the strength of our business model, superior brands, strong management team and dedicated associates. We are optimistic about a stronger business climate in 2004. And with the final disposition of our senior living and distribution services businesses in 2003, we look forward to operating as a focused lodging and timeshare company for the first time in our 76 year history. In 2003, we grew productivity at the hotel level leveraging our buying power and systems. Greater integration of sophisticated scheduling systems reduced hours worked per occupied room by over 10 percent in 2003 over 2000 levels for participating hotels. In addition, food and supply costs were reduced due to greater participation in our centralized procurement and accounts payable systems. By pooling risk among our managed hotel portfolio, we continued to purchase insurance at a lower cost than any property could purchase alone. By the end of 2003, we had high speed internet access available in approximately 1,400 hotels, far outpacing our competition. We also introduced wireless internet access in lobbies, meeting rooms and public spaces in over 900 hotels in the U.S. during the year. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended January 2, 2004, January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. Continuing Operations Revenues ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Full Service $ 5,876 $ 5,508 $ 5,260 Select Service 1,000 967 864 Extended Stay 557 600 635 Timeshare 1,279 1,147 1,009 Total lodging 8,712 8,222 7,768 Synthetic fuel 302 193 $ 9,014 $ 8,415 $ 7,768 19 Income from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Full Service $ 407 $ 397 $ 294 Select Service 99 130 145 Extended Stay 47 (3 ) 55 Timeshare 149 183 147 Total lodging financial results (pretax) 702 707 641 Synthetic fuel (after tax) 96 74 Unallocated corporate expenses (132 ) (126 ) (157 ) Interest income, provision for loan losses and interest expense 12 24 (63 ) Income taxes (excluding Synthetic fuel) (202 ) (240 ) (152 ) $ 476 $ 439 $ 269 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenues from continuing operations increased 7 percent to $9 billion in 2003 reflecting revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94. Synthetic Fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002. Our lodging financial results declined $5 million, to $702 million in 2003. The comparisons from 2002 benefit from the $50 million pretax charge to write down acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay in 2002, offset by the $44 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International in 2002, and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. 2002 Compared to 2001 Revenues from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $8.4 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales of our new Synthetic Fuel operation and revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by a slowdown in the economy and the resulting decline in lodging demand. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 63 percent to $439 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to $1.74. Income from continuing operations reflected $74 million associated with our synthetic fuel operation, the results also reflected a $44 million pretax 2002 gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International, offset by the $50 million pretax 2002 charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay and the decreased 2002 demand for hotel rooms and executive apartments. The comparisons to 2001 include the impact of the $204 million pretax restructuring and other charges that we recorded against continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating Income 2003 Compared to 2002 Operating income increased 17 percent to $377 million in 2003. The favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the $50 million write down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our ExecuStay business, the 2003 receipt of $36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our Synthetic Fuel operation. In 2003, our Synthetic Fuel business generated operating losses of $104 million, compared to $134 million in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was hurt by $53 million of lower incentive fees, which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging. 2002 Compared to 2001 Operating income decreased 24 percent to $321 million largely as a result of the $50 million write down of goodwill associated with our ExecuStay business. In addition, we recorded $134 million of operating losses associated with our Synthetic Fuel operation, which commenced operations in 2002. The comparisons to 2001 are impacted by the $155 million restructuring and other charges recorded against operating income in 2001 and a $40 million reduction in incentive fees resulting from the decline in hotel demand. 20 Marriott Lodging We consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. 2003 Compared to 2002 Lodging, which includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay, and Timeshare segments, reported financial results of $702 million in 2003, compared to $707 million in 2002 and revenues of $8,712 million in 2003, a 6 percent increase, compared to revenues of $8,222 million in 2002. The lodging revenue and financial results include the receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost revenues associated with the New York World Trade Center hotel. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $388 million, an increase of 2 percent, reflecting 3 percent growth in the number of managed rooms and a 1.9 percent decline in REVPAR for our North American managed hotels. Incentive management fees were $109 million, a decline of 33 percent, reflecting the decline in REVPAR as well as lower property level house profit. House profit margins declined 2.7 percentage points, largely due to lower average room rates, higher wages, insurance and utility costs, and lower telephone profits, offset by continued productivity improvements. Franchise fees totaled $245 million, an increase of 6 percent. The comparison to 2002 includes the impact of the $50 million pretax write down of ExecuStay goodwill recorded in 2002, partially offset by a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International. 2002 Compared to 2001 Lodging financial results increased 10 percent to $707 million, and revenues increased 6 percent to $8,222 million. Results reflected a $44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, a timeshare exchange company, and increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $379 million, an increase of 2 percent. Franchise fees totaled $232 million, an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were $162 million, a decline of 20 percent. The $50 million write down of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business, ExecuStay, reduced Lodging results in 2002. The 2002 comparisons are also impacted by $115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded against lodging results in 2001. Lodging Development Marriott Lodging opened 185 properties totaling over 31,000 rooms across its brands in 2003, while 24 hotels (approximately 4,000 rooms) exited the system. Highlights of the year included: We converted 72 properties (10,050 rooms), or 32 percent of our total room additions for the year from other brands. We opened approximately 35 percent of new rooms outside the United States. We added 97 properties (11,900 rooms) to our Select Service and Extended Stay brands. We opened six new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Hawaii, Spain, France, London, Florida and South Carolina. At year end 2003, we had over 300 hotel properties and approximately 50,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development. We expect to open over 175 hotels and timeshare resorts (approximately 25,000 to 30,000 rooms) in 2004. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. See Forward Looking Statements above and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. REVPAR We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. The following table shows occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our comparable principal established brands. We have not presented statistics for company operated North American Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites properties here (or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report) because we operate only a small number of properties as both these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands (identified as nm in the tables below). Systemwide 21 statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. Systemwide International statistics by region are based on comparable worldwide units, excluding North America.

The 3 percent increase in results includes the $36 million insurance payment received for lost management fees in connection with the loss of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The 2003 results also reflect an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, largely due to the growth in the number of rooms. Across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 88 hotels (18,000 rooms) and deflagged 15 hotels (3,000 rooms). We typically earn incentive fees only after a managed hotel achieves a minimum level of owner profitability. As a result, lower revenue and lower property level margins have reduced the number of hotels from which we earn incentive management fees. As a result, full service incentive fees declined $41 million in 2003. REVPAR for Full Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 1.6 percent to $90.57. Occupancy for these hotels was flat at 67.1 percent, while average room rates declined 1.6 percent to $134.92. REVPAR for our International systemwide hotels declined 1.5 percent. Occupancy declined 1 percentage point, while average room rates remained flat at $112.14. Our international operations increased 9 percent to $102 million, reflecting $21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an $8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in Istanbul, a $7 million charge to write down our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in January 2004, and the impact of the war and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on international travel earlier in the year. 2002 Compared to 2001 Full Service Lodging had revenues of $5,508 million, a 5 percent increase over prior year, and segment results of $397 million, an increase of 35 percent. The comparison reflects $84 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 results also reflect a $9 million increase in base management fees, largely due to the growth in the number of managed rooms. Franchise fees decreased $6 million primarily as a result of the transfer of the Ramada license agreements to the joint venture formed with Cendant Corporation. In 2001, we had franchise revenue associated with the Ramada license agreements, while in 2002 we had equity in earnings of the joint venture, the impact of the change in the Ramada structure was partially offset by higher franchise fees resulting from the growth in the number of franchised rooms. Across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 60 hotels (15,000 rooms) and deflagged 12 hotels (3,300 rooms). Full Service incentive fees were down $27 million due to the decline in the number of properties from which we earn incentive fees. REVPAR for Full Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 4.4 percent. Occupancy for these hotels was up slightly to 67.6 percent, while the average room rates declined 4.6 percent. International lodging reported an increase in the results of operations, reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in Asia and the United Kingdom. The favorable comparison also reflects the restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Select Service Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 1,000 $ 967 $ 864 3% 12% Segment results $ 99 $ 130 $ 145 24% 10% 26 2003 Compared to 2002 Select Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands, had revenues of $1 billion, a 3 percent increase over the prior year, and segment results of $99 million compared to $130 million in 2002. The $31 million decrease reflects the impact of a $12 million reduction in base and incentive management fees, partially offset by a $3 million increase in franchise fees. The results also include $12 million of higher equity losses primarily from our Courtyard joint venture, formed in 2000, which owns 120 Courtyard hotels. In 2003, across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,000 rooms) and deflagged four hotels (700 rooms). Over 90 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. 2002 Compared to 2001 Select Service Lodging had revenues of $967 million, a 12 percent increase compared to the prior year, and segment results of $130 million compared to $145 million in 2002. The comparison to 2001 reflects $13 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The $15 million decrease in segment results reflects the impact of an $11 million reduction in base and incentive management fees, offset by a $13 million increase in franchise fees. The results also include $8 million of equity losses in 2002 compared to earnings of $5 million in 2001, primarily related to our Courtyard joint ventures. In 2002, across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 80 hotels (10,600 rooms) and deflagged 9 hotels (1,100 rooms). Eighty two percent of the gross room additions were franchised. Extended Stay Lodging Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 557 $ 600 $ 635 7% 6% Segment results $ 47 $ (3 ) $ 55 nm nm 2003 Compared to 2002 Extended Stay Lodging, which includes the Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands, had revenues of $557 million, a decrease of 7 percent, and segment results of $47 million compared to an operating loss of $3 million in 2002. In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million and our franchise fees increased $6 million. In 2003 we added 31 hotels (3,800 rooms) across our Extended Stay Lodging segment. Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged one property (100 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,300 units. 2002 Compared to 2001 Extended Stay Lodging had revenues of $600 million, a decrease of 6 percent, and an operating loss of $3 million compared to income of $55 million in 2001. In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million, and our franchise fees increased $5 million. The comparisons to 2001 were also impacted by $16 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. In 2002, across our Extended Stay Lodging segment, we added 44 hotels (5,400 rooms). Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged three properties (300 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,800 units. 27 Timeshare Annual Change ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Revenues $ 1,279 $ 1,147 $ 1,009 12% 14% Segment results $ 149 $ 183 $ 147 19% 24% 2003 Compared to 2002 The results of our Timeshare segment (Marriott Vacation Club International, Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz Carlton Club and Marriott Grand Residence Club) decreased 19 percent to $149 million, while revenues increased 12 percent. Note sale gains in 2003 were $64 million compared to $60 million in 2002. Contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and South Carolina and soft in Lake Tahoe, Orlando and Williamsburg. The comparison to 2002 reflects the $44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in Interval International. Timeshare revenues of $1,279 million and $1,147 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively, includes interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. 2002 Compared to 2001 The financial results of our Timeshare segment increased 24 percent to $183 million, reflecting a 14 percent increase in revenues, note sale gains in 2002 of $60 million compared to $40 million in 2001, and a gain of $44 million related to the sale of our investment in Interval International, partially offset by lower development profits and higher depreciation on systems for customer support. Contract sales increased 5 percent. Synthetic Fuel In October 2001, we acquired four coal based synthetic fuel production facilities (the Facilities) for $46 million in cash. The synthetic fuel produced at the Facilities through 2007 qualifies for tax credits based on Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007). We began operating these Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. Operation of the Facilities, together with the benefit arising from the tax credits, has been, and we expect will continue to be, significantly accretive to our net income. Our synthetic fuel operation generated net income of $96 million and $74 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. Although the Facilities produce significant losses, these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section 29, which reduce our income tax expense. In fiscal year 2003, our synthetic fuel operation reflected sales of $302 million, equity income of $10 million and an operating loss of $104 million, resulting in a tax benefit of $245 million, including tax credits of $211 million, offset by minority interest expense of $55 million. On June 21, 2003, we completed the previously announced sale of an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation. We received cash and promissory notes totaling $25 million at closing, and we are receiving additional profits that we expect will continue over the life of the venture based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser. We earned $56 million of such additional profits in 2003. Certain post closing conditions, including our receipt of satisfactory private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, were satisfied during the fourth quarter. Those rulings confirm, among other things, both that the process used by our synthetic fuel operations produces a qualified fuel as required by Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code and the validity of the joint venture ownership structure with the 50 percent purchaser. After reviewing the private letter rulings, the purchaser informed us in writing that it would not be exercising a one time put option, which would potentially have allowed it to return its ownership interest to us if satisfactory rulings had not been obtained prior to December 15, 2003. As a result of the put option, we continued to consolidate the synthetic fuel operation through November 6, 2003. Effective November 7, 2003, because the put option was voided, we account for the Synthetic Fuel joint venture using the equity method of accounting. The $24 million of additional profits we received from the joint venture partner beginning November 7, 2003, along with our share of the equity in losses of the synthetic fuel joint venture, are reflected in the income statement under Equity in earnings/(losses) from synthetic fuel. The additional profits earned prior to November 7, 2003, along with the revenue generated from the previously consolidated synthetic fuel joint venture, are included in synthetic fuel revenue in the income statement. We will continue to record the benefit of our share of the tax credits in our financial statements as a reduction of our tax provision. Going forward, we expect net income will continue to benefit from our participation in the joint venture because of the subsequent tax benefits and credits, as well as the earn out payments from our venture partner; however, the ultimate impact will depend on the production levels of the synthetic fuel operation and is directly tied to the amount of coal produced. 28 General, Administrative and Other Expenses 2003 Compared to 2002 General, administrative and other expenses increased $13 million in 2003 to $523 million, reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 (our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003). The expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of $7 million, compared to losses of $6 million in 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001 General, administrative and other expenses decreased $145 million in 2002 to $510 million, primarily reflecting the following: (i) 2002 items, including a $9 million reserve recorded in connection with a lawsuit involving the sale of a hotel previously managed by us, $3 million of higher litigation expenses, and $9 million of lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan; (ii) 2001 items, including $155 million of restructuring costs and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 associated with the downturn in the economy and the impact of the September 11, 2001 attacks, $13 million related to the write down of two investments in technology partners; $29 million of goodwill amortization expense (in accordance with FAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill in 2002) $11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a $10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2004, January 3, 2003 and December 28, 2001. ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Timeshare note sale gains $ 64 $ 60 $ 40 Gains on sale of real estate 21 28 38 Gains on sales of three international joint ventures 21 Gain on sale of investment in Interval International 44 $ 106 $ 132 $ 78 Interest Expense 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest expense increased $24 million to $110 million reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities, and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our timeshare segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, $234 million of senior debt was repaid. The weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent. 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest expense decreased $23 million to $86 million, reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates, partially offset by lower capitalized interest. Interest Income and Income Tax 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest income increased $7 million (6 percent) to $129 million. The provision for loan losses for 2003 was $7 million and includes $15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels, offset by the reversal of $8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003, compared to a tax provision of $32 million in 2002. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $245 million in 2003, compared to $208 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation, our pretax income was lower in 2003, which also contributed to the favorable tax impact. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 15.7 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. 29 2002 Compared to 2001 Interest income increased $28 million to $122 million, before reflecting reserves of $12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels. The increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized that were previously deemed uncollectible. The comparison to 2001 also reflects a $6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 6.8 percent in 2002 from 36.1 percent in 2001, primarily due to the impact of our Synthetic Fuel operation which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $208 million. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 35.4 percent to 15.7 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services In December 2001, management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months. We recorded an impairment charge of $60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value for the year ended December 28, 2001. On October 1, 2002, we completed the sale of these properties for $62 million, which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by $11 million. We included the $11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended January 3, 2003. In the second quarter of 2002, we sold five senior living communities for $59 million. We ceased operating these communities under our previously existing long term management agreements. We accounted for these sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66. We continue to provide an operating profit guarantee to the buyer, and fundings under that guarantee are applied against the initial deferred gain of $6 million. As of January 2, 2004, the remaining deferred gain was $3 million. On December 17, 2002, we sold 12 senior living communities to CNL for approximately $89 million. We accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No. 66, and we recorded an after tax loss of approximately $13 million. On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc. and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL. We completed the sales to Sunrise and CNL and a related sale of a parcel of land to Sunrise, in March 2003 for $266 million and recognized a gain, net of taxes, of $23 million. On December 30, 2002, we purchased 14 senior living communities from an unrelated owner for approximately $15 million in cash, plus the assumption of $227 million in debt. We had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities. Management approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months. As part of that plan, on March 31, 2003, we acquired all of the subordinated credit enhanced mortgage securities relating to the 14 communities in a transaction in which we issued $46 million of unsecured Marriott International, Inc. notes, due April 2004. In the 2003 third quarter, we sold the 14 communities to CNL for approximately $184 million. We provided a $92 million acquisition loan to CNL in connection with the sale. Sunrise currently operates and will continue to operate the 14 communities under long term management agreements. We recorded a gain, net of taxes, of $1 million. For the year ended January 3, 2003, we had recorded an after tax charge of $131 million associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business. Accordingly, we report the operating results of our senior living segment in discontinued operations during the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003 and the remaining assets and liabilities were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities of businesses held for sale, respectively, on the balance sheet at January 3, 2003. Distribution Services In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of our Distribution Services business and decided to exit that business. We completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities, closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements. In the year ended January 3, 2003, we recognized a pretax charge of $65 million in connection with the decision to exit this business. The charge includes: (1) $15 million for payments to third parties to subsidize their assumption of, or in some cases to terminate, existing distribution or warehouse lease contracts; (2) $9 million for severance costs; (3) $10 million related to the adjusting of fixed assets to net realizable values; (4) $2 million related to inventory losses; (5) $15 million for losses on equipment leases; (6) $10 million for losses on warehouse leases; and 30 (7) $4 million of other associated charges. For the year ended January 2, 2004, we incurred exit costs, net of tax, of $2 million, primarily related to ongoing compensation costs associated with the wind down. We also reversed $2 million, net of tax, for previously estimated exit costs, which we deemed no longer necessary. 2001 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The Company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy. This decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In 2001, we responded by implementing certain companywide cost saving measures, although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations. As a result of our restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded pretax restructuring costs of $62 million, including (1) $15 million in severance costs; (2) $19 million primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $28 million related to the write off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We also incurred $142 million of other charges including (1) $85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses; (2) $12 million related to accounts receivable reserves; (3) $13 million related to the write down of properties held for sale; and (4) $32 million related to the impairment of technology related investments and other write offs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for aggregate borrowings of up to $2 billion, expiring in 2006 ($1.5 billion expiring in July and $500 million expiring in August), which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. We entered into the $500 million facility during the third quarter of 2003, replacing a similar facility that would have expired in February 2004. At January 2, 2004, we had no loans outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. At January 2, 2004, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately $2.1 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are presented in the following table: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Cash from operations $ 421 $ 516 $ 403 Depreciation expense 132 145 142 Amortization expense 28 42 80 31 While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The net operating activity from our timeshare business (which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business, as that number is a component of income from continuing operations) is shown in the following table: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ (94 ) $ (102 ) $ (253 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (284 ) (280 ) (320 ) Note sale gains (64 ) (60 ) (40 ) Financially reportable sales, (in excess of) less than closed sales (4 ) (13 ) 53 Note sale proceeds 281 387 199 Net fees received for servicing notes 17 31 26 Other cash inflows (outflows) 37 (26 ) (23 ) Net cash outflows from timeshare activity $ (111 ) $ (63 ) $ (358 ) In 2002, other cash flows from operating activities of $223 million included an adjustment for $186 million, related to the exit of our Senior Living Services and Distribution Services businesses, and an adjustment for $50 million, related to the impairment of goodwill of our ExecuStay brand. In 2001, other cash flows from operating activities of $278 million included an adjustment for $248 million, related to non cash restructuring and other charges. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $745 million in 2003, $551 million in 2002 and $701 million in 2001. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. However, EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure, and is not an alternative to net income, financial results, or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA is as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 502 $ 277 $ 236 Interest expense 110 86 109 Tax (benefit) provision continuing operations (43 ) 32 152 Tax provision (benefit) discontinued operations 16 (31 ) (18 ) Depreciation 132 145 142 Amortization 28 42 80 $ 745 $ 551 $ 701 Reducing net income are losses associated with our synthetic fuel operations of $104 million and $134 million, respectively, for the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003. Also effecting our 2003 net income is equity in earnings from Synthetic Fuel of $10 million and minority interest expense of $55 million. The Synthetic Fuel operating losses include depreciation expense of $8 million for both the years ended January 2, 2004 and January 3, 2003. There was no loss or depreciation expense associated with our synthetic fuel operations for the year ended December 28, 2001, since operations did not commence until to 2002. Also included in net income above is income from our discontinued senior living services business of $26 million in 2003 and losses of $108 million and $29 million, for 2002 and 2001, respectively, as well as losses from our discontinued distribution services business of $54 million and $4 million, respectively for 2002 and 2001. There were no losses associated with our distribution services business in 2003. Included above is depreciation and amortization expense related to our discontinued operations of $37 million and $44 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. There was no depreciation or amortization expense for our discontinued operations in 2003. A substantial portion of both our net income and therefore EBITDA is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales. These include lodging base management fees, franchise fees and land rent. With over 2,700 hotels in the Marriott system, no single property or region is critical to our financial results. 32 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.7 to 1 at January 2, 2004, compared to 0.8 to 1 at January 3, 2003. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital. In 2003 we sold $281 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare business. We recognized gains on these sales of $64 million in the year ended January 2, 2004. Our ability to continue to sell these timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. Also, we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. In connection with these timeshare note sales, at January 2, 2004, we had repurchase obligations of $19 million related to notes receivable we have sold. We do not expect to incur material losses in respect of those obligations. We retain interests in the notes, which are accounted for as residual interests, and in the year ended January 2, 2004, we received cash flows of $47 million from those retained interests. At January 2, 2004, the special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of $733 million. Investing Activities Cash Flows Acquisitions. We continually seek opportunities to enter new markets, increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions. Dispositions. Property sales generated cash proceeds of $494 million in 2003, $729 million in 2002 and $554 million in 2001. Proceeds in 2003 are net of a $92 million note receivable and closing costs and other items totaling $25 million. In 2003, we closed on the sales of three hotels and 23 senior living communities. We continue to operate all of the hotels under long term operating agreements. Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $210 million in 2003, $292 million in 2002 and $560 million in 2001 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties. Over time, we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development, or to be developed, while continuing to operate them under long term agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets, and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. A summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below. ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Equity investments $ (22 ) $ (26 ) $ (33 ) Investment in corporate owned life insurance (12 ) (11 ) (97 ) Other net cash outflows (5 ) (33 ) (131 ) Cash proceeds on sale of investment in Interval International 63 Sale of affordable housing tax credit investments 82 Other investing outflows $ (39 ) $ (7 ) $ (179 ) Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. We have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business. Loans outstanding, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $996 million at January 2, 2004, $944 million at January 3, 2003, and $860 million at December 28, 2001. Unfunded commitments aggregating $80 million were outstanding at January 2, 2004, of which we expect to fund $44 million in 2004 and $60 million in total. We participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third party ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise. 33 Cash from Financing Activities Debt decreased $319 million in 2003, due to the $200 million repayment, at maturity, of Series A debt in November 2003 and the net pay down of $161 million of commercial paper and other debt. Debt decreased by $945 million in 2002, due to the redemption of 85 percent of the LYONs in May 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility, offset by the debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities in December 2002. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2003, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 7.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.8 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.99 as of January 2, 2004. At January 2, 2004, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. We have $500 million available for future offerings under universal shelf registration statements we have filed with the SEC. In January 2001, we issued, through a private placement, $300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008 and received net proceeds of $297 million. We completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on January 15, 2002. On May 8, 2001, we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021, also known as LYONs, and received cash proceeds of $405 million. On May 9, 2002, we redeemed for cash approximately 85 percent of that issue which the LYONs holders tendered for mandatory repurchase. The remaining LYONs are convertible into approximately 0.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and carry a yield to maturity of 0.75 percent. We may redeem the LYONs on or after May 8, 2004. The holders may also at their option require us to purchase the LYONs at their accreted value on May 8 of each of 2004, 2011 and 2016. We may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash and or shares of our Class A Common Stock. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 2, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Debt $ 1,455 $ 64 $ 508 $ 313 $ 570 Capital lease obligations 11 1 2 1 7 Operating leases Recourse 1,163 105 189 196 673 Non recourse 623 42 94 94 393 Other long term liabilities 70 9 8 8 45 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,322 $ 221 $ 801 $ 612 $ 1,688 The following table summarizes our commitments as of January 2, 2004: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Guarantees $ 1,182 $ 133 $ 354 $ 249 $ 446 Timeshare note repurchase obligations 19 19 Total $ 1,201 $ 133 $ 354 $ 249 $ 465 34 Our guarantees listed above include $238 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of hotels. When we repurchase non performing timeshare loans, we either collect the outstanding loan balance in full or foreclose on the asset and subsequently resell it. Our guarantees include $387 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. Our guarantees also include $47 million of other guarantees associated with the Sunrise sale transaction. As a result of the settlement with Five Star, discussed in Item 3, $41 million of these guarantees included above expired subsequent to January 2, 2004. Our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $80 million at January 2, 2004. We expect to fund $44 million of those commitments within one year and $16 million in one to three years. We do not expect to fund the remaining $20 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $8 million in one to three years; and $12 million after five years. As part of the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 35 Related Party Transactions We have equity method investments in entities that own hotels for which we provide management and or franchise services and we receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Base management fees $ 56 $ 48 $ 48 Incentive management fees 4 4 4 Cost reimbursements 699 557 559 Other income 28 26 28 Total Revenue $ 787 $ 635 $ 639 General, administrative and other $ (11 ) $ (11 ) $ (15 ) Reimbursed costs (699 ) (557 ) (559 ) Interest income 77 66 51 Provision for loan losses (2 ) (5 ) Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Due to equity method investees $ (2 ) $ (1 ) Due from equity method investees 623 532 Share Repurchases. We purchased 10.5 million of our shares in 2003 at an average price of $36.07 per share, 7.8 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of $32.52 per share, and 6.1 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of $38.20 per share. As of January 2, 2004, 13 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In May 2003, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 7 percent to $0.075 per share. Other Matters Inflation. Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Critical Accounting Policies. Certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters. Our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the United States, although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact. We have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. Incentive Fees We recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract. In interim periods, we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. If we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying full year performance thresholds were certain, the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged, but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter. We recognized incentive fee revenue of $109 million, $162 million and $202 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cost Reimbursements We incur certain reimbursable costs on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred, we report cost reimbursements from managed properties and franchisees as revenue, and we report the costs incurred on behalf of managed properties and franchisees as expenses. Cost 36 reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin or mark up. These reimbursed costs relate primarily to payroll costs at domestic properties that we manage, but also include costs associated with certain materials and services. Our financial statements reflect cost reimbursements of $6.2 billion in 2003, $5.7 billion in 2002, and $5.2 billion in 2001. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with FAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by $4 million in 2003, $51 million in 2002 and $16 million in 2001. Our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under FAS No. 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules. Timeshare Sales We also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with FAS No. 66. We recognize sales when (1) we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval, (2) the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired, (3) we deem the receivables to be collectible, and (4) we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects that are attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until we have recognized the sale. Costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. Under this approach, we capitalized selling and marketing costs of approximately $69 million and $107 million at January 2, 2004, and January 3, 2003, respectively, and have included those costs in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a contract is cancelled, we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record forfeited deposits as income. Residual Interests We periodically sell the notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the assets transferred to entities that are accounted for as residual interests. The residual interests are treated as trading or available for sale securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for available for sale securities. We had residual interests of $203 million at January 2, 2004 and $135 million at January 3, 2003, which are recorded as long term receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At January 2, 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $142 million. We have a $61 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, 37 including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, and communicating with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Long Lived Assets We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections. We evaluate the potential impairment of other intangible assets whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. Our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections. We record an impairment loss for goodwill and other intangible assets when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. 38 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or in how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate timeshare and notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals, and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At January 2, 2004, we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. We are required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $726 million, and they expire through 2022. Twenty four forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during fiscal year 2004. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is approximately $37 million, and the forward contracts expire throughout 2004. Two forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets denominated in Pounds Sterling. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $34 million at January 2, 2004. 39 The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of January 2, 2004: Maturities by Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
