Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,632 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments, Full Service Lodging, Select Service Lodging, Extended Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business: (1) selling timeshare intervals, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel joint ventures. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. Lodging supply growth in the United States was low during 2004, while demand growth was high. In the United States, demand was strong in the Eastern and Western regions, while the Midwestern and South Central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand. Demand associated with business travel improved steadily in 2004, and leisure demand remained high. The weak U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies, particularly the euro, resulted in increased travel into the U.S. as overseas trips for many international travelers were less expensive. Conversely, many U.S. vacationers who might have traveled abroad, traveled domestically instead, as the weak dollar made overseas trips more costly. Outside of the U.S. we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. While demand in Latin America and the Caribbean was also good, Europe remains a challenge, as some economies have been slow to rebound. We focus on increasing value for the consumer and selling the way the customer wants to buy. Our Look No Further Best Rate Guarantee, strong Marriott Rewards loyalty program, and information rich, easy to use web site encourage customers to make reservations through Marriott.com. We have complete control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online agents on an as needed basis. The shift of hotel bookings to our web site from other online channels results in higher revenue, margins and profitability. By the end of 2004, we had high speed internet access available in over 2,400 hotels, far outpacing our competition, and we had wireless internet access in lobbies, meeting rooms and public spaces in more than 1,900 hotels. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, January 2, 2004 (which we refer to as 2003), and January 3, 2003 (which we refer to as 2002). Continuing Operations Revenues 2004 Compared to 2003 Revenues increased 12 percent to $10,099 million in 2004, primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion, as well as strong sales in our Timeshare segment. 2003 Compared to 2002 Revenues increased 7 percent to $9,014 million in 2003, reflecting revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us. Operating Income 2004 Compared to 2003 Operating income increased $100 million to $477 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher fees, which are related both to stronger REVPAR, driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate, and to the 20 Table of Contents growth in the number of rooms, and strong timeshare results, which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $84 million in 2004 to $607 million, primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in both our lodging ($55 million) and timeshare businesses ($24 million), primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to the Companys unit growth and increased development costs primarily associated with our Timeshare segment, and a $10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains, offset by $6 million of lower litigation expenses. 2003 Compared to 2002 Operating income increased 17 percent to $377 million in 2003. The favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the $50 million write down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our ExecuStay business, the 2003 receipt of $36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our synthetic fuel operation. In 2003, the synthetic fuel business generated operating losses of $104 million, compared to $134 million in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was hurt by $53 million of lower incentive fees, which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging. General, administrative and other expenses increased $13 million in 2003 to $523 million, reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 (our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003). The expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of $7 million, compared to losses of $6 million in 2002. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, January 2, 2004, and January 3, 2003. ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Timeshare note sale gains $ 64 $ 64 $ 60 Synthetic fuel earn out payments received, net 28 Gains on sales of real estate 44 21 28 Gains on sales of joint venture investments 19 21 44 Other 9 $ 164 $ 106 $ 132 Interest Expense 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest expense decreased $11 million to $99 million, reflecting the repayment of $234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions, partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment. 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest expense increased $24 million to $110 million, reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities, and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment. In the fourth quarter of 2003, $234 million of senior debt was repaid. The weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent. Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased $17 million (13 percent) to $146 million, reflecting higher loan balances, including the $200 million note collected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by Cendant Corporation of our interest in the Two Flags joint venture and higher interest rates. We recognized $9 million of interest income associated with the $200 million note, which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter. Our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of $8 million and includes $3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels, offset by the reversal of $11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes generated a tax provision of $100 million in 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint venture, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $165 million in 2004, compared to $245 million in 2003 and to higher pre tax income. In the third quarter of 2003, we sold a 50 percent interest in our synthetic fuel joint ventures, and we currently consolidate the joint ventures. 21 Table of Contents 2003 Compared to 2002 Interest income increased $7 million (6 percent) to $129 million. Our provision for loan losses for 2003 was $7 million and includes $15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels, offset by the reversal of $8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003, compared to a tax provision of $32 million in 2002. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our synthetic fuel operation, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $245 million in 2003, compared to $208 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of the synthetic fuel operation, our pre tax income was lower in 2003, which also contributed to the favorable tax impact. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 15.7 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business. Minority Interest Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures. Due to the purchasers put option, which expired on November 6, 2003, minority interest for 2003 reflected our partners share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and their share of the associated tax benefit, along with their share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put options expiration date, when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004, (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)) through year end. For additional information, see the discussion relating to our Synthetic Fuel segment on page 31. Income from Continuing Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Income from continuing operations increased 25 percent to $594 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 percent to $2.47. The favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand, new unit growth, strong timeshare results, higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates, lower interest expense due to debt reductions, lower loan loss provisions, stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of $58 million, partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact, and higher general and administrative expenses. 2003 Compared to 2002 Income from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94. Synthetic fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002. Our lodging financial results declined $5 million to $702 million in 2003. The comparisons from 2002 benefit from the $50 million pre tax charge to write down acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay in 2002, offset by the $44 million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International in 2002, and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. Marriott Lodging We consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies.

The results reflect an 18 percent increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $742 million in 2003 to $873 million in 2004, favorable timeshare results and increased gains and joint venture results of $36 million. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher REVPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international occupancy and average daily rate increases and new unit growth. Systemwide REVPAR for comparable North American properties increased 8.5 percent, and REVPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased 8.6 percent. Systemwide REVPAR for comparable international properties, including The Ritz Carlton, increased 14.2 percent, and REVPAR for comparable international company operated properties, including The Ritz Carlton, increased 16.6 percent. The increase in incentive management fees during the year primarily reflects the impact of increased international demand, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, and increased business at properties throughout North America. We have added 166 properties (27,038 rooms) and deflagged 42 properties (7,335 rooms) since year end 2003. Most of the deflagged properties were Fairfield Inns. In addition, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system as a result of the sale of our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand. Worldwide REVPAR for comparable company operated properties increased 10.5 percent, while worldwide REVPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.6 percent. 2003 Compared to 2002 Lodging, which includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay and Timeshare segments, reported financial results of $702 million in 2003, compared to $707 million in 2002, and revenues of $8,712 million in 2003, a 6 percent increase, compared to revenues of $8,222 million in 2002. The 2003 lodging revenue and financial results include the receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost revenues associated with the New York World Trade Center hotel. Our revenues from base management fees totaled $388 million, an increase of 2 percent, reflecting 3 percent growth in the number of managed rooms and a 1.9 percent decline in REVPAR for our North American managed hotels. Incentive management fees were $109 million, a decline of 33 percent, reflecting lower property level house profit. House profit margins declined 2.7 percentage points, largely due to lower average room rates, higher wages, insurance and utility costs, and lower telephone profits, offset by continued productivity improvements. Franchise fees totaled $245 million, an increase of 6 percent. The comparison to 2002 includes the impact of the $50 million pre tax write down of ExecuStay goodwill recorded in 2002, partially offset by a $44 million pre tax gain related to the sale of our investment in Interval International. Lodging Development We opened 144 properties totaling 24,380 rooms, excluding Ramada International, across our brands in 2004, and 42 properties (7,335 rooms) were deflagged and exited the system. In addition, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system as a result of the sale of our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand in 2004. Highlights of the year included: We converted 64 properties (10,565 rooms), or 39 percent of our total room additions for the year, from other brands. We opened over 30 percent of new rooms outside the United States. We added 109 properties (12,859 rooms) to our Select Service and Extended Stay brands. 23 Table of Contents We opened our first Bulgari Hotel & Resort in Milan, Italy, in May 2004. The second property is expected to open in Bali in 2005. We opened three new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Aruba; Phoenix, Arizona; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We currently have more than 55,000 rooms in our development pipeline and expect to add 25,000 to 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2005. We expect to deflag approximately 4,000 rooms during 2005. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See Forward Looking Statements above and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. REVPAR We consider Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate REVPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. The following table shows occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR for each of our comparable principal established brands. We have not presented statistics for company operated North American Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites properties here (or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report) because we operate only a limited number of properties, as both of these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands (identified as nm in the tables below). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. For North American properties (except for The Ritz Carlton, which includes January through December), the occupancy, average daily rate and REVPAR statistics used throughout this report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, include the period from January 3, 2004, through December 31, 2004, while the statistics for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2004, include the period from January 4, 2003, through January 2, 2004. 24 Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties 2004 Change vs. 2003 2004 Change vs. 2003 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (1) Occupancy 72.0 % 2.8 %pts. 70.1 % 2.8 %pts.

The 2004 segment results reflect an $85 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, partially offset by $46 million of increased administrative costs, including costs related to unit growth and development, and the receipt in 2003 of $36 million of insurance proceeds. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger REVPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms. Since year end 2003, across our Full Service Lodging segment, we have added 33 hotels (10,212 rooms), and deflagged six hotels (2,860 rooms) excluding Ramada International. As a result of the sale of our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system in 2004. The ongoing impact of this sale is not expected to be material to the Company. Gains were up $7 million, primarily due to the exercise by Cendant of its option to redeem our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, which generated a gain of $13 million and a note receivable, which was repaid, generating a gain of $5 million. Joint venture results were up $2 million compared to the prior year. For 2003, our equity earnings included $24 million, attributable to our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, while our equity in earnings for 2004 reflects only a $6 million impact due to the redemption of our interest. The improved business environment contributed to the improvement in joint venture results for 2004, offsetting the decline attributable to the Two Flags joint venture. REVPAR for Full Service Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels increased 8.4 percent to $109.62. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 71.3 percent, while average daily rates increased 3.6 percent to $153.66. Demand associated with our international operations was strong across most regions, generating a 16.6 percent REVPAR increase for comparable company operated hotels including The Ritz Carlton. Occupancy increased 6.6 percentage points, while average daily rates increased to $129.35. Financial results increased 37 percent to $140 million, due to stronger demand, particularly in China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Egypt. The European markets generally remain challenging as the economies have been slow to rebound. 2003 Compared to 2002 The 3 percent increase in the Full Service segment results includes the $36 million insurance payment received for lost management fees in connection with the loss of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 2003 results also reflect an $18 million increase in base management and franchise fees, largely due to the growth in the number of rooms. Across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 88 hotels (18,442 rooms) and deflagged 15 hotels (3,152 rooms). We typically earn incentive fees only after a managed hotel achieves a minimum level of owner profitability. As a result, lower revenue and lower property level margins have reduced the number of hotels from which we earn incentive management fees. As a result, full service incentive fees declined $41 million in 2003. REVPAR for Full Service Lodging North American systemwide hotels declined 1.6 percent to $90.57. Occupancy for these hotels was flat at 67.1 percent, while average daily rates declined 1.6 percent to $134.92. Financial results for our international operations increased 9 percent to $102 million, reflecting $21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an $8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in Istanbul, a $7 million charge to write down our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in January 2004, and the impact of the war and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on international travel earlier in the year. REVPAR for our international systemwide hotels declined 2.4 percent. Occupancy declined 1.4 percentage points, while average daily rates remained relatively flat at $117.54. 29 Table of Contents Select Service Lodging ($ in millions) Annual Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Revenues $ 1,118 $ 1,000 $ 967 12 % 3 % Segment results $ 140 $ 99 $ 130 41 % 24 % 2004 Compared to 2003 Select Service Lodging includes our Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands. The increase in revenues over the prior year reflects stronger REVPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms across our select service brands. Base management, incentive management and franchise fees increased $31 million, and gains were $19 million higher than the prior year, reflecting land sales during the year as well as recognition of deferred gains associated with properties we previously owned. Joint venture results increased by $5 million as a result of the strong business environment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of $13 million. Most of the increase in administrative costs is associated with a transaction related to our Courtyard joint venture (discussed more fully below in Liquidity and Capital Resources under the heading Courtyard Joint Venture). We expect to enter into a new long term management agreement with the joint venture in early 2005. As the termination of the existing management agreement is probable, in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs related to the existing contract, resulting in a charge of $13 million. Across our Select Service Lodging segment, we have added 89 hotels (10,556 rooms) and deflagged 35 hotels (4,395 rooms) since year end 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002 The $31 million decrease in the Select Service Lodging segment results reflects the impact of a $9 million reduction in base management, incentive management and franchise fees. The results also include $14 million of higher equity losses, primarily from our Courtyard joint venture, formed in 2000, which owns 120 Courtyard hotels. In 2003, across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,054 rooms) and deflagged four hotels (731 rooms). Over 90 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. Extended Stay Lodging ($ in millions) Annual Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Revenues $ 547 $ 557 $ 600 2 % 7 % Segment results $ 66 $ 47 $ (3 ) 40 % nm 2004 Compared to 2003 Extended Stay Lodging includes our Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands. The decline in revenue is primarily attributable to the shift in the ExecuStay business from management to franchising. We entered into more than 20 new franchise markets in 2004, and only five managed markets remain at the end of 2004. Our base management fees increased $4 million, and our incentive management fees were essentially flat with last year, while our franchise fees, principally associated with our Residence Inn brand, increased $9 million. The increase in franchise fees is largely due to the growth in the number of rooms and an increase in REVPAR. Since year end 2003, we have added 20 hotels (2,303 rooms) and deflagged one hotel (80 rooms) across our Extended Stay segment. In addition, gains of $10 million in 2004 were favorable to the prior year by $4 million. ExecuStay experienced improved results compared to the prior year, resulting from increased occupancy, primarily in the New York market, coupled with lower operating costs associated with the shift in business towards franchising. The $2 million increase in general and administrative costs associated with supporting the segments hotel brands was more than offset by the $6 million decline in ExecuStays general and administrative costs associated with the shift toward franchising. REVPAR for Select Service and Extended Stay Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels increased 9.1 percent to $68.66. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 72.6 percent from 70.0 percent in 2003, while average daily rates increased 4.4 percent to $94.52. 2003 Compared to 2002 In 2002, we recorded a $50 million charge in our Extended Stay Lodging segment to write down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay. Our base and incentive management fees decreased $7 million and our franchise fees increased $6 million. In 2003, we added 31 hotels (3,837 rooms) across our Extended Stay Lodging segment. Over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised. We deflagged one property (104 rooms), and we decreased our ExecuStay brand by 1,300 units. 30 Table of Contents REVPAR for Select Service and Extended Stay Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels decreased 2.2 percent to $63.64. Occupancy for these hotels decreased to 70.0 percent, while average daily rates decreased 1.1 percent to $90.98. Timeshare ($ in millions) Annual Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Revenues $ 1,502 $ 1,279 $ 1,147 17 % 12 % Segment results $ 203 $ 149 $ 183 36 % 19 % 2004 Compared to 2003 Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz Carlton Club, Marriott Grand Residence Club and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club International brands. Timeshare revenues of $1,502 million and $1,279 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively, include interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. Including our three joint ventures, contract sales, which represent sales of timeshare intervals before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting, increased 31 percent, primarily due to strong demand in South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, California, St. Thomas and Aruba. The favorable segment results reflect a 9 percent increase in timeshare interval sales and services, higher margins, primarily resulting from lower marketing and selling costs, and the mix of units sold, partially offset by $24 million of higher administrative expenses. Our note sales gain of $64 million was flat compared to the prior year. In addition, we adjusted the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our residual interests due to current trends in interest rates and recorded a $7 million charge in 2004. Reported revenue growth trailed contract sales growth because of a higher proportion of sales in joint venture projects and projects with lower average construction completion. 2003 Compared to 2002 Our Timeshare segment results decreased 19 percent to $149 million, while revenues increased 12 percent. Note sale gains in 2003 were $64 million compared to $60 million in 2002. Contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and South Carolina and soft in Lake Tahoe, Orlando and Williamsburg. The comparison to 2002 reflects the $44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in Interval International. Timeshare revenues of $1,279 million and $1,147 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively, includes interval sales, base management fees and cost reimbursements. Synthetic Fuel For 2004, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $321 million and income from continuing operations of $107 million, comprised of: operating losses of $98 million; and equity losses of $28 million (which included net earn out payments made of $6 million); entirely offset by net earn out payments received of $28 million; a $21 million tax benefit; tax credits which amounted to $144 million; and a minority interest benefit of $40 million reflecting our partners share of the operating losses. For 2003, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $302 million and income from continuing operations of $96 million, comprised of: operating losses of $104 million (which included net earn out payments made of $14 million); minority interest expense of $55 million, reflecting our partners share of the tax credits, tax benefits, and operating losses; entirely offset by equity income of $10 million; a $34 million tax benefit; and tax credits which amounted to $211 million. The $11 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to the synthetic fuel operation to $107 million from $96 million is primarily due to slightly higher production in 2004. In July 2004, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a Summary Report to PacifiCorp, the previous owner of the synthetic fuel facilities, that included a challenge to the placed in service dates of three of the four synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of our synthetic fuel joint ventures. One of the conditions to qualify for tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code is that the production facility must have been placed in service before July 1, 1998. We strongly believe that all the facilities meet the placed in service requirement. Although we are engaged in discussions with the IRS and are confident this issue will be resolved in our favor and not result in a material charge to us, we cannot assure you as to the ultimate outcome of this matter. If ultimately resolved against us we could be prevented from realizing projected future tax credits and cause us to reverse previously utilized tax credits, requiring payment of substantial additional taxes. Since acquiring the plants, we have recognized approximately $435 million of tax credits from all four plants through December 31, 2004. The tax credits recognized through December 31, 2004, associated with the three facilities in question totaled approximately $330 million. 31 Table of Contents On October 6, 2004, we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that result in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us. On the synthetic fuel facility that is not being reviewed by the IRS, our partner increased its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through March 31, 2005, and pays a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits. With respect to the three synthetic fuel facilities under IRS review, our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to an average of roughly 5 percent through March 31, 2005. If the IRS placed in service challenge regarding the three facilities is not successfully resolved by March 31, 2005, our partner will have the right to return its ownership interest in those three facilities to us at that time. We will have the flexibility to continue to operate at current levels, reduce production and or sell an interest to another party. If there is a successful resolution by March 31, 2005, our partners share of the tax credits from all four facilities will return to approximately 50 percent. In any event, on March 31, 2005, our share of the tax credits from the one facility not under review will return to approximately 50 percent. Impact of Future Adoption of Accounting Standards Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time sharing Transactions In December 2004, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time sharing Transactions, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to exclude accounting for real estate time sharing transactions from these statements. The SOP will be effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Under the SOP, the majority of the costs incurred to sell timeshares will be charged to expense when incurred. In regards to notes receivable issued in conjunction with a sale, an estimate of uncollectibility that is expected to occur must be recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that profit is recognized on a timeshare sale. Rental and other operations during holding periods must be accounted for as incidental operations, which require that any excess costs be recorded as a reduction of inventory costs. We estimate that the initial adoption of the SOP, which will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our Fiscal Year 2006 financial statements, will result in a non cash one time pre tax charge of approximately $150 million, consisting primarily of the write off of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserve on notes. We estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption will not be significant. FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS No. 123R), which is a revision of FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. FAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We will adopt FAS No. 123R at the beginning of our 2005 third quarter. FAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values. The grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using an option pricing model adjusted for any unique characteristics of a particular instrument. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. We estimate that adoption of FAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective method, will result in incremental pre tax expense in fiscal year 2005 of approximately $20 million, based on our current share based payment compensation plans and a mid year adoption. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services On December 30, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to Sunrise and to sell nine senior living communities to CNL. We recorded after tax charges of $131 million in 2002 associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business. We completed the sales to Sunrise and CNL and a related sale of a parcel of land to Sunrise in March 2003 for $266 million. We recorded after tax gains of $19 million in 2003. 32 Table of Contents Distribution Services In the third quarter of 2002, we completed a previously announced strategic review of our Distribution Services business and decided to exit that business. We completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities, closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements. We recorded after tax charges of $40 million in 2002 in connection with the decision to exit this business. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of up to $2 billion, expiring in 2006 ($1.5 billion expiring in July and $500 million expiring in August), which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, we had no loans outstanding under these facilities. Fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on our public debt rating. At December 31, 2004, our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately $2.7 billion. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements, including the repayment of our Series D senior notes totaling $275 million and our Series B senior notes totaling $200 million, both of which mature in 2005. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Cash from operations $ 891 $ 403 $ 516 Depreciation expense 133 132 145 Amortization expense 33 28 42 While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts. We include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare business (which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business, as that number is a component of income from continuing operations): ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ 93 $ (94 ) $ (102 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (459 ) (247 ) (218 ) Loan repurchases (18 ) (19 ) (16 ) Note sale gains (64 ) (64 ) (60 ) Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 129 (4 ) (13 ) Note sale proceeds 312 231 341 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 94 50 31 Other cash inflows (outflows) 26 36 (26 ) Net cash inflows (outflows) from timeshare activity $ 113 $ (111 ) $ (63 ) Our ability to sell timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. We might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. 33 Table of Contents Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.8 to 1 at both December 31, 2004, and January 2, 2004. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $181 million in 2004, $210 million in 2003 and $292 million in 2002 primarily included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvement to existing properties and systems initiatives. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development, subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $402 million in 2004, $494 million in 2003 and $729 million in 2002. In 2004, we closed on the sales of two hotels, and we continue to operate both of the hotels under long term management agreements. We also disposed of 30 land parcels, our Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand, our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, two other minority interests in joint ventures and other miscellaneous assets. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. We have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business. Loan collections, net of advances during 2004, amounted to $147 million. Loans outstanding, excluding timeshare notes, totaled $942 million at December 31, 2004, $996 million at January 2, 2004, and $944 million at January 3, 2003. Unfunded commitments aggregating $42 million were outstanding at December 31, 2004, of which we expect to fund $12 million in 2005 and $26 million in total. Other Investing Activities A summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below. ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Equity investments $ (75 ) $ (22 ) $ (26 ) Investment in corporate owned life insurance (8 ) (12 ) (11 ) Other net cash inflows (outflows) 2 22 (33 ) Cash proceeds on sale of investment in Interval International 63 Other investing outflows $ (81 ) $ (12 ) $ (7 ) Cash from Financing Activities Debt Debt decreased $130 million in 2004, from $1,455 million to $1,325 million, due to the repurchase of all of our remaining zero coupon convertible senior Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021, also known as LYONs (the LYONs) totaling $62 million, the maturity of $46 million of senior notes and other debt reductions of $22 million. Debt decreased by $319 million in 2003, due to the $200 million repayment, at maturity, of Series A debt in November 2003 and the net pay down of $161 million of commercial paper and other debt. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2004, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 7.5 percent and an average maturity of approximately 2.5 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was slightly lower than one as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. 34 Table of Contents We have $500 million available for future offerings under universal shelf registration statements we have filed with the SEC. Share Repurchases. We purchased 14.0 million of our shares in 2004 at an average price of $46.65 per share, 10.5 million of our shares in 2003 at an average price of $36.07 per share, and 7.8 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of $32.52 per share. As of December 31, 2004, 18.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In May 2004, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 13 percent to $0.085 per share. Pending Transaction Courtyard Joint Venture In December 2004, we and Host Marriott announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement by which an institutional investor would obtain a 75 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture. We expect the transaction, which is subject to certain closing conditions, to close in early 2005, although we cannot assure you that the sale will be completed. Currently, we and Host Marriott own equal shares in the 120 property joint venture, and with the addition of the new equity, our percentage interest in the joint venture will decline from 50 percent to 21 percent. As a result of the transaction, the pace of the Courtyard hotel reinventions, a program that renovates and upgrades Courtyard hotels, will be accelerated. Upon closing of the transaction: We expect that our existing mezzanine loan to the joint venture (including accrued interest) totaling approximately $249 million at December 31, 2004, will be repaid; We expect to make available to the joint venture a seven year subordinated loan of approximately $144 million to be funded as reinventions are completed in 2005 and 2006; We expect to enter into a new long term management agreement with the joint venture. As the termination of the existing management agreement is probable, we have written off our deferred contract costs related to the existing contract in the 2004 fourth quarter, resulting in a charge of $13 million; and Upon closing of the transaction, we expect to record a gain associated with the repayment of the mezzanine loan, which will be substantially offset by our portion of the joint ventures costs of prepaying an existing senior loan. On an ongoing basis, we expect our interest income will decline as a result of the repayment of the mezzanine loan, and we expect lower book losses from the joint venture due to the reduction of our equity interest and improved performance at the hotels. On a long term basis, we expect that the Courtyard reinventions will promote continued growth and maintain and enhance customer preference. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Debt 1 $ 1,723 $ 575 $ 147 $ 702 $ 299 Capital lease obligations 1 16 1 2 2 11 Operating leases Recourse 1,035 93 195 205 542 Non recourse 544 28 38 31 447 Other long term liabilities 56 6 6 44 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,374 $ 697 $ 388 $ 946 $ 1,343 1 Includes principal as well as interest payments. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our commitments as of December 31, 2004: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total guarantees where Marriott International is the primary obligor $ 601 $ 64 $ 203 $ 121 $ 213 Total guarantees where Marriott International is secondarily liable 1,909 108 209 211 1,381 Total other commercial commitments $ 2,510 $ 172 $ 412 $ 332 $ 1,594 Our guarantees listed above include $91 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of hotels. The guarantees above include $349 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under these guarantees. The guarantees above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $63 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available extensions of approximately $1.56 billion. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted above, as of December 31, 2004, our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $42 million at December 31, 2004. We expect to fund $12 million of those commitments within one year and $14 million in the following year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $16 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $14 million within one year and $2 million after five years. At December 31, 2004, we also have commitments to invest $37 million of equity for a minority interest in two partnerships, which plan to purchase both full service and select service hotels in the United States. At December 31, 2004, we also had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of December 31, 2004, totaled $486 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and self insurance programs. As part of the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 36 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Base management fees $ 72 $ 56 $ 48 Incentive management fees 8 4 4 Cost reimbursements 802 699 557 Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue 29 28 26 Total revenue $ 911 $ 787 $ 635 General, administrative and other $ (33 ) $ (11 ) $ (11 ) Reimbursed costs (802 ) (699 ) (557 ) Gains and other income 19 21 44 Interest income 74 77 66 Reversal of (provision for) loan losses 3 (2 ) (5 ) Equity in earnings (losses) Synthetic fuel (28 ) (10 ) Equity in earnings (losses) Other (14 ) (17 ) (6 ) Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2004 2003 Current assets accounts and notes receivable $ 72 $ 118 Contract acquisition costs 24 42 Equity method investments 249 468 Loans to equity method investees 526 558 Other long term receivables 3 Other long term assets 38 30 Current liabilities: Accounts payable (3 ) (2 ) Other payables and accruals (4 ) (1 ) Other long term liabilities (11 ) (10 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare intervals, and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. 37 Table of Contents Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred, and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, which assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At December 31, 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $181 million. We have a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $89 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Audit Services Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y), recently notified the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors that certain non audit services E&Y performed in China and Japan for a large number of public companies, including Marriott, have raised questions regarding E&Ys independence in its performance of audit services. With respect to Marriott, from 2001 through 2004, E&Y performed tax calculation and preparation services for Marriott employees located in China and Japan, and affiliates of E&Y made payment of the relevant taxes on behalf of Marriott. The payment of those taxes involved handling of Company related funds, which is not permitted under SEC auditor independence rules. These actions by affiliates of E&Y have been discontinued, and both the amount of the taxes and the fees paid to E&Y in connection with these services are de minimis. The Audit Committee and E&Y discussed E&Ys independence with respect to the Company in light of the foregoing facts. E&Y informed the Audit Committee that it does not believe that the holding and paying of those funds impaired E&Ys independence with respect to the Company. The Company, based on its own review, also is 38 Table of Contents not aware of any additional non audit services that may compromise E&Ys independence in performing audit services for the Company. Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or in how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate timeshare and notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals, and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At December 31, 2004, we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. We are required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $535 million, and they expire through 2022. Forward foreign exchange and option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during fiscal year 2005. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts is approximately $36 million, and they expire throughout 2005. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets denominated in pounds sterling. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $36 million at December 31, 2004. 40 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: ($ in millions) Maturities by Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
