Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,741 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: Full Service Lodging, Select Service Lodging, Extended Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 67 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare intervals and personal residences, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Similar to conditions that existed last year, lodging supply growth in the United States was low during 2005, while demand growth was high. As a result, both occupancies and average daily rates continued to rise. Transient demand, both business and leisure, was strong in 2005, and we experienced particularly robust pricing power associated with that demand. In addition, our group rates are continuing to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is being replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. In the United States, demand was strongest in the Eastern and Western regions, while the Midwestern and South Central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand. Demand was also strong in Hawaii. The weak U.S. dollar, in relation to other currencies, helped increase travel, versus the prior year, into the United States. In addition, we saw increased demand associated with U.S. vacationers who were also impacted by the weak U.S. dollar and traveled domestically instead of abroad. Outside of the United States we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year, particularly in China, Hong Kong, the Middle East, Mexico and the Caribbean. Demand in Europe and South American countries continues to remain less robust, as some economies continue to emerge from a slowdown. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report for important information regarding forward looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Continuing Operations Revenues 2005 Compared to 2004 Revenues increased 14 percent to $11,550 million in 2005 from $10,099 million in 2004, as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Year over year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement. The increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. Higher timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues. In addition, revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. Further, owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed properties (see the CTF Holdings Ltd. discussion later in this report under the Acquisitions caption in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section). 25 Table of Contents The 14 percent increase in total revenue includes $743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,671 million in 2005 from $6,928 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added mark up, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 45 managed properties (4,519 rooms) to our system in 2005 (including the Whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section). 2004 Compared to 2003 Revenues increased 12 percent to $10,099 million in 2004 from $9,014 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion, as well as higher timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue. Operating Income 2005 Compared to 2004 Operating income increased $78 million to $555 million in 2005 from $477 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the following items: a combined base, incentive and franchise fee improvement of $154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment; $51 million of stronger timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue; and $65 million of stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses. The fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, including the CTF properties, the strong demand environment in 2005, and our receipt in 2005, of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. The favorable items noted above were partially offset by $146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and $46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses. Increased general and administrative expenses were associated with our Lodging segments as unallocated general and administrative expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflects a $94 million pre tax charge impacting our Full Service Lodging segment, primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements (discussed more fully later in this report in the CTF Holdings Ltd. discussion under the Investing Activities Cash Flows caption in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section), and $30 million of pre tax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, impacting our Full Service, Select Service and Extended Stay Lodging segments. We implemented the bedding incentive program in 2005 to ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year end 2005. General and administrative expenses in 2005 also reflect pre tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties, a $9 million pre tax charge associated with three guarantees, increased other net overhead costs of $13 million including costs related to the Companys unit growth, development and systems, and $2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by $5 million of lower litigation expenses. Additionally, in 2004, general and administrative expenses included a $13 million charge associated with the write off of deferred contract acquisition costs. Operating income for 2005 includes a synthetic fuel operating loss of $144 million versus $98 million of operating losses in the prior year, reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. For additional information, see our Synthetic Fuel segment discussion later in this report. 2004 Compared to 2003 Operating income increased $100 million to $477 million in 2004 from $377 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher fees, which are related both to stronger RevPAR, driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate, and to the growth in the number of rooms, and strong timeshare results, which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $84 million in 2004 to $607 million from $523 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in our Full Service, Select Service, and Extended Stay segments ($55 million) and Timeshare segment ($24 million), primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to 26 Table of Contents the Companys unit growth and timeshare development, and a $10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains, offset by $6 million of lower litigation expenses. Higher general and administrative expenses of $84 million also reflect a $13 million write off of deferred contract acquisition costs as further discussed in the 2004 Compared to 2003 caption under the Select Service Lodging heading later in this report. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for 2005, 2004, and 2003. ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Timeshare note sale gains $ 69 $ 64 $ 64 Gains on sales of joint venture investments 7 19 21 Synthetic fuel earn out payments received, net 32 28 Gains on sales of real estate and other 34 48 21 Other note sale/repayment gains 25 5 Income from cost method joint ventures 14 $ 181 $ 164 $ 106 Interest Expense 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest expense increased $7 million (7 percent) to $106 million in 2005 from $99 million in the prior year, reflecting increased debt levels which helped to facilitate significantly higher capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2005. Interest expense in 2005 reflected our June 2005 Series F Senior Notes issuance, and, versus the prior year, higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Included within interest expense for 2005 are charges totaling $29 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows from owners, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners behalf, including the Marriott Rewards, Gift Certificates, and Self Insurance programs. The increase over 2004 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Senior Notes in April 2005 and Series B Senior Notes in November 2005 and the capitalization of more interest associated with the development of timeshare properties. 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest expense decreased $11 million to $99 million in 2004 from $110 million in the prior year, reflecting the repayment of $234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions, partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment. Included within interest expense for 2004 and 2003 are charges totaling $11 million and $8 million, respectively, associated with programs operated on behalf of owners as described above. Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased $67 million (46 percent) to $79 million in 2005 from $146 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us. The repayments are described more fully under the Loan Activity caption in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section later in this report. Our provision for loan losses increased $36 million versus the prior year reflecting an $11 million charge in 2005 associated with one property and a pre tax charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta Air Lines, Inc. aircraft leveraged lease, as discussed more fully under the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section later in this report. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax provision of $94 million for 2005, compared to a tax provision of $100 million for 2004. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint ventures, which generated a net tax benefit of $190 million in 2005, compared to a net tax benefit of $165 million in 2004, and to a lower tax rate before the impact of the Synthetic Fuel segment in 2005, as a result of a higher proportion of income in countries with lower effective tax rates. Higher taxes associated with higher pre tax income in 2005 partially offset these favorable tax impacts. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. 27 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased $17 million (13 percent) to $146 million in 2004 from $129 million in the prior year, reflecting higher loan balances, including the $200 million note collected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by Cendant Corporation of our interest in the Two Flags joint venture and higher interest rates. We recognized $9 million of interest income associated with the $200 million note, which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter. Our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of $8 million and includes $3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels, offset by the reversal of $11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax provision of $100 million in 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003. The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint venture, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $165 million in 2004, compared to $245 million in 2003 and to higher pre tax income. For additional information see the analysis of our results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2005 Compared to 2004 Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees increased $78 million from a net loss of $42 million in 2004 to net earnings of $36 million in 2005. Twenty eight million dollars of the increase is attributable to our synthetic fuel joint ventures which we reported as an equity investment in the 2004 first quarter, versus consolidation of the joint ventures for the periods thereafter. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. The remaining $50 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to significant 2005 asset sale gains in several joint ventures producing higher earnings from joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, the stronger 2005 lodging demand environment and the mix of investments in each year. 2004 Compared to 2003 Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees decreased to a net loss of $42 million in 2004 from a net loss of $7 million in 2003. In 2003, we recognized equity earnings of $24 million associated with our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, while in 2004 we only recognized $6 million of equity earnings due to the redemption of our interest. In addition, we had equity income from our synthetic fuel joint ventures of $10 million in 2003 compared to equity losses of $28 million in 2004. The improved business environment in 2004 and the mix of investments versus the prior year favorably impacted our equity income by $21 million, partially offsetting the aforementioned negative variances. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. Minority Interest 2005 Compared to 2004 Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $45 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year end. For 2005, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year. As further described in the Synthetic Fuel caption in Part I, Item 1 Business. On the first day of our 2006 fiscal year, we redeemed our partners interest in SAFE II. Accordingly, in 2006, minority interest will only represent our partners share of the losses in SAFE I. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. 2004 Compared to 2003 Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the impact of a change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. Due to the purchasers put option, which expired on November 6, 2003, minority interest for 2003 reflected our partners share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit, along with its share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put options expiration date, when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year end. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. 28 Table of Contents Income from Continuing Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 Income from continuing operations increased $74 million (12 percent) to $668 million in 2005 versus the prior year, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.42 (17 percent) to $2.89. As discussed above in more detail, the increase in income from continuing operations from the prior year is primarily due to the strong demand environment, increased owned, leased and corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses (principally reflecting owned and leased properties acquired in the 2005 third quarter), increased timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, stronger equity income, higher gains and other income, and lower taxes. As discussed above in more detail, increased general and administrative expenses reflecting, among other things, the write off of deferred contract acquisition costs in connection with the CTF transaction and expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses, lower interest income, higher interest expense, and a higher loan loss provision partially offset these favorable items. 2004 Compared to 2003 Income from continuing operations increased $118 million (25 percent) to $594 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.53 (27 percent) to $2.47. The favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand, new unit growth, strong timeshare results, higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates, lower interest expense due to debt reductions, lower loan loss provisions, stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of $58 million, partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact, and higher general and administrative expenses. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: Full Service, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, The Ritz Carlton, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts; Select Service, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites; Extended Stay, which includes Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott ExecuStay and Marriott Executive Apartments; Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation and sale of timeshare, fractional, and whole ownership properties under the Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands; and Synthetic Fuel, which includes our interest in the operation of coal based synthetic fuel production facilities. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest income, provision for loan losses, and interest expense. With the exception of the Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains as well as equity in earnings (losses) from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Unallocated corporate expenses represent that portion of our general, administrative and other expenses and equity in earnings (losses) that are not allocable to our segments. We have aggregated the brands and businesses presented within each of our segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels and the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment. 29 Table of Contents Revenues ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Full Service $ 7,535 $ 6,611 $ 5,876 Select Service 1,265 1,118 1,000 Extended Stay 608 547 557 Timeshare 1,721 1,502 1,279 Total Lodging 11,129 9,778 8,712 Synthetic Fuel 421 321 302 $ 11,550 $ 10,099 $ 9,014 Income from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Full Service $ 474 $ 426 $ 407 Select Service 209 140 99 Extended Stay 65 66 47 Timeshare 271 203 149 Total Lodging financial results 1,019 835 702 Synthetic Fuel (after tax) 125 107 96 Unallocated corporate expenses (137 ) (138 ) (132 ) Interest income, provision for loan losses and interest expense (55 ) 55 12 Income taxes (excluding Synthetic Fuel) (284 ) (265 ) (202 ) $ 668 $ 594 $ 476 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Full Service $ 39 $ 10 $ 8 Select Service (5 ) (17 ) (22 ) Timeshare 1 (7 ) (4 ) Synthetic Fuel (28 ) 10 Corporate 1 1 $ 36 $ (42 ) $ (7 ) Marriott Lodging Lodging includes our Full Service, Select Service, Extended Stay and Timeshare segments. We consider Lodging revenues and Lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We added 134 properties (21,611 rooms) and deflagged 25 properties (4,755 rooms) in 2005. Most of the deflagged properties were Fairfield Inn properties. 30 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Lodging reported financial results of $1,019 million in 2005, compared to $835 million in 2004, and revenues of $11,129 million in 2005, a 14 percent increase from revenues of $9,778 million in 2004. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $154 million (18 percent) increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $873 million in 2004 to $1,027 million in 2005, stronger timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses, improved equity income and higher gains. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international rate increases and new unit growth. Incentive management fees increased $59 million (42 percent) in 2005 versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of increased travel worldwide driving strong property level profits. The increase also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. In 2005, 50 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 32 percent in 2004. Increased general and administrative expenses of $146 million, as discussed in the earlier Operating Income discussion, partially offset these improvements. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased 9.5 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased 9.8 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased 11.9 percent and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased 11.0 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased 10.1 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.9 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable managed property level house profit margins increased 180 basis points. 2004 Compared to 2003 We added 166 properties (27,038 rooms) and deflagged 42 properties (7,335 rooms) from year end 2003 to year end 2004. Most of the deflagged properties were Fairfield Inn properties. In addition, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system as a result of the sale of the Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand. Lodging reported financial results of $835 million in 2004, compared to $702 million in 2003, and revenues of $9,778 million in 2004, a 12 percent increase from revenues of $8,712 million in 2003. The results reflect a $131 million (18 percent) increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $742 million in 2003 to $873 million in 2004, favorable Timeshare segment results and increased gains and joint venture results of $36 million. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international occupancy and average daily rate increases and new unit growth. In 2004, 32 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 29 percent in the prior year. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased 8.5 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased 8.6 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased 14.2 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased 16.6 percent. The increase in incentive management fees during the year primarily reflects the impact of increased international demand, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, and increased business at properties throughout North America. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased 10.5 percent, while worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.6 percent. Lodging Development We opened 134 properties totaling 21,611 rooms, across our brands in 2005, and 25 properties (4,755 rooms), predominantly Fairfield Inn properties, were deflagged and exited the system. Highlights of the year included: We converted 33 properties (5,846 rooms), or 27 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands. We opened over 20 percent of new rooms outside the United States. We added 103 properties (12,656 rooms) to our Select Service and Extended Stay brands. We opened two new Marriott Vacation Club International properties in Hilton Head, South Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada. 31 Table of Contents We currently have more than 70,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our development pipeline, and we expect to add approximately 25,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2006. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report. RevPAR The following tables show, for 2005 and 2004, occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR for each of our comparable North American principal established brands and for our international properties by either region or brand. We have not presented statistics for company operated North American Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as this brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. For North American properties the occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2005 include the period from January 1, 2005 through December 30, 2005, the statistics for 2004 include the period from January 3, 2004 through December 31, 2004, and the statistics for 2003 include the period from January 4, 2003 through January 2, 2004 (except in each case, for The Ritz Carlton and International properties, which includes the period from January 1 through December 31). 32 Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties 2005 Change vs. 2004 2005 Change vs. 2004 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (1) Occupancy 73.2 % 1.0 % pts. 71.0 % 1.2 % pts.

As discussed more fully earlier in this report in Part I, under the Ramada International caption in the Item 1 Business section, we sold Ramada International in 2004. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 7,535 $ 6,611 $ 5,876 14% 13% Segment results $ 474 $ 426 $ 407 11% 5% 2005 Compared to 2004 In 2005, across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 30 hotels (8,326 rooms) and deflagged seven hotels (2,446 rooms). Compared to the prior year, our 2005 segment results reflect a $91 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees and $73 million of increased owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, which includes a $10 million termination fee payment to us associated with one property that left our system, partially offset by $6 million of severance payments and other costs associated with the temporary closing of a leased property undergoing renovation. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases which favorably impact property level house profits, the growth in the number of rooms and the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, all of which we expect to sell in 2006, including the CTF properties. Further impacting segment results, gains and other income was $5 million higher than the prior year, while equity results increased by $29 million versus the prior year. The increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to the following items: $9 million of higher gains in 2005 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties; $11 million of increased income in 2005 associated with cost method investments, partially offset by the $13 million gain in 2004 associated with the sale of our interest in the Two Flags Joint Venture. The increase in equity results is primarily attributable to several joint ventures which had significant asset sales in 2005 generating gains, and to a lesser extent, the favorable variance is also a result of a stronger demand environment and the mix of investments. The increase in income associated with cost method investments is primarily related to one new investment in 2005. RevPAR for Full Service Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels increased 10.0 percent to $121.27. Occupancy for these hotels increased 1.4 percentage points while average daily rates increased 7.8 percent to $166.58. Somewhat offsetting the net favorable variances noted above were $151 million of higher general and administrative costs. As noted in the preceding Operating Income discussion, during 2005 we recorded a $94 million pre tax charge, primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of CTF management agreements, and we incurred pre tax expenses of $18 million related to our bedding incentive program, both of which impacted our general and administrative expenses. In 2005, we also recorded pre tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties and $6 million of pre tax charges associated with two guarantees, which impacted general and administrative expenses. In addition, in 2005 there were increased overhead costs associated with unit growth and development. Financial results for our international operations were strong across most regions. Increased demand in 2005 generated an 11.0 percent RevPAR increase for comparable company operated hotels over 2004. Additionally, occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points, while average daily rates increased to $137.62. In 2005 we experienced strong demand particularly in China, Mexico, the Caribbean and Egypt. The European markets generally continue to remain less robust. 37 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 During 2004, across our Full Service Lodging segment, we added 33 hotels (10,212 rooms), and deflagged six hotels (2,860 rooms) excluding Ramada International. As a result of the sale of the Ramada International Hotels & Resorts franchised brand, 210 properties (28,081 rooms) exited our system in 2004. The ongoing impact of this sale has not been material to the Company. The 2004 segment results reflect an $85 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, partially offset by $46 million of increased administrative costs, including costs related to unit growth and development, and the receipt in 2003 of $36 million of insurance proceeds. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms. Gains were up $7 million, primarily due to the exercise by Cendant of its option to redeem our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, which generated a gain of $13 million, and a note receivable, which was repaid, generating a gain of $5 million. Joint venture results were up $2 million compared to the prior year. For 2003, our equity earnings included $24 million, attributable to our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, while our equity in earnings for 2004 reflects only a $6 million impact due to the redemption of our interest. The improved business environment contributed to the improvement in joint venture results for 2004, offsetting the decline attributable to the Two Flags joint venture. RevPAR for Full Service Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels increased 8.4 percent to $109.62. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 71.3 percent, while average daily rates increased 3.6 percent to $153.66. Demand associated with our international operations was strong across most regions, generating a 16.6 percent RevPAR increase for comparable company operated hotels. Occupancy increased 6.6 percentage points, while average daily rates increased to $129.35. Financial results increased 37 percent to $140 million, due to stronger demand, particularly in China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Egypt. The European markets generally remain challenging as the economies have been slow to rebound. Select Service Lodging includes our Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 1,265 $ 1,118 $ 1,000 13% 12% Segment results $ 209 $ 140 $ 99 49% 41% 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 66 hotels (8,363 rooms) and deflagged 18 hotels (2,309 rooms) in 2005. The deflagged properties were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our select service brands. The $69 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $35 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $4 million of higher owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, $12 million of higher gains and other income, a $12 million increase in equity results, and $6 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 included $8 million of higher pre tax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program. In 2004, as discussed below, we wrote off deferred contract acquisition costs, impacting general and administrative expenses, totaling $13 million. The 2005 increase in gains and other income is primarily a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, which generated pre tax gains of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard joint venture and increased income of $3 million in 2005 associated with cost method joint ventures, partially offset by $20 million of gains in 2004 primarily associated with land sales. Stronger performance at our reinvented Courtyard properties, versus non reinvented properties, is also contributing to the increase in revenue and segment results from the prior year. For additional information related to the Courtyard joint venture, see the Courtyard Joint Venture caption in Liquidity and Capital Resources later in this report. 38 Table of Contents 2004 Compared to 2003 Across our Select Service Lodging segment, we added 89 hotels (10,556 rooms) and deflagged 35 hotels (4,395 rooms) in 2004. The increase in the Select Service Lodging segment revenues for 2004 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases, and the growth in the number of rooms across our select service brands. Base management, incentive management and franchise fees increased $31 million, and gains were $19 million higher than the prior year, reflecting land sales during the year as well as recognition of deferred gains associated with properties we previously owned. Joint venture results increased by $5 million as a result of the strong business environment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of $13 million. Most of the increase in administrative costs is associated with a transaction related to our Courtyard joint venture (discussed more fully later in this report in Liquidity and Capital Resources under the heading Courtyard Joint Venture). As the termination of the existing management agreements associated with the Courtyard joint venture was probable in 2004, we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs related to the existing contracts, resulting in a charge of $13 million. Extended Stay Lodging includes our Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Marriott Executive Apartments and Marriott ExecuStay brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 608 $ 547 $ 557 11% 2% Segment results $ 65 $ 66 $ 47 2% 40% 2005 Compared to 2004 Across the Extended Stay Lodging segment, we added 37 hotels (4,293 rooms) in 2005. Our base and incentive management fees in 2005 were $12 million higher than the prior year and our franchise fees, principally associated with our Residence Inn brand, also increased $12 million. The increase in management and franchise fees is largely due to higher RevPAR driven by increased demand and to the growth in the number of rooms. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue, net of direct expenses declined $12 million compared to a year ago primarily as a result of our ExecuStay brands shift toward franchising. Gains and other income was $11 million lower than last year, primarily reflecting gains on sales of real estate in 2004 versus no gains in 2005. General and administrative costs were slightly higher, primarily reflecting 2005 pre tax expenses of $4 million associated with our bedding incentive program and a $6 million charge in 2005 associated with the settlement of litigation, almost entirely offset by lower general, administrative and other expenses, including lower costs associated with ExecuStays shift toward franchising. RevPAR for Select Service and Extended Stay Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels increased 9.4 percent to $76.49. Occupancy for these hotels increased slightly to 73.8 percent from 72.6 percent in 2004, while average daily rates increased 8.7 percent to $103.70. 2004 Compared to 2003 In 2004, we added 20 hotels (2,303 rooms) and deflagged one hotel (80 rooms) across our Extended Stay Lodging segment. The decline in our Extended Stay Lodging segment revenue in 2004 is primarily attributable to the shift in the ExecuStay business from management to franchising. We entered into more than 20 new franchise markets in 2004, and only five managed markets remain at the end of 2004. Our base management fees increased $4 million, and our incentive management fees were essentially flat with last year, while our franchise fees, principally associated with our Residence Inn brand, increased $9 million. The increase in franchise fees is largely due to the growth in the number of rooms and an increase in RevPAR. In addition, gains of $10 million in 2004 were favorable to the prior year by $4 million. ExecuStay experienced improved results compared to the prior year, resulting from increased occupancy, primarily in the New York market, coupled with lower operating costs associated with the shift in business toward franchising. The $2 million increase in general and administrative costs associated with supporting the segments hotel brands was more than offset by the $6 million decline in ExecuStays general and administrative costs associated with ExecuStays shift toward franchising. 39 Table of Contents RevPAR for Select Service and Extended Stay Lodging comparable company operated North American hotels increased 9.1 percent to $68.66. Occupancy for these hotels increased to 72.6 percent from 70.0 percent in 2003, while average daily rates increased 4.4 percent to $94.52. Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club International, The Ritz Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Revenues $ 1,721 $ 1,502 $ 1,279 15% 17% Segment results $ 271 $ 203 $ 149 33% 36% 2005 Compared to 2004 Timeshare revenues of $1,721 million and $1,502 million, in 2005 and 2004, respectively, include interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales, base management fees, resort rental fees and cost reimbursements. Timeshare contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, which represent sales of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting, were flat as compared to last year, reflecting limited available inventory at several projects in 2005 which are approaching sell out status versus higher contract sales at those projects in the prior year. The favorable segment results compared with 2004 reflect a $51 million increase in timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue under the percentage of completion accounting, a higher development margin, primarily resulting from the mix of units sold, and higher financing income reflecting a higher average notes receivable portfolio balance in 2005. In addition, compared with 2004, base fees increased $4 million, gains increased $6 million, equity earnings increased $8 million, and general and administrative expenses were flat. Improved equity results primarily reflect start up losses in 2004 versus earnings in 2005 associated with one joint venture, and the increase in gains is attributable to note sales which generated gains of $69 million in 2005 compared to $64 million in 2004. In 2005 we also decided to cease development of one land parcel, and we recorded a $7 million charge in conjunction with the write off of the previously capitalized costs which impacted our timeshare direct expenses. 2004 Compared to 2003 Timeshare segment revenues totaled $1,502 million and $1,279 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Including our three joint ventures, contract sales increased 31 percent, primarily due to strong demand in South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, California, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and Aruba. The favorable segment results reflect a 9 percent increase in timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales services revenue, higher margins, primarily resulting from lower marketing and selling costs, and the mix of units sold, partially offset by $24 million of higher administrative expenses. Our note sales gain of $64 million was flat compared to the prior year. In addition, we adjusted the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our residual interests due to current trends in interest rates and recorded a $7 million charge in 2004. Reported revenue growth trailed contract sales growth because of a higher proportion of sales in joint venture projects and projects with lower average construction completion. Synthetic Fuel See the Synthetic Fuel caption in the Part I, Item 1 Business section earlier in this report for information related to our synthetic fuel investment and how we have accounted for that investment. The tables below detail the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Our management evaluates the figures presented in the Before Syn. Fuel columns because management expects the Synthetic Fuel segment will no longer have a material impact on our business after the Internal Revenue Code Section 29 synthetic fuel tax credits expire at the end of 2007 and because the presentation reflects the results of our core Lodging operations. Management also believes that these presentations facilitate the comparison of our results with the results of other lodging companies. However, the figures presented in the Before Syn. Fuel columns are non GAAP financial measures, may be calculated and or presented differently than presentations of other companies, and are not alternatives to operating income, total tax (provision) benefit, income from continuing operations, or any other operating measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 40 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 For 2005, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $421 million versus revenue of $321 million for the prior year, primarily due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue for the entire 2005 year compared with only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. The $18 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to $125 million from $107 million in 2004 is primarily due to our increased proportion of tax credits through May 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE II facilities that were then under IRS review and higher gains and other income, partially offset by our decreased proportion of tax credits through March 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE I facility that was not under IRS review. In addition, in 2005 production was slightly lower and raw materials prices were higher than in 2004. Gains and other income represents net earn out payments received. Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $47 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)) through year end. For 2005, minority interest represents our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year.

The $11 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to $107 million in 2004 from $96 million in the prior year is primarily due to slightly higher production in 2004. Gains and other income of $28 million represents net earn out payments received. In addition, equity losses of $28 million include net earn out payments made of $6 million. Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures. Minority interest for 2003 reflected our partners share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit, along with its share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put options expiration date. For 2004, minority interest reflected our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004, when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R), through year end.

The SOP is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Under the SOP, we will charge the majority of the costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We will also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We will also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which require us to record any excess profits as a reduction of inventory costs. We estimate that the initial adoption of the SOP in our 2006 first quarter, which we will report as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our fiscal year 2006 financial statements, will result in a one time non cash after tax charge of approximately $110 million to $115 million, consisting primarily of the write off of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserves on notes. We estimate the ongoing impact of the adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial. 42 Table of Contents FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS No. 123R), which is a revision of FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. FAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We will adopt FAS No. 123R at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year. We estimate the adoption of FAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective method, will result in incremental pre tax expense in fiscal year 2006 of approximately $44 million, based on our current share based payment compensation plans, assumptions reflecting currently available information and recent interpretations related to accounting for share based awards granted to eligible retirees. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Senior Living Services We completed the sale of our senior living management business along with a parcel of land to Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. and the sale of nine senior living communities to CNL Retirement Properties, Inc., in 2003 for $266 million. We recorded an after tax gain on disposal of $19 million and after tax income from operations of $7 million in 2003 associated with our discontinued senior living services business. Distribution Services In 2005 and 2004, we had income, net of tax of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, associated with the distribution services business we exited in 2002. 43 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for aggregate borrowings of $2.0 billion expiring in 2010, which supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit. This facility became effective on June 6, 2005, replacing two multicurrency credit agreements in the same aggregate amount which would otherwise have expired in 2006. As with the facilities it replaced, borrowings under this new facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on our public debt rating. With the exception of the 2010 expiration date, the material terms of the new credit agreement are the same as those of the replaced agreements. We classify commercial paper as long term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. At year end 2005 we had no loans and $93 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. At year end 2005 our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.611 billion and reflected borrowing capacity at $2.0 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of $203 million less the letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $93 million and a $499 million reserve for outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. In the fourth quarter of 2005 we began issuing short term commercial paper in Europe in addition to our long standing commercial paper program in the United States. Our U.S. and European commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper market, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash from operations $ 837 $ 891 $ 403 Depreciation expense 156 133 132 Amortization expense 28 33 28 44 Table of Contents While our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare business (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare business): ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Timeshare development, less the cost of sales $ 40 $ 93 $ (94 ) New timeshare mortgages, net of collections (441 ) (459 ) (247 ) Loan repurchases (23 ) (18 ) (19 ) Note sale gains (69 ) (64 ) (64 ) Note sale proceeds 399 312 231 Financially reportable sales (in excess of) less than closed sales (57 ) 129 (4 ) Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 90 94 50 Other cash inflows 55 26 36 Net cash (outflows) inflows from timeshare activity $ (6 ) $ 113 $ (111 ) Our ability to sell timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. We might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such a deterioration. Loans to timeshare owners, including a current portion of $33 million, totaled $344 million at year end 2005. Loans to timeshare owners, including a current portion of $26 million, totaled $315 million at year end 2004. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly one to one at year end 2005 and 0.8 to one at year end 2004. Each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 4.3 x 4.7 x 3.6 x 3.2 x 2.4 x Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $780 million in 2005, $181 million in 2004 and $210 million in 2003 primarily included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Included in the 2005 capital expenditures are the properties purchased from CTF Holdings Ltd. as described below. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development, subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. During the 2005 third quarter, we purchased from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively CTF) 13 properties (in each case through a purchase of real estate, a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel, or an assignment of CTFs leasehold rights) and certain joint venture interests from CTF for an aggregate price of $381 million. Prior to the sale, all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries. 45 Table of Contents We plan to sell eight of the properties we have purchased to date to third party owners, and the balances related to these properties are classified within the Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for sale captions in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. One operating lease has terminated. We operate the four remaining properties under leases, three of which expire by 2012. Under the purchase and sale agreement we signed with CTF in the second quarter of 2005, we remain obligated to purchase two additional properties for $17 million, the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain third party consents. On the closing date we and CTF also modified management agreements on 29 other CTF leased hotels, 28 located in Europe and one located in the United States. We became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. We continue to manage 16 of these hotels under new long term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $79 million remained in these trust accounts at the end of 2005. Our financial statements reflect us as lessee on these hotels. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows: $32 million in 2006; $33 million in 2007; $33 million in 2008; $33 million in 2009; $33 million in 2010 and $231 million thereafter, for a total of $395 million. For the remaining 13 European leased hotels, CTF may terminate management agreements with us if and when CTF obtains releases from landlords of our back up guarantees. Pending completion of the CTF landlord agreements, we continue to manage these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases. CTF has made available 35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $217 million will decline. We also continue to manage three hotels in the United Kingdom under amended management agreements with CTF and continue to manage 14 properties in Asia on behalf of New World Development Company Limited and its affiliates. CTFs principals are officers, directors and stockholders of New World Development Company Limited. At the closing date, the owners of the United Kingdom and Asian hotels agreed to invest $17 million to renovate those properties. We and CTF also exchanged legal releases effective as of the closing date, and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed. Simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing transactions, CTF also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (Sunstone) for $419 million, eight properties to Walton Street Capital, L.L.C. (Walton Street) for $578 million, and two properties to Tarsadia Hotels (Tarsadia) for $29 million, in each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with CTF. Prior to consummation of the sales, we also operated all of these properties. At closing, Walton Street and Sunstone entered into new long term management agreements with us and agreed to invest a combined $68 million to further upgrade the 13 properties they acquired. The two properties purchased by Tarsadia are being operated under short term management and franchise agreements. When we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005 second quarter, we recorded a $94 million pre tax charge primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these transactions. As described above, we entered into new long term management agreements with CTF, Walton Street and Sunstone at the closing of the transactions, and we expect to sell most of the properties we acquired subject to long term management agreements. In 2005, we also purchased two full service properties for aggregate cash consideration of $146 million. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $298 million in 2005, $402 million in 2004 and $494 million in 2003. Property and asset sales in 2005 primarily consisted of land parcel sales, including those as described below, and we also sold two minority interests in joint ventures. Late in 2005 we contributed land underlying an additional nine Courtyard hotels, worth approximately $40 million, to Courtyard by Marriott Land Joint Venture limited partnership (CBM Land JV), a joint venture the majority of which is owned by Sarofim Realty Advisors on behalf of an institutional investor, thereby obtaining a 23 percent equity stake in CBM Land JV. At the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land underlying 46 Table of Contents 75 Courtyard hotels for approximately $246 million in cash to CBM Land JV. We recognized a pre tax gain of $17 million in 2005, we deferred recognition of $5 million of pre tax gain due to our minority interest in the joint venture, and we also deferred recognition of $40 million of pre tax gain due to contingencies in the transaction documents. As those contingencies expire in subsequent years, we will recognize additional gains. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2005, amounted to $650 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $59 million (which included a current portion of $2 million) at year end 2005 and $75 million (which included a current portion of $17 million) at year end 2004. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $274 million (which included a current portion of $13 million) at year end 2005 and $867 million (which included a current portion of $25 million) at year end 2004. In 2005 our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $609 million and primarily reflects the repayment of several loans including the loan associated with our Courtyard joint venture (described more fully below under the Courtyard Joint Venture caption). Unfunded commitments aggregating $11 million were outstanding at year end 2005, of which we expect to fund $5 million in 2006. Investment in Leveraged Lease. At year end 2005, we have a $23 million gross investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc., which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wishes to restructure the lease. As a result, we believe our investment is impaired, and have recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $17 million in 2005, leaving a net exposure of $6 million. Equity and Cost Method Investments Cash outflows of $231 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in the 2005 second quarter of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC (Whitbread) to acquire Whitbreads portfolio of 46 franchised Marriott and Renaissance hotels totaling over 8,000 rooms, and for us to take over management of the entire portfolio of hotels upon the transfer of the hotels to the new joint venture. Whitbread sold its interest in the 46 hotels to the joint venture for approximately &pound;995 million. Whitbread received approximately &pound;710 million in cash (including &pound;620 million from senior debt proceeds) and 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint venture and non voting deferred consideration shares valued at &pound;285 million. We contributed approximately &pound;90 million ($171 million) in the second quarter of 2005 for the remaining 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint venture. The joint venture is currently discussing the sale of the hotels with a potential purchaser. As the joint venture sells the hotels, our interest in the joint venture will be redeemed. The joint venture expects to sell the hotels in early 2006 subject to long term management agreements with us. In 2005 we also contributed cash of $35 million and a note of $40 million for a $75 million 50 percent interest in a joint venture developing a mixed use project, consisting of timeshare, fractional, and whole ownership products in Hawaii. We expect sales will begin in late 2006. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased $412 million in 2005, from $1,325 million to $1,737 million at year end 2005, due to the issuance of $348 million (book value) of Series F Senior Notes (the Series F Notes), net commercial paper issuances of $499 million, and other debt increases of $69 million, partially offset by repayment upon maturity of $200 million for the Series B Senior Notes, repayment upon maturity of $275 million for the Series D Senior Notes and the $29 million (book value) debt decrease associated with the Series C and Series E debt exchange described below. Debt decreased $130 million in 2004, from $1,455 million to $1,325 million, due to the repurchase of all of our remaining zero coupon convertible senior Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021, also known as LYONs totaling $62 million, the maturity of $46 million of senior notes and other debt reductions of $22 million. In June 2005, we sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent Series F Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting a discount and underwriting fees, and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Series F Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on December 15, 2005. The Series F Notes will mature on June 15, 2012, and we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of 4.625% Series F Note due 2012. 47 Table of Contents In November 2005, we offered to holders of our outstanding 7 percent Series E Notes due 2008 and to holders of our outstanding 7.875 percent Series C Notes due 2009 (collectively Old Notes) an opportunity to exchange into new 5.81 percent Series G Notes and issued new Series G Notes in the aggregate total of $427 million to replace Old Notes that had been validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn, comprised of $203 million of the Series E Notes and $224 million of the Series C Notes. In addition, we paid an exchange price of $31 million ($9 million for the Series E Notes and $22 million for the Series C Notes) which was equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Old Notes. Furthermore, holders who had Old Notes accepted for exchange received a cash payment of $7 million representing accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date. The exchanges are not considered to be extinguishments, and accordingly, the exchange price payment, along with the existing unamortized discounts associated with the Series C Notes and Series E Notes, are being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the replacement debt instrument using the interest method. All other third party costs related to the exchange were expensed as incurred. Interest on the Series G Notes is payable on May 10 and November 10 of each year, beginning on May 10, 2006. The Series G Notes mature on November 10, 2015, and we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of 5.81% Series G Note due 2015. Our Series C Notes, Series E Notes, Series F Notes, and Series G Notes were all issued under an indenture with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated November 16, 1998. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2005, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 5.4 percent and an average maturity of approximately 6.3 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.7 to one at year end 2005. At the end of 2005, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. On December 8, 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by warrants, depositary shares, rights or purchase contracts. Share Repurchases. We purchased 25.7 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $64.23 per share, 14.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2004 at an average price of $46.65 per share, and 10.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2003 at an average price of $36.07 per share. As of year end 2005, 17.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. See Part I, Item 5 of this Form 10 K for additional information on the Companys share repurchases. Dividends. In May 2005, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 24 percent to $0.105 per share. Courtyard Joint Venture During the 2005 second quarter, Sarofim Realty Advisors (Sarofim), on behalf of an institutional investor, completed the acquisition of a 75 percent interest in the Courtyard joint venture, and we signed new long term management agreements with the joint venture. The transaction has accelerated the pace of reinventions and upgrades at the joint ventures 120 hotels. The termination of the previous management agreements was probable at year end 2004. Accordingly, in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs relating to the management agreements which existed at that time, resulting in a charge of $13 million. Prior to Sarofims acquisition, we and Host Marriott owned equal shares in the 120 property joint venture. With the addition of the new equity, our interest in the joint venture declined to approximately 21 percent and Host Marriotts interest declined to less than 4 percent. As part of the completed transaction, our mezzanine loan to the joint venture (including capitalized interest) totaling approximately $269 million was repaid. 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year end 2005: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Debt(1) $ 2,281 $ 127 $ 255 $ 222 $ 1,677 Capital lease obligations(1) 16 1 2 2 11 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,051 108 224 203 516 Non recourse 432 16 34 25 357 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 395 32 66 66 231 Other long term liabilities 49 7 42 Total contractual obligations $ 4,224 $ 284 $ 588 $ 518 $ 2,834 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments.

Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of hotels. The guarantees above include $320 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these pre existing guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under these guarantees. The guarantees above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $20 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available extensions of approximately $217 million. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted above, as of year end 2005 our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to $11 million. We expect to fund $5 million of those commitments within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $6 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $4 million within one year and $2 million after five years. 49 Table of Contents In 2005, we assigned to a third party our previous commitment to fund up to $129 million to the Courtyard joint venture for the primary purpose of funding the costs of renovating its properties in 2005 and 2006. Under the agreement, the third party assumed the lending obligation to the venture. As of year end 2005, we funded $1 million and the third party funded $22 million under this loan commitment. The commitment to fund is reduced to $27 million in September 2006 and expires in December 2009. In total, we expect that no more than $104 million of the $129 million commitment will be funded, and other than the $1 million we already funded, we expect the third party to provide all future fundings. We do not anticipate making further fundings ourselves, but remain secondarily obligated to the Courtyard joint venture if the third party fails to fund. At year end 2005, that secondary obligation totaled $106 million and is not reflected in our outstanding loan commitments discussed in the preceding paragraph. At year end 2005 we also have commitments to invest $27 million of equity for minority interests in three partnerships, which plan to purchase both full service and select service hotels in the United States and Canada. At year end 2005 we also had $93 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year end 2005 totaled $546 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and self insurance programs. As part of the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels. Since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Base management fees $ 83 $ 72 $ 56 Incentive management fees 14 8 4 Cost reimbursements 936 802 699 Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue 22 29 28 Total revenue $ 1,055 $ 911 $ 787 General, administrative and other $ (19 ) $ (33 ) $ (11 ) Reimbursed costs (936 ) (802 ) (699 ) Gains and other income 54 19 21 Interest income 31 74 77 Reversal of (provision for) loan losses 3 (2 ) Equity in (losses) earnings Synthetic fuel (28 ) 10 Equity in earnings (losses) Other 36 (14 ) (17 ) 50 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2005 2004 Current assets accounts and notes receivable $ 48 $ 72 Contract acquisition costs 26 24 Cost method investments 121 Equity method investments 349 249 Loans to equity method investees 36 526 Other long term receivables 3 Other long term assets 166 38 Long term deferred tax asset, net 19 17 Current liabilities: Accounts payable (2 ) (3 ) Other payables and accruals (45 ) (4 ) Other long term liabilities (101 ) (11 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. 51 Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, which assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year end 2005 our recorded investment in impaired loans was $184 million. We have a $103 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses. At year end 2004, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $181 million. During 2005 and 2004, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $182 million and $161 million, respectively. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 52 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in equity prices from our investments in common stock, which have a carrying value of $53 million at year end 2005 and are accounted for as available for sale securities under FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year end 2005 we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. Six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our Timeshare segment note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $380 million, and they expire through 2022. Forward foreign exchange and option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2005. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts is approximately $27 million, and they expire throughout 2006. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts is $544 million at year end 2005, and they expire throughout 2006. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts have a dollar notional equivalent of $229 million at year end 2005, and they expire throughout 2006. 53 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year end 2005: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 There after Total Carrying Amount Total Fair Value Assets Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
