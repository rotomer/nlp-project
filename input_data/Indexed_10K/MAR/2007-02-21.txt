Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,832 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into six business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership properties; (2) operating the resorts; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations. Generally, lodging demand remained robust through 2006, driven by continued strength associated with business and leisure travelers, while lodging supply growth continued to remain low. At the property level, these factors enabled us to increase rates and improve revenue mix, which resulted in strong year over year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This deliberate strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year over year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines. Rates have also increased as stronger demand enabled us to reduce available discounts and special rates. In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. Demand for our brands is strong in most markets around the world, and the weak U.S. dollar continues to drive international travelers into the United States. For our North American properties, RevPAR increases in 2006 as compared to the year ago period were particularly strong in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle. Across the U.S., demand also strengthened in many smaller city and suburban markets during 2006. Internationally, RevPAR increases in 2006 versus the prior year were particularly strong in China, Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information rich and easy to use Web site, a multi channel central reservations system and desired property amenities including meeting and banquet facilities, fitness centers, spas, award winning restaurants and high speed and wireless Internet access. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of both new and renovated properties, new room and public space designs, enhanced amenities and technology offerings. See the Risk Factors, section of this report for important information regarding forward looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Continuing Operations Revenues 2006 Compared to 2005 Revenues increased 5 percent to $12,160 million in 2006 from $11,550 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, partially offset by a decline in revenue associated with our synthetic fuel operation. Base management and franchise fees increased $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior period 24 Table of Contents results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees improved $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property level margins higher. Year over year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our purchase, early in the second half of 2005, of 13 formerly managed properties from CTF Holdings Ltd. (CTF). See Footnote No. 8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, later in this report for a detailed description of the CTF transaction. As planned, eight of the CTF properties were sold during 2006: one property was sold in the 2006 first quarter; five properties were sold in the 2006 second quarter; and two properties were sold in the 2006 third quarter. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased $90 million (6 percent) over the prior year. The increase largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed later in the Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Additionally, financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year, as did villa rental revenue. Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell out. As compared to 2005, synthetic fuel revenue was significantly lower in 2006, primarily due to the suspensions of production in 2006 as a result of high oil prices. Synthetic fuel production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2006. The 5 percent increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added mark up, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms), net, and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms), net, to our system in 2006. 2005 Compared to 2004 Revenues increased 14 percent to $11,550 million in 2005 from $10,099 million in 2004, as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Year over year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement. The increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. Higher timeshare sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues. In addition, revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. Further, owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed CTF properties. The 14 percent increase in total revenue includes $743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,671 million in 2005 from $6,928 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and wage increases. We added 45 managed properties (4,519 rooms), net, to our system in 2005 (including the Whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section), and we also added 49 franchised properties (6,333 rooms), net, to our system in 2005. Operating Income 2006 Compared to 2005 Operating income increased $456 million to $1,011 million in 2006 from $555 million in the prior year. The increase in 2006 is, in part, due to a combined base, franchise and incentive fee increase of $197 million, reflecting stronger RevPAR growth, unit growth and property level margin improvements. Stronger owned, leased, corporate 25 Table of Contents housing and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed $17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the CTF properties acquired in 2005. The $17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of $20 million, a $12 million increase in termination fees received and $5 million of higher other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower land lease income. Also reflected in the year over year change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling $7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two properties that were reclassified in 2006 from held for sale to held and used. The depreciation charges totaling $7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously classified as held and used. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased $98 million in 2006 and largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the Revenue discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million favorable variance, development revenue net of expenses increased $14 million and financing, services and other revenue net of expenses increased $7 million. Increased development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions (SOP 04 2), implemented in 2006. Increased financing, services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves in 2006. As compared to the year ago period, general, administrative and other expenses decreased by $76 million. In 2005, we incurred general, administrative and other expenses of $94 million primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements resulting from the CTF transaction. We also incurred general, administrative and other expenses of $30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program. We implemented the bedding incentive program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year end 2005. Further impacting general, administrative and other expenses, 2005 reflected performance cure payments of $15 million versus a $6 million similar payment in 2006, and 2005 also reflected $9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional $5 million of guarantee charges in 2006. Additionally impacting the year over year general, administrative and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling $6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of $5 million in 2005. Also impacting the year over year change in general, administrative and other expenses, development expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by $15 million and $5 million, respectively. As noted under the heading New Accounting Standards, later in this report, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with share based compensation. This new standard resulted in incremental general, administrative and other expenses of $39 million versus 2005, primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general, administrative and other expenses. Of the $76 million decrease in total general, administrative and other expenses, a decrease of $124 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $48 million increase was unallocated. Finally, operating income for 2006 included a synthetic fuel operating loss of $76 million versus an operating loss of $144 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting production suspensions in 2006 due to high oil prices. For additional information, see our Synthetic Fuel segment discussion later in this report. 2005 Compared to 2004 Operating income increased $78 million to $555 million in 2005 from $477 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the following items: a combined base, incentive and franchise fee improvement of $154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment; $51 million of stronger timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue; and $65 million of stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses. The fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, including the CTF properties, and to a lesser extent the strong demand environment in 2005, and our receipt in 2005, of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. The favorable items noted above were also partially offset by $146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and $46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses. Increased general, administrative and other expenses were associated with our Lodging segments as unallocated general, administrative and other expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflects a $94 million charge impacting our North American Full Service and International Lodging segments, primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements associated with our acquisition of the CTF properties, and $30 million of 26 Table of Contents expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, impacting our North American Full Service, North American Limited Service and International Lodging segments. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 also reflect pre tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties, a $9 million pre tax charge associated with three guarantees, increased other net overhead costs of $13 million including costs related to the Companys unit growth, development and systems, and $2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by $5 million of lower litigation expenses. Additionally, in 2004, general, administrative and other expenses included a $13 million charge associated with the write off of deferred contract acquisition costs. Operating income for 2005 included a synthetic fuel operating loss of $144 million versus a $98 million operating loss in the prior year, reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. For additional information, see our Synthetic Fuel segment discussion later in this report. Gains and Other Income The following table shows our gains and other income for 2006, 2005 and 2004. ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Timeshare segment note sale gains $ $ 69 $ 64 Synthetic fuel earn out payments (made) received, net (15 ) 32 28 Loss on expected land sale (37 ) Gains on sales of real estate and other 26 34 48 Other note sale/repayment gains 2 25 5 Gains on sale/income on redemption of joint venture investments 68 7 19 Income from cost method joint ventures 15 14 $ 59 $ 181 $ 164 Gains on sale/income on redemption of joint venture investments of $68 million in 2006 represents $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and $25 million of income associated with the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee. As further explained in the earlier Revenues discussion for 2006, Timeshare segment note sale gains of $77 million in 2006 are presented in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. Interest Expense 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest expense increased $18 million (17 percent) to $124 million in 2006 from $106 million in 2005. Included within interest expense for 2006 are charges totaling $46 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners behalf, including the Marriott Rewards, Gift Certificates and Self Insurance programs. The increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Interest expense also increased in 2006, due to our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance, our June 2006 Series H Notes issuance, and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Notes for lower interest rate Series G Notes in 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest expense increased $7 million (7 percent) to $106 million in 2005 from $99 million in the prior year, reflecting increased debt levels, which helped to facilitate significantly higher capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2005. Interest expense in 2005 reflected our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance and, versus the prior year, higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Included within interest expense for 2005 are charges totaling $29 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners behalf, including the Marriott Rewards, Gift Certificates and Self Insurance programs. The increase over 2004 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the capitalization of more interest associated with the development of timeshare properties. 27 Table of Contents Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased $34 million (43 percent) to $45 million in 2006 from $79 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us in 2005. Also reflected in the decrease versus the prior year are $4 million of mark to market expenses in 2006 associated with hedges for our synthetic fuel operations. Loan loss provisions decreased $31 million versus the prior year reflecting the reversal of loan loss provisions totaling $3 million in 2006 compared to a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta Air Lines, Inc. aircraft leveraged lease, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption later in this report for additional information, and an $11 million loan loss provision in 2005 associated with one property. Our tax provision totaled $286 million in 2006 compared to a tax provision of $94 million in 2005. The difference of $192 million is primarily attributable to $96 million of higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pre tax income from our lodging operations and $96 million of lower tax credits and tax benefit in 2006 associated with our synthetic fuel operations that generated a net tax benefit of $94 million in 2006 compared to a net tax benefit of $190 million in 2005. As discussed in more detail in the Synthetic Fuel segment caption later in this report, 2006 includes a provision for an estimated 39 percent phase out of tax credits associated with the synthetic fuel operations due to high oil prices. 2005 Compared to 2004 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased $67 million (46 percent) to $79 million in 2005 from $146 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us. Our provision for loan losses increased $36 million versus the prior year reflecting an $11 million charge in 2005 associated with one property and a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta Air Lines, Inc. aircraft leveraged lease and the reversal in 2004 of loan loss provisions totaling $8 million. Our tax provision totaled $94 million in 2005 compared to a tax provision of $100 million in 2004. The difference of $6 million is primarily attributable to $19 million of higher taxes in 2005 associated with higher pre tax income from our lodging operations, more than offset by $25 million of higher tax credits and tax benefit in 2005 associated with our synthetic fuel operations that generated a net tax benefit of $190 million in 2005 compared to a net tax benefit of $165 million in 2004, and to a lesser extent, to a lower tax rate before the impact of the Synthetic Fuel segment in 2005, as a result of a higher proportion of income in countries with lower effective tax rates. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2006 Compared to 2005 The $33 million decline from earnings of $36 million in 2005 to earnings of $3 million in 2006, attributable to our equity investments, reflected the recognition in 2005 of $30 million of equity earnings from the sale of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests. In addition, since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures. 2005 Compared to 2004 Equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees increased $78 million from a net loss of $42 million in 2004 to net earnings of $36 million in 2005. Twenty eight million dollars of the increase is attributable to our synthetic fuel joint ventures that we reported as an equity investment in the 2004 first quarter, versus consolidation of the joint ventures for the periods thereafter. For additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment later in this report. The remaining $50 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to several joint ventures with significant asset sales in 2005, favorably impacting the profitability of the joint ventures, producing higher earnings from joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, the stronger 2005 lodging demand environment and the mix of investments in each year. Minority Interest 2006 Compared to 2005 Minority interest decreased $39 million in 2006 from a benefit of $45 million in 2005 to a benefit of $6 million. On the first day of our 2006 fiscal year, we redeemed our partners interest in Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises II, LLC (SAFE II), which owns three of our four synthetic fuel production facilities. Also, effective October 1, 2006, we purchased our partners interest in Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises I, LLC (SAFE I). Accordingly, in 2006, minority interest represents only our partners share of the losses in SAFE I, through 28 Table of Contents September 30, 2006. For 2005, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses for all four production facilities. In addition, synthetic fuel operating losses in 2006 were significantly lower versus 2005 reflecting reduced production. For additional information, see Footnote No. 2, Synthetic Fuel, later in this report. 2005 Compared to 2004 Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $45 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year end. For 2005, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year. Income from Continuing Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Compared to 2005, income from continuing operations increased $49 million (7 percent) to $717 million in 2006, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.21 (14 percent) to $1.66. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income ($197 million), lower general, administrative and other expenses ($76 million), lower synthetic fuel operating losses ($68 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses ($17 million), a lower loan loss provision ($31 million) and higher timeshare interval sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($98 million). Partially offsetting these favorable variances, were significantly higher taxes ($192 million), lower gains and other income ($122 million), lower interest income ($34 million), higher interest expense ($18 million), a lower minority interest benefit ($39 million) and lower equity investment results ($33 million). 2005 Compared to 2004 Income from continuing operations increased $74 million (12 percent) to $668 million in 2005 versus the prior year, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.21 (17 percent) to $1.45. As discussed above in more detail, the increase in income from continuing operations from the prior year is primarily due to the strong demand environment for lodging, increased owned, leased and corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses ($65 million), principally reflecting owned and leased properties acquired in the 2005 third quarter, increased timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($51 million), stronger equity investment results ($78 million), higher gains and other income ($17 million) and lower taxes ($6 million). As discussed earlier in the report in more detail, increased general, administrative and other expenses ($146 million) reflected, among other things, the write off of deferred contract acquisition costs in connection with the CTF transaction and expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, higher synthetic fuel operating losses ($46 million), lower interest income ($67 million), higher interest expense ($7 million) and a higher loan loss provision ($36 million) partially offset these favorable items. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 2006 Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04 2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to exclude accounting for real estate time sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04 2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04 2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The initial adoption of SOP 04 2 in our 2006 first quarter, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statement of Income, resulted in a non cash after tax charge of $105 million ($0.24 per diluted share). As a result of tax rate adjustments in the 2006 fourth quarter, we reduced the tax benefit associated with the initial adoption from $68 million to $64 million. Accordingly, the after tax impact of 29 Table of Contents the adoption was $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). As a result of the change, Net Income of $65 million ($0.15 per diluted share) as reported in the 2006 first quarter, now totals $61 million ($0.14 per diluted share). The pre tax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial. The American Resort Development Association, a timeshare trade association of which we are a member, and the Staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had communications regarding SOP 04 2 and the income statement presentation of timeshare note securitizations gains. As a result of those communications, we reclassified in our 2006 third quarter, in our Consolidated Statement of Income, Timeshare segment note securitization gains of $40 million recognized in the 2006 second quarter from the Gains and other income caption to the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. As a result of the change, Timeshare sales and services revenue of $331 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $371 million, and Gains and other income of $48 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $8 million. Including $37 million of Timeshare segment note securitization gains recognized in the 2006 fourth quarter, full year 2006 note securitization gains totaling $77 million are reflected within our Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. We estimate that, for the 20 year period from 2007 through 2026, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $1.9 billion. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in six business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport brands located in the continental United States and Canada; North American Limited Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites and Marriott ExecuStay brands located in the continental United States and Canada; International Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International and Marriott Executive Apartments brands located outside the continental United States and Canada; Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts brands worldwide; Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation and sale of timeshare, fractional and whole ownership properties under the Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands worldwide; and Synthetic Fuel, which includes our interest in the operation of coal based synthetic fuel production facilities. In 2006, the company analyzed its internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency. As part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting and made certain changes that were in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These reporting changes are in conformity with the requirements of FAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, (FAS No. 131) and will better enable investors to view the Company the way management views it. Accordingly, we now report six operating segments as compared to five before the change and indirect administrative expenses are no longer allocated to our segments. Senior management allocates resources and assesses performance based on the six operating segments. The revised segment reporting is reflected throughout this report for all periods presented. Historical figures are presented in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense or indirect general, administrative and other expenses. With the exception of the Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes or interest income to our segments. As note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. 30 Table of Contents We have aggregated the brands presented within our North American Full Service, North American Limited Service, International and Luxury segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational structure and management reporting structure.

We consider Lodging revenues and Lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies. 32 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 We added 136 properties (23,466 rooms) and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system in 2006. Most of the properties that left the system were limited service properties. Lodging financial results increased $314 million to $1,415 million in 2006 from $1,101 million in 2005, and revenues increased $857 million to $11,930 million in 2006, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,073 million in 2005. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $197 million (19 percent) increase in combined base, franchise and incentive fees from $1,027 million in 2005 to $1,224 million in 2006, $124 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses, $8 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses and $98 million of higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $78 million of lower gains and other income and a $37 million decline in earnings associated with equity investments. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth drove the increase in base and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased $80 million (40 percent) during 2006, reflecting the impact of strong room rate improvement and property level margin improvements. Incentive fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior period earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. In 2006, 62 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 51 percent in 2005. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased 9.1 percent over 2005, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased 8.9 percent. North American company operated house profit margins improved 240 basis points versus 2005. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased 10.5 percent and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased 11.1 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.4 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased 9.5 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins increased 230 basis points. 2005 Compared to 2004 We added 134 properties (21,611 rooms) and 25 properties (4,755 rooms) left the system in 2005. Most of the properties that left the system were Fairfield Inn properties. Lodging financial results increased $184 million to $1,101 million in 2005 from $917 million in 2004, and revenues increased $1,340 million to $11,073 million in 2005, a 14 percent increase from revenues of $9,733 million in 2004. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $154 million (18 percent) increase in base, franchise and incentive fees from $873 million in 2004 to $1,027 million in 2005, $54 million of higher owned, lease and other revenue net of expenses, an increase of $51 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses, $49 million of increased equity results, and increased gains and other income of $12 million, partially offset by $134 million of higher general, administrative and other expenses. The increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, primarily resulting from both domestic and international rate increases and new unit growth. Incentive management fees increased $59 million (42 percent) in 2005 versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of increased travel worldwide, driving strong property level profits. The increase also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. In 2005, 51 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 32 percent in 2004. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased 9.5 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased 9.8 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased 11.9 percent and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased 11.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased 10.1 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased 9.9 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins increased 180 basis points. 33 Table of Contents Lodging Development We opened 136 properties totaling 23,466 rooms, across our brands in 2006, and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system. Highlights of the year included: We converted 30 properties (6,869 rooms), or 29 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 27 percent of the rooms were located in international markets; We opened over 28 percent of the new rooms outside the United States; We added 91 properties (11,281 rooms) to our Limited Service brands; and We opened our second Bulgari Hotels & Resorts brand property in Bali, Indonesia in September 2006. We currently have approximately 100,000 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our pipeline, and we expect to add approximately 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2007. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report. RevPAR The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full Service and North American Limited Service segments, for our International segment by region and the principal brand in our Luxury Segment, The Ritz Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005 through December 29, 2006, the statistics for 2005 include the period from January 1, 2005 through December 30, 2005, and the statistics for 2004 include the period from January 3, 2004 through December 31, 2004 (except in each case, for The Ritz Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 34 Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable Systemwide North American Properties (1) 2006 Change vs. 2005 2006 Change vs. 2005 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 72.3 % 0.6 % pts. 70.9 % 0.2 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 5,196 $ 5,116 $ 4,691 2 % 9 % Segment results $ 455 $ 349 $ 337 30 % 4 % 2006 Compared to 2005 In 2006, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,971 rooms) and six properties (1,604 rooms) left the system. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties increased 8.5 percent to $121.10. Occupancy for these properties decreased 0.4 percentage points while average daily rates increased 9.0 percent to $167.27. Compared to the prior year, our 2006 results reflect a $59 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, to higher food and beverage, meeting room rental and other revenue and productivity improvements, all of which favorably impacted property level house profit margins. The growth in the number of rooms, year over year, also contributed to the increase in fees. Incentive fees included $10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until they were recognized. Similarly, base management fees for 2006 included $4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2006. Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased $8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property, partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of $10 million in termination fees. General, administrative and other expenses decreased $69 million as a result of, among other things, a $60 million charge in 2005, associated with the CTF transaction, more fully discussed in the previous Operating Income discussion, as well as expenses of $14 million in 2005, related to our bedding incentive program, partially offset by increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development, systems improvements and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. In 2005, general, administrative and other expenses included $3 million of performance cure payments associated with one property. In 2006, general, administrative and other expenses included a $5 million performance cure payment. Gains and other income was $3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties. Gains and other income for 2006 reflected a $37 million non cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we own and lease, as further described in the Expected Land Sale caption later in this report. Equity results decreased by $19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006, offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment. 2005 Compared to 2004 In 2005, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (6,141 rooms) and five properties (1,995 rooms) left the system. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties increased 9.6 percent to $112.41. Occupancy for these properties increased 1.4 percentage points while average daily rates increased 7.5 percent to $154.00. Compared to the prior year, our 2005 segment results reflect a $58 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees and $35 million of increased owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases that favorably impact property level house profits, the growth in the number of rooms and the recognition in 2005 of $10 million of 41 Table of Contents incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, many of which were sold throughout 2006 as expected, including the CTF properties. In addition, owned, leased and other revenue in 2005 reflected our receipt of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. Somewhat offsetting the net favorable variances were $78 million of higher general, administrative and other expenses. As noted in the preceding Operating Income discussion, during 2005 we recorded a $60 million pre tax charge, primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of CTF management agreements, and we incurred expenses of $14 million related to our bedding incentive program, both of which impacted our general, administrative and other expenses. In 2005, we also recorded performance termination cure payments of $3 million associated with one property, which impacted general, administrative and other expenses. In addition, in 2005 there were increased overhead costs associated with unit growth and development. Further impacting segment results, gains and other income was $15 million lower than the prior year, while equity results increased by $13 million versus the prior year. The decrease in gains and other income is primarily attributable to the $13 million gain in 2004 associated with the sale of our interest in the Two Flags Joint Venture. The increase in equity results is primarily attributable to several joint ventures that had significant asset sales in 2005 generating gains, and to a lesser extent, the favorable variance is also a result of a stronger demand environment and the mix of investments. North American Limited Service Lodging includes our Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 2,060 $ 1,886 $ 1,673 9 % 13 % Segment results $ 380 $ 303 $ 233 25 % 30 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 91 properties (11,329 rooms) and 28 properties (3,647 rooms) left the system in 2006. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties increased 9.1 percent to $84.41. Occupancy for these properties decreased 0.8 percentage points to 73.3 percent, while average daily rates increased 10.4 percent to $115.24. The $77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $77 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $27 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses and $6 million of increased equity results, partially offset by $14 million of lower owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and $19 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Stronger performance at our renovated Courtyard properties, versus nonrenovated properties, is also contributing to the increase in segment results over the prior year. The decrease in owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale, late in 2005, of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand. The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $11 million associated with our bedding incentive program, a $6 million litigation charge and a $3 million guarantee charge. Improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006, new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the first quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. Gains and other income decreased $19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture, partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of $4 million in 2006 and increased income of $4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures. 42 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 94 properties (11,170 rooms) and 18 properties (2,309 rooms) left the system in 2005. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties increased 9.4 percent to $76.49. Occupancy for these properties increased 0.5 percentage points to 73.8 percent, while average daily rates increased 8.7 percent to $103.70. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms. The $70 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $57 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $8 million of lower owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, $3 million of higher gains and other income, an $11 million increase in equity results, and $7 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 included $11 million of expenses associated with our bedding incentive program. In 2004 we wrote off deferred contract acquisition costs, impacting general, administrative and other expenses, totaling $13 million. The 2005 increase in gains and other income is primarily a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, which generated gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture and increased income of $4 million in 2005 associated with cost method joint ventures, partially offset by $27 million of gains in 2004 primarily associated with land sales. The decline in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to our ExecuStay brands shift to franchising. Improved equity results primarily reflect the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the 2005 first quarter versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. Stronger performance at our reinvented Courtyard properties, versus non reinvented properties, is also contributing to the increase in revenue and segment results from the prior year. For additional information related to the Courtyard Joint Venture, see the Courtyard Joint Venture caption in Liquidity and Capital Resources later in this report. International Lodging includes our International Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, International Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, International Courtyard, International Fairfield Inn, International Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 1,411 $ 1,017 $ 604 39 % 68 % Segment results $ 237 $ 133 $ 109 78 % 22 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 22 properties (5,242 rooms) and 10 properties (3,136 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased 11.1 percent to $114.61. Occupancy for these properties increased 1.2 percentage points to 74.4 percent, while average daily rates increased 9.4 percent to $153.99. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. China, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and certain Middle Eastern countries all had strong RevPAR increases. The $104 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $43 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, $37 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses, $29 million of increased owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in gains and other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower equity results. Incentive fees included $10 million and $4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior period earnings, but not earned and due until the periods they were recognized. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Equity results decreased $20 million in 2006 versus 2005 and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $14 million in equity earnings from a joint venture as a result of the ventures sale of a hotel and $4 million of increased equity losses in 2006 associated with one joint ventures hotel that was closed for renovation. The increase of $29 million in owned, leased and other revenue net of direct 43 Table of Contents expenses reflects $19 million of improved results for owned and leased properties primarily due to the stronger demand environment and an increase of $12 million for termination fees for several properties. The $19 million improvement in owned and lease results also reflects the impact of a $5 million charge in 2006 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from held for sale to held and used as it was not sold within one year of its classification as held for sale, as expected. The $15 million increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of various joint ventures throughout 2006, partially offset by lower other income associated with one of the sold cost method joint venture investments. The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $37 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $5 million associated with our bedding incentive program as well as a $34 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction discussed more fully in the previous operating income disclosure. Also impacting general, administrative and other expenses, in 2005 we recorded expenses totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees, and 2006 reflected $7 million of increased expenses related to unit growth and development, systems improvements and increased ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 18 properties (3,217 rooms) and three properties (696 rooms) left the system in 2005. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company operated international hotels increased 11.3 percent to $117.17. Occupancy for these hotels increased 1.6 percentage points to 73.6 percent, while average daily rates increased 8.9 percent to $159.30. Financial results for our international operations were strong across most regions. In 2005 we experienced strong demand particularly in China, Mexico, the Caribbean and Egypt. The European markets generally remained less robust. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our international brands. The $24 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $26 million increase in base management, incentive management and franchise fees, a $25 million increase in owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in equity results, partially offset by a $46 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses. Incentive fees for 2005 include the recognition of $4 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses increased $25 million reflecting properties acquired in 2005 as well as the impact of the stronger demand environment in 2005. Gains and other income increased $5 million in 2005 versus the prior year primarily reflecting increased cost method joint venture income associated with one new investment. Equity results increased $15 million and primarily reflect a joint venture with significant asset sale activity in 2005 that increased the profitability of the joint venture. In addition, equity results were impacted by the more favorable demand environment in 2005 versus the prior year as well as the mix of investments. General, administrative and other expenses increased $46 million in 2005 and included a $34 million pre tax charge primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of CTF Management Agreements and $5 million of higher expenses associated with our bedding incentive program. Furthermore, in 2005 we also recorded charges totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees, which impacted general, administrative and other expenses. Luxury Lodging includes our The Ritz Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 1,423 $ 1,333 $ 1,263 7 % 6 % Segment results $ 63 $ 45 $ 35 40 % 29 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added three properties (424 rooms) and one property (229 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased 9.7 percent to $209.88. Occupancy for these properties increased 1.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, while average daily rates increased 7.5 percent to $289.50. 44 Table of Contents The $18 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $16 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative and other expenses and $1 million of higher owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $5 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses of $7 million is attributable to a 2005 performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property, partially offset by a $5 million increase in expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development and an increase in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Gains and other income decreased $5 million in 2006 as a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note receivable associated with one property, partially offset by gains totaling $3 million associated with the 2006 sale of a preferred interest in one property. 2005 Compared to 2004 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added two properties (699 rooms) in 2005. In 2005, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased 18.3 percent to $143.30. Occupancy for these properties increased 3.4 percentage points to 71.6 percent, while average daily rates increased 12.7 percent to $200.08. The increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR, driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms. The $10 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a $9 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, a $2 million increase in owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and $13 million of higher gains and other income, partially offset by $16 million of higher general, administrative and other expenses. General, administrative and other expenses in 2005 included a performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property. The 2005 increase in gains and other income versus 2004 is a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note receivable associated with one property and other real estate sale gains. Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Revenues $ 1,840 $ 1,721 $ 1,502 7 % 15 % Segment results $ 280 $ 271 $ 203 3 % 33 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Timeshare contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, which represents sales of timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership products before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting, increased 17 percent over 2005. Timeshare segment revenues of $1,840 million and $1,721 million, in 2006 and 2005, respectively, include interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales, base management fees, resort rental fees and cost reimbursements. Timeshare segment revenues also include $41 million and $38 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income on the Timeshare sales and services revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. The $119 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues reflects a $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $27 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue and $2 million of increased base management fees. The $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed earlier in the Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Segment results of $280 million in 2006 increased $9 million over 2005. The $9 million increase includes an increase of $98 million for Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses and a $2 million increase in base management fees, partially offset by a decline of $72 million in gains and other income, a $16 million increase in general and administrative expenses and $3 million of lower joint venture equity earnings. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $98 million largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the Revenue discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also 45 Table of Contents reflected in the $98 million variance, development revenue net of expenses increased $14 million primarily reflecting lower development expenses in 2006 associated with projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with SOP 04 2, implemented in 2006. Additionally the $98 million variance reflected a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves and $12 million of higher financing revenue net of expense, partially offset by $21 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. The $3 million decline in equity income primarily reflects start up loses associated with several new joint ventures, partially offset by improved performance at other joint ventures. The $72 million decline in gains and other income primarily reflected $69 million of note securitization gains in 2005 versus the recording of note securitization gains in revenue for 2006, while the $16 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflected higher program and joint venture development expenses and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. 2005 Compared to 2004 Timeshare segment revenues were $1,721 million and $1,502 million, in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Timeshare segment revenues include $38 million and $23 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income on the Timeshare sales and services revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. Timeshare contract sales were flat as compared to the prior year, reflecting limited available inventory at several projects in 2005 that were approaching sell out status versus higher contract sales at those projects in the prior year. The favorable segment results compared with 2004 reflect a $51 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue under the percentage of completion accounting, a higher development margin, primarily resulting from the mix of units sold, and higher financing income reflecting a higher average notes receivable portfolio balance in 2005. In addition, compared with 2004, base fees increased $4 million, gains and other income increased $6 million, equity earnings increased $8 million, and general, administrative and other expenses increased $1 million. Improved equity results primarily reflect start up losses in 2004 versus earnings in 2005 associated with one joint venture, and the increase in gains and other income is attributable to note sales that generated gains of $69 million in 2005 compared to $64 million in 2004. In 2005 we also decided to cease development of one land parcel, and we recorded a $7 million charge in conjunction with the write off of the previously capitalized costs that impacted our timeshare direct expenses. Synthetic Fuel See Footnote No. 2, Synthetic Fuel, and Footnote No. 18, Contingencies, in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. The tables that follow detail the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our income from continuing operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Our management evaluates the figures presented in the Before Syn. Fuel Impact columns because management expects the Synthetic Fuel segment will no longer have a material impact on our business after the Internal Revenue Code synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007 and because the presentation reflects the results of our core Lodging operations. Management also believes that these presentations facilitate the comparison of our results with the results of other lodging companies. However, the figures presented in the Before Syn. Fuel Impact columns are non GAAP financial measures, may be calculated and or presented differently than presentations of other companies, and are not alternatives to operating income, total tax (provision) benefit, income from continuing operations, or any other operating measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 2006 Compared to 2005 For 2006, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $165 million versus revenue of $421 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. The $76 million operating loss for 2006 includes a $5 million charge reflecting the write down of assets at the Alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at year end, and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location. Gains and other income (expense) reflects either net earn out payments received or net earn out payments made. In 2006, net earn out payments made totaled $15 million, while in 2005 net earn out payments received totaled $32 million. Lower minority interest income primarily reflects the redemption, early in 2006, of our partners interest in SAFE II. Additionally, lower minority interest income in 2006 also reflects our buy out in the 2006 fourth quarter of our partners interest in SAFE I. Interest costs in 2006 of $4 million reflect the cost of hedges entered into during 2006 in response to high oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits. Income from continuing operations for the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $125 million in 2005 to $5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phase out of tax credits due to high oil prices in 2006. 46 Table of Contents The table below details the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2006 and 2005. 2006 2005 ($ in millions) AsReported Syn.

The $18 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to $125 million from $107 million in 2004 is primarily due to our increased proportion of tax credits through May 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE II facilities that were then under IRS review and higher gains and other income, partially offset by our decreased proportion of tax credits through March 31, 2005, associated with the SAFE I facility that was not under IRS review. In addition, in 2005 production was slightly lower and raw materials prices were higher than in 2004. Gains and other income represents net earn out payments received. Minority interest increased from a benefit of $40 million in 2004 to a benefit of $47 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations. For 2004, minority interest reflects our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)) through year end. For 2005, minority interest represents our partners share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year. 47 Table of Contents The table below details the impact of our Synthetic Fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005 and 2004. 2005 2004 ($ in millions) AsReported Syn.

As noted in Footnote No. 1, Basis of Presentation, under the heading New Accounting Pronouncements, we adopted FAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (FAS No. 123(R)) using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of our 2006 first quarter. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, we did not restate our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods to reflect the impact of FAS No. 123(R). For all share based awards granted after the date we adopted FAS No. 123(R) and for the unvested portion of previously granted share based awards that were outstanding on that date, FAS No. 123(R) requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. Previously, under FAS No. 123 and APB Opinion No. 25, we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB Opinion No. 25) and recognized share based compensation expense for all awards except for our Stock Option Program awards. Share based compensation expense totaled $62 million and $47 million for 2004 and 2005, respectively. Under FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share based compensation expense of $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $168 million at year end 2006, and the weighted average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is two years. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $137 million at year end 2005. FAS No. 123(R) requires that share based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service (the substantive vesting period). In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we showed share based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure only for option awards to retirement eligible employees over the 48 Table of Contents awards stated vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we recorded share based compensation expense for our other awards to retirement eligible employees over the awards stated vesting period. With the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to adoption of FAS No. 123(R) and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No. 123(R). In connection with the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we reviewed, among other things, our forfeiture and volatility assumptions. Estimated volatilities for 2006 were based on the historical share price volatility for a period equal to the stock options or share appreciation rights expected lives, ending on the day of grant, and calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or share appreciation right terms for 2006 were a product of the lattice based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms. In August 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Comprehensive Plan to provide participants the ability, during a limited time frame in 2005, to elect to accelerate the schedule for distribution of certain vested deferred shares. The amendment did not alter the previously established vesting schedule. In 2005, we also changed from using the Black Scholes option pricing method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or share appreciation right on the grant date, to using the binomial valuation method to improve the estimate of fair value. In 2005, we changed the method in which we issue share based awards to our key employees. In prior years, share based compensation for key employees consisted primarily of stock options. Upon consideration of several factors, we began in 2005 to award key employees a combination of stock options and restricted stock units. Therefore, this change resulted in an increase in restricted stock expense. The adoption of FAS No. 123(R) in 2006 resulted in the recognition of incremental share based compensation costs in 2006 of $39 million, a reduction in net income of $25 million (net of tax benefits of $14 million) and a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.06. In accordance with FAS No. 123(R), we present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share based awards as financing cash flows. Prior to the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), we reported the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share based awards as operating cash flows. The adoption of FAS No. 123(R) resulted in a decrease in 2006 of $193 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $193 million in cash flows from financing activities related to excess tax benefits from share based awards. The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share based payment arrangements was $184 million, $125 million, and $206 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the provisions of FAS No. 123(R), the Deferred compensation line on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, a contra equity line representing the amount of unrecognized share based compensation costs, is no longer presented. Accordingly, the amount that had been on the Deferred compensation line at year end 2005 was reversed in the 2006 first quarter through the Additional paid in capital line on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions See the Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle section earlier in this report for information regarding the adoption in 2006 of SOP 04 2. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, which is our 2007 fiscal year, and its provisions are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption. Upon adoption of FIN 48, only tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact that FIN 48 will have on our financial statements. FAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets In March 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (FAS No. 156). FAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities are to be initially measured at fair value. It also allows entities to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. 49 Table of Contents This standard is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006, which is our 2007 fiscal year. We have determined that FAS No. 156 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157). This standard defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No. 157 are required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No. 157 is applied. We are evaluating the impact that FAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. EITF Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums (EITF 06 8). EITF 06 8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No. 66 in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage of completion method. EITF 06 8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2007, which is our 2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06 8, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact that EITF 06 8 will have on our financial statements. Investment in Leveraged Lease At year end 2006, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta), which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, we believe our investment was impaired, and have recorded pre tax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. Expected Land Sale In 1988, the Company, as landlord, entered into a 59 year ground lease with a lessee for land that was improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property; however, currently it is not. The lease contains contractual rental increases over the term of the lease, and annual ground rent on the land currently totals approximately $5 million. The lease also contains a provision that permits the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for a fixed price. The Company and the lessee have had various discussions concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006 second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties, and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the land from the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet to the Assets held for sale caption and recorded a $37 million non cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. Additional amounts may be due us depending on the lessees use of the land subsequent to purchase; however, such amounts will only be recorded if and when paid. Effective Tax Rate Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. Because that program ends with 2007 synthetic fuel production, our synthetic fuel production facilities will not be able to generate credits in future years. As a result, our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly, thereby reducing our after tax profits. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Distribution Services In 2005 and 2004, we had income, net of tax of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, associated with the distribution services business that we exited in 2002. 50 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to a $2.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit. Effective June 6, 2006, we executed an amendment extending the maturity date for $1.955 billion of commitments under this agreement by one year to June 6, 2011. The remaining $45 million commitment still matures on June 6, 2010. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. We classify commercial paper as long term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. At year end 2006 our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.770 billion and reflected borrowing capacity at $2.0 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of $193 million less the letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $108 million and $315 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We issue short term commercial paper in Europe and in the United States. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper in each of these markets, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis, and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash from operations $ 970 $ 837 $ 891 Depreciation expense 155 156 133 Amortization expense 33 28 33 We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2006 presentation. The reclassifications were primarily associated with Timeshare segment inventory that is now a component of Current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and was previously a component of Property and equipment. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 0.8 to one at year end 2006 and 0.6 to one at year end 2005. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital. 51 Table of Contents Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 4.9x 4.3x 4.7x 3.6x 3.2x While our Timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment): ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Timeshare segment development, less the cost of sales $ (83 ) $ 40 $ 93 New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (537 ) (441 ) (459 ) Loan repurchases (55 ) (23 ) (18 ) Note sale gains (77 ) (69 ) (64 ) Note sale proceeds 508 399 312 Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 61 (57 ) 129 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 96 90 94 Other cash (outflows) inflows (17 ) 26 2 Net cash (outflows) inflows from Timeshare segment activity $ (104 ) $ (35 ) $ 89 Our ability to sell Timeshare segment notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes. We might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate, although we do not expect such deterioration. Loans to Timeshare segment owners, including a current portion of $70 million, totaled $386 million at year end 2006. Loans to Timeshare segment owners, including a current portion of $33 million, totaled $344 million at year end 2005. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $529 million in 2006, $780 million in 2005 and $181 million in 2004 included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in Cash from Operations, as noted in that sections narrative, are not reflected in these numbers. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development, subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $798 million in 2006, $298 million in 2005 and $402 million in 2004. In 2006 we closed on the sales of 11 hotels and seven joint venture investments. Cash proceeds of $26 million for one of the hotels sold in 2006 are not reflected in the $798 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency and impacted the other investing activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows rather than dispositions. The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale accounting was achieved in 2006. 52 Table of Contents The sold properties included eight properties purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. (and certain of its affiliates (collectively CTF)). For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see Footnote No. 8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, later in this report. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2006, amounted to $62 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $9 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year end 2006 and $59 million (which included a current portion of $2 million) at year end 2005. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $268 million (which included a current portion of $32 million) at year end 2006 and $274 million (which included a current portion of $13 million) at year end 2005. In 2006 our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $56 million and primarily reflects the repayment of several loans. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures. Cash outflows of $216 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased $96 million in 2006, from $1,737 million to $1,833 million at year end 2006, due to the issuance of $349 million (book value) of Series H Senior Notes (described more fully below), partially offset by a net reduction in commercial paper outstanding of $184 million, and other debt decreases of $69 million. Debt increased $412 million in 2005, from $1,325 million to $1,737 million at year end 2005, due to the issuance of $348 million (book value) of Series F Notes, net commercial paper issuances of $499 million, and other debt increases of $69 million, partially offset by repayment upon maturity of $200 million for the Series B Notes, repayment upon maturity of $275 million for the Series D Notes and the $29 million (book value) debt decrease associated with the Series C and Series E Senior Note exchanges for Series G Senior Notes as described in Footnote No. 12, Long term Debt, in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. In the 2006 second quarter, we sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.200 percent Series H Notes due in 2016 (the Notes). We received net proceeds of approximately $347 million from this offering, after deducting a discount, underwriting fees, and other expenses, and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Notes is paid on June 15 and December 15 of each year, with the first interest payment occurring on December 15, 2006. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2016, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of Note. The Notes were issued under an indenture with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as the Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated November 16, 1998. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2006, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 5.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 6.9 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.7 to one at year end 2005. At the end of 2006, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB+ from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. Share Repurchases. We purchased 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share, 51.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $32.12 per share, and 28.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2004 at an average price of $23.33 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year end 2006, 34.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In April 2006, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 19 percent to $0.0625 per share. 53 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year end 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Debt (1) $ 2,524 $ 108 $ 371 $ 187 $ 1,858 Capital lease obligations (1) 99 9 80 2 8 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,021 122 233 205 461 Non recourse 460 21 35 32 372 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 388 35 71 68 214 Other long term liabilities 65 23 1 41 Total contractual obligations $ 4,557 $ 295 $ 813 $ 495 $ 2,954 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year end 2006: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years ($ in millions) Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 268 $ 19 $ 66 $ 16 $ 167 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 501 61 108 137 195 Total other commercial commitments $ 769 $ 80 $ 174 $ 153 $ 362 Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor listed above include $43 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties. Our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of hotels. The guarantees where we are secondarily liable above include $283 million related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (Sunrise) is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (CNL) is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under these guarantees. The guarantees where we are secondarily liable above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $22 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $218 million. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. CTF has made available 35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $218 million will decline. In addition to the guarantees described above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, from time to time we provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the joint venture 54 Table of Contents owner or our own actions. We have also provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $524 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year end 2006, we had extended approximately $11 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund $5 million by year end 2007. We do not expect to fund the remaining $6 million of commitments, which expire as follows: $1 million within one year; $1 million in three to four years; and $4 million after five years. At year end 2006, we also have commitments to invest $31 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase both North American full service and limited service hotels, which expire as follows: $5 million within one year; $21 million in one to two years; and $5 million after five years. At year end 2006 we also had $108 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year end 2006 totaled $640 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments in relation to our timeshare and lodging operations and self insurance programs. As part of the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. Audit of Employee Stock Ownership Plan Transaction The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently auditing the Companys federal tax returns for the 2000, 2001 and 2002 fiscal years. As part of that audit, the IRS is reviewing a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) feature of the Companys Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the Plan) that was implemented in a transaction (the ESOP Transaction) on June 13, 2000. Principal and interest on the debt related to the transaction was forgiven over a 26 month period as a mechanism for funding Company contributions of elective deferrals and matching contributions to the Plan. The Company claimed federal income tax deductions for the forgiven principal on the debt in the amount of $1 billion over that period, along with forgiven interest on the debt. The benefit related to the tax deductions was reflected in equity and did not flow through the provision for income taxes. Based on discussions with the IRS during the course of the audit, the IRS may seek to disallow some or all of the deductions related to the ESOP Transaction, and may seek to impose other taxes, penalties, and interest, including excise taxes for prohibited transactions under Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In a January 19, 2007, letter to the Company, the U.S. Department of Labor confirmed that it is reviewing the ESOP Transaction. The Company has retained counsel to assist with the audit process and to respond to any claims or assessments the IRS or Department of Labor issues. Although we are early in the process of closing this audit, we do not expect the result of the audit to have a material impact on either equity for any lost deductions or earnings for interest or penalties, if any, related to the ESOP Transaction. 55 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Base management fees $ 62 $ 83 $ 72 Incentive management fees 22 14 8 Cost reimbursements 649 936 802 Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue 3 22 29 Total revenue $ 736 $ 1,055 $ 911 General, administrative and other $ (1 ) $ (19 ) $ (33 ) Reimbursed costs (649 ) (936 ) (802 ) Gains and other income 28 54 19 Interest income 4 31 74 Reversal of provision for loan losses 1 3 Equity in losses Synthetic fuel (28 ) Equity in earnings (losses) Other 3 36 (14 ) Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Current assets accounts and notes receivable $ 76 $ 47 Contract acquisition costs 34 26 Cost method investments 45 166 Equity method investments 332 349 Loans to equity method investees 27 36 Long term deferred tax asset, net 4 19 Current liabilities: Accounts payable (2 ) Other payables and accruals (2 ) (43 ) Other long term liabilities (13 ) (19 ) JWM Family Enterprises, L.P. JWM Family Enterprises, L.P. (Family Enterprises) is a Delaware limited partnership which is beneficially owned and controlled by members of the family of J.W. Marriott, Jr., the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, including John W. Marriott III, the Companys Vice Chairman, who is Chief Executive Officer of Family Enterprises, and J.W. Marriott, Jr. himself. In July 2006, the Company sold the Dallas, Texas, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts brand hotel to Family Enterprises for a sale price of approximately $38 million and recognized a gain of $1 million on the sale. The Company originally acquired the hotel from a third party in June 2005. The sale to Family Enterprises resulted from a competitive auction process involving other unrelated bidders in which Family Enterprises submitted the most competitive bid. 56 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $92 million. We had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year end 2005, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $184 million. We had a $103 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired 57 Table of Contents loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2006 and 2005, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $138 million and $182 million, respectively. Loans to Timeshare Owners In conjunction with the adoption of SOP 04 2, we now record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogenous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical uncollectibles for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past six years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each years sales over the life of those notes. At year end 2006, our allowance for credit losses associated with Loans to timeshare owners totaled $29 million. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices, and for our synthetic fuel business, oil prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of $107 million at year end 2006 and are accounted for as available for sale securities under FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year end 2006 we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010. Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $209 million, and they expire through 2022. Option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2007. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was approximately $47 million, and they expire throughout 2007. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was $217 million and they expire throughout 2007. Oil price hedges to manage the volatility associated with oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits in 2007. The hedges cover 5 million barrels of oil and expire on December 31, 2007. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts had a dollar notional equivalent of $43 million and they expire throughout 2007. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year end 2006: ($ in millions) Maturities by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
