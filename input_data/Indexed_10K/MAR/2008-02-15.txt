Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,999 properties (535,093 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year end 2007 and include 21 home and condominium projects (1,916 units) for which we manage the related owners associations. In addition, we provided 2,156 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 19 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz Carlton Residential) and Timeshare segment projects (Ritz Carlton Club Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential products distinctive. Generally, lodging demand remained strong through 2007, driven by continued strength associated with worldwide business travel. In general, luxury, international, and full service properties experienced stronger demand than limited service properties. Strong demand enabled us to increase rates at the property level, which resulted in solid year over year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year over year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines. In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. Demand for our brands is strong in many markets around the world. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR increases in 2007, as compared to the year ago period, were particularly strong in Dallas, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Internationally, 2007 RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Our approach to improving property level and above property productivity has benefited our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees. Driving room rate improvement, benchmarking successful performance, and leveraging our size have all contributed to property level margin improvements and higher incentive management fees to us. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary Web site, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property level reservations via this cost efficient channel. Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information rich and easy to use Web site, a multi channel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. In 2007, we announced our agreement with the Nickelodeon division of Viacom, Inc. and Miller Global Properties, LLC to co develop a new lodging resort brand and concept for travelers seeking fun and adventure, Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott. Also during 2007, we announced our agreement with Ian Schrager to create a global boutique lifestyle hotel brand Edition on a large scale. See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report for important information regarding forward looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. 22 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Continuing Operations Revenues 2007 Compared to 2006 Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property level margins higher. Year over year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007, as compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate, offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, as compared to the recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006. The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system. 2006 Compared to 2005 Revenues increased by $866 million (8 percent) to $11,995 million in 2006 from $11,129 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property level margins higher. Year over year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our purchase, early in the second half of 2005, of 13 formerly managed properties from CTF Holdings Ltd. (CTF). See Footnote No. 8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, later in this report for a detailed description of the CTF transaction. As planned, eight of the CTF properties were sold during 2006: one property was sold in the first quarter; five properties were sold in the second quarter; and two properties were sold in the third quarter. 23 Table of Contents Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $90 million (6 percent) over the prior year. The increase largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed later in the Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Additionally, financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year, as did villa rental revenue. Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell out. The $866 million increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms) and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms) to our system in 2006, net of properties exiting the system. Operating Income 2007 Compared to 2006 Operating income increased by $101 million (9 percent) to $1,188 million in 2007 from $1,087 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees of $204 million, partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses of $91 million, lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $7 million, and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $5 million. The combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees increase of $204 million reflected strong RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property level margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. As compared to the year ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $91 million (13 percent) from $677 million in 2006 to $768 million in 2007. In 2007, we incurred a $35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Labor examination of our employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) feature of our Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the Plan). See Footnote No. 3, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, the increase was attributable to, among other things, increased costs related to our unit growth, development and systems improvements, increased litigation expenses, and increased other administrative costs. Also unfavorably impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, when compared to the prior year, were foreign exchange losses totaling $2 million in 2007 as compared to foreign exchange gains of $6 million in 2006 and $1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the year ago period reflected $6 million of guarantee reversals. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were $4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 and a $9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required. Increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters. Of the $91 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $78 million increase was unallocated. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of $15 million reversal of contingency reserves and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. The $5 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected $19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, as compared to $26 million in 2006. Depreciation charges totaling $8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned 24 Table of Contents property that was reclassified from held for sale to held and used during 2007 as compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of $7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held and used. Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was the favorable impact of $4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties. 2006 Compared to 2005 Operating income increased by $388 million (56 percent) to $1,087 million in 2006 from $699 million in the prior year. The increase in 2006 is, in part, due to a combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fee increase of $197 million, reflecting stronger RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property level margin improvements. Stronger owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed $17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the CTF hotel properties acquired in 2005. The $17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of $20 million, a $12 million increase in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received and $5 million of higher other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower land lease income. Also reflected in the year over year change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling $7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two properties that were reclassified in 2006 from held for sale to held and used. The depreciation charges totaling $7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously classified as held and used. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased by $98 million (38 percent) in 2006 and largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As noted earlier in the Revenue discussion, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million favorable variance, development revenue net of expenses increased by $14 million and financing, services and other revenue net of expenses increased by $7 million. Increased development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions (SOP 04 2), implemented in 2006. Increased financing, services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves in 2006. As compared to the year ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $76 million (10 percent) to $677 million in 2006 from $753 million in 2005. In 2005, we incurred general, administrative, and other expenses of $94 million primarily due to the non cash write off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements resulting from the CTF transaction. We also incurred general, administrative, and other expenses of $30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program. We implemented the bedding incentive program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year end 2005. Further impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, 2005 reflected hotel operating agreement performance cure payments of $15 million versus a $6 million similar payment in 2006, and 2005 also reflected $9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional $5 million of guarantee charges in 2006. Additionally, impacting the year over year general, administrative, and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling $6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of $5 million in 2005. Also impacting the year over year change in general, administrative, and other expenses, an additional $22 million reflects unit growth, systems improvements, higher program and joint venture development expenses, and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Development expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by $15 million and $5 million, respectively. As noted under the heading New Accounting Standards in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, section of our 2006 Form 10 K, we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with share based compensation. This new standard resulted in incremental general, administrative, and other expenses of $39 million versus 2005, primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general, administrative, and other expenses. Of the $76 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $124 million was attributable to our Lodging segments and a $48 million increase was unallocated. 25 Table of Contents Gains and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005: ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Timeshare note sale gains $ $ $ 69 Gains on sales of real estate and other 39 26 34 Loss on expected land sale (37 ) Other note sale/repayment gains 1 2 25 Gains on forgiveness of debt 12 Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments 31 68 7 Income from cost method joint ventures 14 15 14 $ 97 $ 74 $ 149 2007 Compared to 2006 The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives. The loans were forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 comprised $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee which generated a gain of $25 million. 2006 Compared to 2005 Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 represents $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture and other investments and $25 million of income associated with the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee. As further explained in the earlier Revenues discussion for 2006, Timeshare segment note sale gains of $77 million in 2006 are presented in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. Interest Expense 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest expense increased by $60 million (48 percent) to $184 million for 2007 from $124 million in 2006. Of the $60 million increase over 2006, $78 million was due to: $26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance, primarily due to increased share repurchases and the ESOP settlement payments, and related interest rates; $25 million of interest associated with our Series H Senior Notes issuance which occurred late in 2006 and our Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances which occurred in 2007; a charge of $13 million in 2007 related to the ESOP settlement; charges totaling $53 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners behalf including Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self insurance programs; interest totaling $5 million associated with other additional debt; and the write off of $2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007. See Footnote No. 3, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. The increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the year ago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting the $78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an $18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects. 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest expense increased by $18 million (17 percent) to $124 million in 2006 from $106 million in 2005. Included within interest expense for 2006 and 2005 are charges totaling $46 million and $29 million, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows, in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners behalf. The increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Interest expense also increased in 2006, due to our June 2005 Series F Notes issuance, our June 2006 Series H Notes issuance, and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates. Partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff, at maturity, of both our Series D Notes in April 2005 and Series B Notes in November 2005, and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Notes for lower interest rate Series G Notes in 2005. 26 Table of Contents Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $11 million (22 percent) to $38 million in 2007 from $49 million in 2006, primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us, partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings. Loan loss provisions increased by $20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a $12 million charge associated with one property and a $5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines, Inc. (Delta) lease versus loan loss reversals of $3 million in 2006. For additional information regarding the Delta lease investment write off, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption later in this report. Our tax provision increased by $61 million (16 percent) from a tax provision of $380 million in 2006 to a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected higher pretax income from our Lodging segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007, primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries. Increased taxes also reflect a charge for a German legislative tax change in 2007, which had a one time impact and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. See Footnote No. 3, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. 2006 Compared to 2005 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $30 million (38 percent) to $49 million in 2006 from $79 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us in 2005. Loan loss provisions decreased by $31 million versus the prior year reflecting the reversal of loan loss provisions totaling $3 million in 2006 compared to a charge of $17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our Delta lease, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption later in this report for additional information and an $11 million loan loss provision in 2005 associated with one property. Our tax provision totaled $380 million in 2006 compared to a tax provision of $284 million in 2005. The difference of $96 million is attributable to higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pretax income from our lodging operations. Equity in Earnings 2007 Compared to 2006 Equity in earnings increased by $12 million from $3 million in 2006 to $15 million in 2007 and reflected the mix of investments, compared to 2006, and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007, for one joint venture, the reopening of a hotel, late in 2006, in Mexico, which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in Hawaii. 2006 Compared to 2005 The $33 million decline from earnings of $36 million in 2005 to earnings of $3 million in 2006, attributable to our equity investments, reflected the recognition in 2005 of $30 million of equity earnings from the sale of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests. In addition, since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures. Income from Continuing Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Compared to 2006, income from continuing operations decreased by $15 million (2 percent) to $697 million in 2007, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.10 (6 percent) to $1.75. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($91 million), higher taxes ($61 million), higher interest expense ($60 million), higher loan loss provision ($20 million), lower interest income ($11 million), lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($7 million), and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($5 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were higher fee income ($204 million), higher gains and other income ($23 million), higher equity investment results ($12 million), and a higher minority interest benefit ($1 million). 27 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Compared to 2005, income from continuing operations increased by $169 million (31 percent) to $712 million in 2006, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.48 (41 percent) to $1.65. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income ($197 million), higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($98 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($76 million), a lower loan loss provision ($31 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($17 million), and lower minority interest expense ($2 million). Partially offsetting these favorable variances, were significantly higher taxes ($96 million), lower gains and other income ($75 million), lower equity investment results ($33 million), lower interest income ($30 million), and higher interest expense ($18 million). Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 2006 Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04 2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to exclude accounting for real estate time sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04 2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04 2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The adoption of SOP 04 2 in 2006, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statements of Income, resulted in a non cash after tax charge of $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). The pretax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that, for the 20 year period from 2008 through 2027, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $1.7 billion. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada; North American Limited Service Lodging, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada; International Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada; Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide; and Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide under Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club. In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. 28 Table of Contents In addition to the brands noted above, in 2007 we announced our new brand of family friendly resorts and spas, Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels, Edition. At year end 2007, no properties were yet open under either brand. In 2006, we analyzed our internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency and, as part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting. Accordingly, we now report five operating segments, and no longer allocate indirect administrative expenses to our segments. We reflect this revised segment reporting throughout this report for all periods presented, and present historical figures in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. See also the Form 8 K that we filed on March 19, 2007, furnishing quarterly Revenues and Income from Continuing Operations for each of 2006 and 2005 in the new segment format. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, indirect general, administrative, and other expenses, or income taxes. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segments operations. We also allocate other gains or losses as well as equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative, and other expenses to each of our segments. Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full Service, North American Limited Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment, and our organizational and management reporting structure. 29 Table of Contents Total Lodging Products by Segment At year end 2007, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,156 corporate housing rental units): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non U.S. Total U.S. Non U.S. Total North American Full Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 309 12 321 121,842 4,556 126,398 Marriott Conference Centers 13 13 3,476 3,476 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 15 15 7,901 7,901 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts 70 3 73 25,942 1,034 26,976 Renaissance ClubSport 1 1 175 175 408 15 423 159,336 5,590 164,926 North American Limited Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 693 16 709 96,759 2,847 99,606 Fairfield Inn 529 7 536 46,930 741 47,671 SpringHill Suites 176 1 177 20,445 124 20,569 Residence Inn 528 17 545 62,805 2,536 65,341 TownePlace Suites 141 141 14,122 14,122 2,067 41 2,108 241,061 6,248 247,309 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 144 148 2,742 39,396 42,138 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 1 22 23 387 8,244 8,631 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts 67 67 21,783 21,783 Courtyard 58 58 11,174 11,174 Fairfield Inn 1 1 206 206 Residence Inn 1 1 75 75 Marriott Executive Apartments 18 18 2,905 2,905 Ramada International 2 2 332 332 5 313 318 3,129 84,115 87,244 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz Carlton 36 34 70 11,627 9,978 21,605 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts 2 2 117 117 The Ritz Carlton Residential (2) 16 1 17 1,614 93 1,707 52 37 89 13,241 10,188 23,429 Timeshare Lodging Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 37 9 46 8,987 1,909 10,896 The Ritz Carlton Club Fractional 5 2 7 283 105 388 The Ritz Carlton Club Residential (2) 2 1 3 138 6 144 Grand Residences by Marriott Fractional 1 1 2 199 49 248 Grand Residences by Marriott Residential (1), (2) 1 1 65 65 Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club 2 2 444 444 48 13 61 10,116 2,069 12,185 Total 2,580 419 2,999 426,883 108,210 535,093 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

We consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. Company operated house profit margin is the ratio of property level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property level revenue. This ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. 31 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 We added 203 properties (29,200 rooms) and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) exited the system in 2007, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units). Total segment financial results increased by $173 million (12 percent) to $1,588 million in 2007 from $1,415 million in 2006, and total segment revenues increased by $979 million to $12,909 million in 2007, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,930 million in 2006. The results, as compared to the prior year, reflect a $204 million (17 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees from $1,224 million in 2006 to $1,428 million in 2007, a $16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments, and a $1 million minority interest benefit. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease of $18 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $10 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $7 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth, drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million (31 percent) during 2007, reflecting the impact of strong room rate increases and property level margin improvements associated with productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years and base management fees included $6 million and $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years, received in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, 67 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 62 percent in 2006. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties increased by 6.0 percent over 2006, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased by 6.2 percent over 2006. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 8.4 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 6.5 percent (7.6 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased by 7.0 percent. As compared to 2006, 2007 worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins increased by 150 basis points, while North American company operated house profit margins improved by 160 basis points versus 2006. For 2007, as compared to 2006, house profit per available room (HP PAR) at our full service managed properties in North America increased by 10.6 percent. HP PAR at our North American limited service managed properties increased by 8.9 percent, and worldwide HP PAR for all our brands increased by 11.0 percent on a constant dollar basis. 2006 Compared to 2005 We added 136 properties (23,466 rooms) and 45 properties (8,616 rooms) left the system in 2006. Most of the properties that left the system were limited service properties. Total segment financial results increased by $314 million (29 percent) to $1,415 million in 2006 from $1,101 million in 2005, and total segment revenues increased by $857 million to $11,930 million in 2006, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,073 million in 2005. The results as compared to the prior year reflect a $197 million (19 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees from $1,027 million in 2005 to $1,224 million in 2006, $124 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $8 million of increased owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $98 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, and an increase in minority interest of $2 million, partially offset by $78 million of lower gains and other income and a $37 million decline in earnings associated with equity investments. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million (40 percent) during 2006, reflecting the impact of strong room rate improvement and property level margin improvements. Incentive management fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, 32 Table of Contents respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. In 2006, 62 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 51 percent in 2005. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased by 9.1 percent over 2005 and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties, increased by 10.5 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased by 11.1 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 9.4 percent while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased by 9.5 percent. In addition, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins increased by 230 basis points, while North American company operated house profit margins improved by 240 basis points versus 2005. For 2006, as compared to 2005, HP PAR at our full service managed properties in North America increased by 16.3 percent. HP PAR at our North American limited service managed properties increased by 12.6 percent, and worldwide HP PAR for all our brands increased by 15.4 percent on a constant dollar basis. Lodging Development We opened 203 properties, totaling 29,200 rooms, across our brands in 2007 and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units). Highlights of the year included: Converting 26 properties (5,618 rooms), or 18 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 21 percent of the rooms were located in international markets; Opening approximately 16 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; Adding 156 properties (17,517 rooms) to our North American Limited Service brands; and Opening two new Marriott Vacation Club properties in the West Indies on the island of St. Kitts, and the U.S. Virgin Islands on the island of St. Thomas, as well as one new Ritz Carlton Club and residences property in San Francisco, California. We currently have more than 125,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add over 30,000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2008. We expect to remove approximately 5,000 rooms from our system during the 2008 full year. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report. Statistics. The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full Service and North American Limited Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow).

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Segment revenues $ 5,476 $ 5,196 $ 5,116 5 % 2 % Segment results $ 478 $ 455 $ 349 5 % 30 % 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 13 properties (3,947 rooms) and six properties (2,853 rooms) left the system. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties increased by 6.8 percent to $126.92. Occupancy for these properties increased by 0.9 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $174.54. The $23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a $65 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, partially offset by a $22 million decline in gains and other income and a $20 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. The $65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger RevPAR and property level margins, driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $2 million, both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina, and no similar fees in 2006. Additionally, 2006 reflected the recognition of $3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007. Gains and other income was $22 million lower in 2007, as compared to 2006, and reflected a $37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straight line rent receivable, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $34 million of lower other gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. The $34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate, while 2007 reflects limited similar activity. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $20 million and reflected properties sold and $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006, compared to $3 million of such fees received in 2007. General, administrative, and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged as compared to 2006 primarily reflecting $5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the write off of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system. 2006 Compared to 2005 In 2006, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,971 rooms) and six properties (1,604 rooms) left the system. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties increased by 8.5 percent to $121.10. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points, and average daily rates increased by 9.0 percent to $167.27. Compared to the prior year, our 2006 results reflect a $59 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees. The increase in fees is largely due to stronger RevPAR, driven primarily by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, higher food and beverage, meeting room rental and other revenue, and productivity improvements, all of which favorably impacted property level house profit margins. The growth in the number of rooms, year over year, also contributed to the increase in fees. Incentive management fees included $10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior periods earnings but not earned and due until they were recognized. Similarly, base management fees for 2006 included $4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a $10 million hotel agreement termination fee associated with one property, partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees. 40 Table of Contents General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $69 million as a result of, among other things, a $60 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction, more fully discussed in the previous Operating Income discussion, as well as expenses of $14 million in 2005 related to our bedding incentive program, partially offset by increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development, systems improvements, and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. In 2005, general, administrative, and other expenses included $3 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments associated with one property. In 2006, general, administrative, and other expenses included a $5 million hotel management agreement performance cure payment. Gains and other income was $3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties. Gains and other income for 2006 reflected a $37 million non cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we own and lease, as further described in the Expected Land Sale caption in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2006 Form 10 K. Equity results decreased by $19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006, offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment. North American Limited Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Segment revenues $ 2,198 $ 2,060 $ 1,886 7 % 9 % Segment results $ 461 $ 380 $ 303 21 % 25 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 156 properties (17,517 rooms) and 16 properties (1,853 rooms) left the system in 2007. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties increased by 4.8 percent to $89.18. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $122.63. The $81 million increase in segment results, as compared to 2006, primarily reflects an $83 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $2 million increase in gains and other income, and a $2 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. In 2007, we recognized $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years results but not earned and due until 2007 as compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006. The additional increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which increased base management and franchise fees, and to productivity improvements, which increased property level margins and incentive management fees. Additionally, growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of $6 million received in 2007, which were associated with properties, primarily our Fairfield Inn brand, that left our system and $1 million of similar fees in 2006. The $11 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the write off of $3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs. 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 91 properties (11,329 rooms) and 28 properties (3,647 rooms) left the system in 2006. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. 41 Table of Contents In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties increased by 9.1 percent to $84.41. Occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 73.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 10.4 percent to $115.24. The $77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $77 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, $27 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $6 million of increased equity results, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses and a $19 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Stronger performance at our renovated Courtyard properties, versus nonrenovated properties, also contributed to the increase in segment results over the prior year. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale, late in 2005, of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard hotels, partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand. The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $11 million associated with our bedding incentive program, a $6 million litigation charge and a $3 million guarantee charge. Improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006, new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the Courtyard Joint Venture through the first quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter. For additional information regarding the Courtyard Joint Venture, see the Courtyard Joint Venture caption in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2005 Form 10 K. Gains and other income decreased by $19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated gains and other income of $17 million, a $10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment, before maturity, to us of the loan we made to the Courtyard Joint Venture, partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of $4 million in 2006 and increased income of $4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures.

In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased by 8.2 percent to $127.44. Occupancy for these properties increased by 0.8 percentage points to 75.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.0 percent to $168.30. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The $34 million increase in segment results in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflects a $27 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, an $11 million increase in gains and other income, and a $3 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $7 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Incentive management fees included $2 million for 2007 that were calculated based on prior periods earnings, but not earned and due until recognized, compared to $10 million of similar fees in 2006. The increase in fees is largely due to strong demand and higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. The $11 million increase in gains and other income reflects higher gains in 2007 on real estate sales, as compared to the year ago period, offset by lower gains on the sale of joint ventures. The $7 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses from 2006 is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained flat primarily reflecting hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees of $8 million received in 2007 and $12 million of similar fees in 2006, entirely offset by the improved performance of our owned and leased properties in 2007. 42 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our International Lodging segment, we added 22 properties (5,242 rooms) and 10 properties (3,136 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased by 11.1 percent to $114.61. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.2 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 9.4 percent to $153.99. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. China, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and certain Middle Eastern countries all had strong RevPAR increases. The $104 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $43 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, $37 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, $29 million of increased owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses, and a $15 million increase in gains and other income, partially offset by $20 million of lower equity results. Incentive management fees included $10 million and $4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods earnings, but not earned and due until the periods they were recognized. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms. Equity results decreased by $20 million in 2006 versus 2005 and reflected the recognition in 2005 of $14 million in equity earnings from a joint venture as a result of the ventures sale of a hotel and $4 million of increased equity losses in 2006 associated with one joint ventures hotel that was closed for renovation. The increase of $29 million in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects $19 million of improved results for owned and leased properties primarily due to the stronger demand environment and an increase of $12 million for hotel agreement termination fees for several properties. The $19 million improvement in owned and leased results also reflects the impact of a $5 million charge in 2006 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from held for sale to held and used as it was not sold within one year of its classification as held for sale, as had been expected. The $15 million increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of various joint ventures throughout 2006, partially offset by a decrease in other income associated with one of the sold cost method joint venture investments. The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $37 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling $5 million associated with our bedding incentive program as well as a $34 million charge in 2005 associated with the CTF transaction discussed more fully in the previous operating income disclosure. Also impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, in 2005 we recorded expenses totaling $6 million associated with two guarantees and 2006 reflected $7 million of increased expenses related to unit growth and development, systems improvements, and increased ordinary costs such as wages and benefits.

In addition, we added three residential products (347 units) in 2007. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased by 9.4 percent to $227.87. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.6 percent to $314.36. The $9 million increase in segment results, as compared to 2006, reflected a $20 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, partially offset by $3 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of lower equity joint venture results. Fiscal year 2006 included $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, as compared to no similar fees in 2007. The increase in fees over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR driven by rate increases, new properties added to 43 Table of Contents the system, the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years, the year over year favorable impact associated with the reopening, late in 2006, of two properties impacted by the same aforementioned hurricanes and increased branding fees. The $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. The $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges totaling $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from held and used, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale, partially offset by a favorable $3 million impact associated with the opening of a new leased property in 2007. 2006 Compared to 2005 Across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added three properties (424 rooms) and one property (229 rooms) left the system in 2006. In 2006, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased by 9.7 percent to $209.88. Occupancy for these properties increased by 1.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.5 percent to $289.50. The $18 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a $16 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $1 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $5 million of lower gains and other income. The increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which impacted property level house profits and, to a lesser extent, to productivity improvements, the growth in the number of rooms, and the recognition of $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006. The decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses of $7 million is attributable to a 2005 hotel management agreement performance termination cure payment of $12 million associated with one property, partially offset by a $5 million increase in expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development and an increase in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Gains and other income decreased by $5 million in 2006 as a result of a $9 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity of a note receivable associated with one property, partially offset by gains totaling $3 million associated with the 2006 sale of a preferred interest in one property. 44 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands.

Timeshare contract sales decreased by 14 percent as compared to 2006, reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales, partially offset by increased timeshare sales. Contract sales in 2006 reflected particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our San Francisco and Kapalua, Hawaii products. The $225 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues from $1,840 million to $2,065 million reflected a $170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue, a $46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $9 million of increased base management fees. The increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue. Higher base management fees reflect the growing number of timeshare resorts under management. Timeshare segment revenues include $50 million and $41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and note sale gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the Timeshare sales and services revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. Segment results of $306 million in 2007 increased by $26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased base management fees, $12 million of increased joint venture equity results, and $11 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, partially offset by the $15 million reversal of contingency reserves in 2006 and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, 45 Table of Contents offset by several other projects that were approaching sell out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, as compared to 2006. As compared to the prior year, the $12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflects strong demand in 2007 for our products in Kapalua, Hawaii and start up costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007. 2006 Compared to 2005 Timeshare contract sales increased by 17 percent in 2006. Timeshare segment revenues of $1,840 million and $1,721 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, include $41 million and $38 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, of interest income, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the Timeshare sales and services revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. The $119 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues reflects a $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $27 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $2 million of increased base management fees. The $90 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed earlier in the Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Segment results of $280 million in 2006 increased by $9 million over 2005. The $9 million increase includes an increase of $98 million for Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses and a $2 million increase in base management fees, partially offset by a decline of $72 million in gains and other income, a $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and $3 million of lower joint venture equity earnings. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $98 million largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. Note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Also reflected in the $98 million variance, development revenue net of expenses increased by $14 million primarily reflecting lower development expenses in 2006 associated with projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with SOP 04 2, implemented in 2006. Additionally, the $98 million variance reflected a $15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves and $12 million of higher financing revenue net of expense, partially offset by $21 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. The $3 million decline in equity income primarily reflects start up losses associated with several new joint ventures, partially offset by improved performance at other joint ventures. The $72 million decline in gains and other income primarily reflected $69 million of note securitization gains in 2005 versus the recording of note securitization gains in revenue for 2006, while the $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher program and joint venture development expenses, and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta, which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007. We have no remaining exposure related to this historical investment. Effective Tax Rate Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. As we exited the business in November 2007 our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly, thereby reducing our after tax profits. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The tax credits provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 2, Discontinued Operations, and Footnote No. 17, Contingencies, in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. 46 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 For 2007, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $352 million versus revenue of $165 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting higher production in 2007. Production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $5 million in 2006 to a loss of $1 million in 2007, primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007, partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and, on the increased operating losses, a higher tax benefit. Results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 70.71 percent phase out of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phase out that was estimated at year end 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006. Additionally, results in 2007 reflect interest costs of $8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. 2006 Compared to 2005 For 2006, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $165 million versus revenue of $421 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined from $125 million in 2005 to $5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phase out of tax credits at year end 2006 due to high oil prices in 2006. Additionally, results in 2006 reflect interest costs of $4 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. Segment results for 2006 also reflect a $5 million charge reflecting the write down of assets at the Alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at year end and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location. Distribution Services In 2005, we had income, net of tax, of $1 million associated with the distribution services business that we exited in 2002. New Accounting Standards FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which seeks to standardize practices associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 of $155 million as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid in capital on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. See Footnote No. 3, Income Taxes, for additional information. Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 We adopted FASBs FAS No. 156 on December 30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities initially be measured at fair value, if practicable. It also allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FAS No. 156, of $1 million, net of tax, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on December 30, 2006. See Footnote No. 11, Asset Securitizations, for additional information. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards EITF Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums (EITF 06 8). EITF 06 8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No. 66 in order to recognize profit under the 47 Table of Contents percentage of completion method. EITF 06 8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06 8, if any, will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We do not expect the impact of adoption of EITF 06 8 to be material. FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157). This standard defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No. 157 must be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No. 157 is applied. In November 2007, the FASB agreed to partially defer the effective date, for one year, of FAS No. 157, for non financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS No. 159). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any financial assets or liabilities at the present time. EITF Issue No. 07 6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy Sell Clause In December 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 07 6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy Sell Clause (EITF 07 6). EITF 07 6 clarifies whether a buy sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07 6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit sharing, leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy sell clause performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect EITF 07 6 to have a material impact on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS No. 141(R)). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51 (FAS No. 160). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the 48 Table of Contents parent and its non controlling interest. FAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. 49 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and supports our commercial paper program. On May 14, 2007, we amended and restated this facility to increase the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from $2 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the expiration of the facility from 2011 to 2012. The material terms of the amended and restated credit agreement were otherwise unchanged. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating. We do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility. We classify commercial paper as long term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. At year end 2007, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2.151 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion under the credit facility, plus our cash balance of $332 million, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $96 million, and less $585 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility. We consider these resources, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. We periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. We issue short term commercial paper in the United States and in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then current demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets, as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to long term committed credit facilities. If conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Cash from operations $ 778 $ 970 $ 840 Depreciation expense 162 155 156 Amortization expense 35 33 28 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.2 to 1.0 at year end 2007 and 1.3 to 1.0 at year end 2006. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts, and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 4.3x 5.3x 4.6x 4.9x 3.9x 50 Table of Contents While our Timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment): ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Timeshare segment development (in excess of) less than cost of sales $ (55 ) $ (83 ) $ 40 New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (559 ) (537 ) (441 ) Note repurchases (30 ) (55 ) (23 ) Financially reportable sales (in excess of) less than closed sales (16 ) 61 (57 ) Note sale gains (81 ) (77 ) (69 ) Note sale proceeds 515 508 399 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 106 96 90 Other cash (outflows) inflows (35 ) (17 ) 26 Net cash outflows from Timeshare segment activity $ (155 ) $ (104 ) $ (35 ) Our ability to sell Timeshare segment notes is dependent upon continued liquidity within the asset backed and broader structured credit markets. While the recent dislocation in the capital markets has resulted in a general reduction in liquidity for new asset backed issuances, we believe that demand remains sufficient for our continued sale of Timeshare segment notes, albeit at somewhat less favorable terms. If the liquidity of the markets decreases further, or the underlying quality of any future Timeshare segment notes we originate were to deteriorate, we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales, although we do not expect such deterioration. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. Capital expenditures of $671 million in 2007, $529 million in 2006, and $780 million in 2005 included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in Cash from Operations, as noted in that sections narrative, are not reflected in these numbers. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. At the end of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential interests. Subsequent to year end 2007, we purchased our partners interest in the joint venture. Concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land from our partner as well. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $37 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $74 million and $37 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $745 million in 2007, $798 million in 2006, and $298 million in 2005. In 2007, we closed on the sales of 13 properties and five joint venture investments. Cash proceeds of $90 million for a parcel of land sold in 2007 are not reflected in the $745 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency. Accordingly, these proceeds impacted the Other investing activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than Dispositions. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2007, amounted to $75 million. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled 51 Table of Contents $7 million (which included a current portion of $4 million) at year end 2007 and $9 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year end 2006. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $206 million (which included a current portion of $18 million) at year end 2007 and $268 million (which included a current portion of $32 million) at year end 2006. In 2007 our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, declined by $64 million and primarily reflects the repayment or sale of several loans and the reserve against an underperforming loan. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in two joint ventures. Cash outflows of $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures. Cash outflows of $216 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC (Whitbread). For additional information regarding Whitbread see Footnote No. 10, Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture in our 2006 Form 10 K. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased by $1,132 million in 2007, from $1,833 million to $2,965 million at year end 2007, due to the issuance of $346 million (book value at issuance) of Series I Senior Notes (described more fully below), the issuance of $397 million (book value at issuance) of Series J Senior Notes (described more fully below), a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $270 million and other debt increases of $119 million. Debt increased by $96 million in 2006, from $1,737 million to $1,833 million at year end 2006, due to the issuance of $349 million (book value at issuance) of Series H Senior Notes, partially offset by a net reduction in commercial paper outstanding of $184 million, and other debt decreases of $69 million. In 2007, we issued $350 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent Series I Senior Notes due 2017. The offering of the notes closed on June 25, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes will be paid on June 15 and December 15 of each year, and commenced on December 15, 2007. The notes will mature on June 15, 2017, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note. Also in 2007, we issued $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.625 percent Series J Senior Notes due 2013. The offering of the notes closed on October 19, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $396 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes will be paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year, and commenced on February 15, 2008. The notes will mature on February 15, 2013, and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note. Both the Series I Senior Notes and the Series J Senior Notes were issued under an indenture with The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, dated as of November 16, 1998. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2007, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 6.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 5.9 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year end 2007. At the end of 2007, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. Subsequent to year end 2007, on January 15, 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series E Senior Notes. Share Repurchases. We purchased 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share, 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share, and 51.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2005 at an average price of $32.12 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year end 2007, 33.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 2 percent to $0.0750 per share. 52 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year end 2007: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 3,855 $ 300 $ 405 $ 596 $ 2,554 Capital lease obligations (1) 12 1 2 2 7 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,394 121 256 219 798 Non recourse 439 21 30 30 358 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 166 30 60 43 33 Other long term liabilities 110 3 14 5 88 Total contractual obligations $ 5,976 $ 476 $ 767 $ 895 $ 3,838 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year end 2007 was $132 million and is not reflected in the Contractual Obligations table. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52 week period. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. See Footnote No. 3, Income Taxes, for additional information. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year end 2007: Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 315 $ 21 $ 89 $ 49 $ 156 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 322 46 91 112 73 Total other commercial commitments $ 637 $ 67 $ 180 $ 161 $ 229 Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor of $315 million listed in the preceding table include $41 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties. The guarantees where we are secondarily liable of $322 million in the preceding table include $245 million of guarantees that expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (Sunrise) is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (CNL), which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the guarantees. The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $7 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $77 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of the 2023 calendar year. CTF has made available 35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately 7 million [$11 million] remained at year end 2007). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $77 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. Furthermore, in addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 53 Table of Contents 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. We have also provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $80 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 25 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. The carrying value of the liabilities associated with these two project completion guarantees is $7 million. In addition to the guarantees described above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year end 2007, we had extended approximately $4 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $2 million within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire after five years. At year end 2007, we also have commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North American full service and limited service properties or purchase or develop hotel anchored mixed use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $14 million in one to two years; and $30 million in three to five years. As of year end 2007, we also have a commitment to invest up to $25 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $12 million and have $13 million remaining that we expect to fund within one year. As of year end 2007, we also had a commitment to invest up to $29 million (20 million) in a joint venture in which we are an investor. We currently do not expect to fund under this commitment. At year end 2007 we had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of year end 2007 totaled $468 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. 54 Table of Contents RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount of consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled $9 million at year end 2007. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Base management fees $ 56 $ 62 $ 83 Franchise fees 1 2 2 Incentive management fees 26 22 14 Cost reimbursements 510 649 936 Owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue 19 Total revenue $ 593 $ 735 $ 1,054 General, administrative, and other $ (4 ) $ (1 ) $ (19 ) Reimbursed costs (510 ) (649 ) (936 ) Gains and other income 25 28 54 Interest expense (1 ) (1 ) Interest income 4 4 31 (Provision for) reversal of provision for loan losses (12 ) 1 Equity in earnings 15 3 36 Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) At Year end2007 At Year end2006 Current assets accounts and notes receivable $ 42 $ 76 Deferred development 2 Contract acquisition costs 33 34 Equity and cost method investments 316 377 Loans to equity method investees 21 27 Long term deferred tax asset, net 1 4 Current liabilities: Other payables and accruals (2 ) (2 ) Other long term liabilities (16 ) (13 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. 55 Table of Contents Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. Where we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $112 million. We had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $92 million. We had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2007 and 2006, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $102 million and $138 million, respectively. Loans to Timeshare Owners In accordance with the adoption of SOP 04 2 in 2006, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past three years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each years sales over the life of those notes. At year end 2007 and year end 2006, our allowance for credit losses associated with Loans to timeshare owners totaled $19 million and $29 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 57 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices, and with respect to our synthetic fuel business, changes in oil prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities and common stock, which have a carrying value of $55 million at year end 2007, which we account for as available for sale securities under FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year end 2007, we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010. Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we have been required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $157 million, and they expire through 2022. Option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates during 2008. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was approximately $86 million, and they expire throughout 2008. Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was approximately $58 million, and they expire in 2008 and 2010. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was $133 million at year end 2007. Oil price hedges to manage the volatility associated with oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits in 2007. The hedges cover 19 million barrels of oil and expired on December 31, 2007. 58 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year end 2007: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
