Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,178 properties (560,681 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year end 2008 and include 27 home and condominium projects (2,482 units) for which we manage the related owners associations. In addition, we provided 2,332 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 18 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand alone basis under The Ritz Carlton brand (Ritz Carlton Residential), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (Ritz Carlton Club Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. The economic recession, the global credit crisis and eroded consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2008. U.S. lodging demand declined throughout 2008, but especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of slowing economic growth. Outside the United States, international lodging demand was generally stronger in most markets than in the United States, but also softened progressively throughout 2008 and declined markedly in the 2008 fourth quarter. Leisure transient demand in the United States weakened in the first quarter of 2008 and was joined by weakening business transient demand beginning in the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, demand associated with our luxury properties decreased dramatically in the 2008 fourth quarter. These factors were compounded in several markets in the United States where the supply of hotel rooms increased. Last minute new group meeting demand and attendance at group meetings softened considerably throughout 2008 as well, and group meeting cancellations increased significantly in the fourth quarter. While some business customers increased room nights in 2008, including professional services firms, defense contractors, and insurance companies, others declined, including companies associated with the financial services, automotive, and telecommunications industries. In general, for the properties in our system, international, and full service properties experienced stronger demand worldwide than our limited service and luxury properties. U.S. demand for timeshare intervals also softened considerably in 2008, and especially in the fourth quarter, reflecting weak consumer confidence and a very difficult financing environment, while demand in Latin America and Asia for timeshare products was stronger compared to 2007. Demand for Ritz Carlton fractional and residential units was particularly weak. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage of completion accounting method, soft demand is frequently not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also unfavorably impact nearer term Timeshare segment results as percentage of completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well. Responding to the challenging demand environment in 2008 for hotel rooms, we initiated a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase property level revenue. These promotions were designed to keep current customers loyal while also attracting new guests. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we have also implemented sales associate and customer incentives to close on business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating with more than 300,000 of our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and through our blog Marriott on the Move. We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically market to this large and growing customer base. 24 Table of Contents Given this slower demand environment, we worked aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property level house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, and not filling some vacant positions. While varying by property, most properties in our system have instituted contingency plans with very tight cost controls. We have also reduced the above property costs by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas that are allocated to the hotels. We have also eliminated certain positions, not filled some vacant positions, and will encourage, and where legally permitted, require employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Additionally, we canceled certain hotel development projects. For our Timeshare segment, we have slowed or canceled some development projects, closed less efficient timeshare sales offices and increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives. For additional information on our companywide restructuring efforts, see our Restructuring Costs and Other Charges caption later in this section. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year end 2008, 48 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 50 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on property management and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make, we increase our financial flexibility. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR decreased in 2008, compared to the year ago period, with moderately greater strength in Manhattan, New York, Houston, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles, California and weaker RevPAR in suburban markets near, among other areas, Orange County, California, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. Outside North America, 2008 RevPAR increases versus the prior year period were stronger, particularly in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. Company operated house profit margin is the ratio of property level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Compared to 2007, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins for 2008 decreased by 70 basis points reflecting the impact of stronger year over year RevPAR associated with international properties and very strong cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system. This impact was more than offset by the impact of RevPAR declines year over year associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and higher expenses in 2008 in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. The Companys fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest December 31 and while the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years included 52 weeks, the 2008 fiscal year included 53 weeks. As the 53rd week for 2008 included the New Years holiday and was seasonally slow, it had the effect of reducing year over year RevPAR performance. While worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company operated properties decreased 1.1 percent compared to 2007, worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company operated properties excluding the extra 53rd week decreased 0.4 percent compared to 2007. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information rich and easy to use Web site, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary Web site, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property level reservations via this cost efficient channel. We have added other languages to Marriott.com and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions. 25 Table of Contents See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report for important information regarding forward looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2008, 2007, and 2006. Continuing Operations Revenues 2008 Compared to 2007 Revenues decreased by $111 million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system. Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2007; and (2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher property level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the BUSINESS SEGMENTS discussion later in this report for additional information. The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels. Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from $8,575 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system. 2007 Compared to 2006 Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized 26 Table of Contents $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property level margins higher. Year over year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007, compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in 2007 and $52 million in 2006), offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, compared to the recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006. The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million (6 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system. Restructuring Costs and Other Charges During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and, particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008. These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. We responded by implementing certain companywide cost saving measures, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost saving measures. Upper level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, hotel operations, development, and above property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also incurred other charges, including charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses, and inventory write downs on Timeshare inventory, reserves on accounts receivable, contract cancellation allowances, a charge related to the valuation of Timeshare residual interests, a charge associated with hedge ineffectiveness related to Timeshare note sale hedges, and asset impairments and other charges, detailed further in Other Charges. As part of the restructuring efforts in our Timeshare segment, we reduced and consolidated sales channels in the United States and closed down certain operations in Europe. We recorded Timeshare restructuring costs of $28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter, including: (1) $14 million in severance costs; (2) $5 million in facilities exit costs, primarily associated with noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel; and (3) $9 million related to the write off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We expect to complete this restructuring by year end 2009. We are projecting $55 million to $65 million ($35 million to $42 million after tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the Timeshare direct and the General, administrative, and other expenses captions in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment. We recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of $24 million, including: (1) $2 million in severance costs; and (2) $22 million related to the write off of 27 Table of Contents capitalized costs relating to development projects that we discontinued, including capitalized costs related to owned development of Renaissance ClubSport. We expect to complete this restructuring by year end 2009. We are projecting up to $6 million ($4 million after tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also implemented restructuring initiatives by reducing above property level lodging management personnel and corporate overhead. We incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $3 million primarily reflecting severance costs. We expect to complete this restructuring by year end 2009. We are projecting up to $4 million ($3 million after tax) of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring. These savings will likely be reflected in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We have provided detailed information related to these restructuring costs and other charges below. Restructuring Costs Severance These various restructuring initiatives resulted in an overall reduction of 1,021 employees (the majority of whom were terminated by January 2, 2009) across the Company. We recorded a total workforce reduction charge of $19 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits, which consisted of $14 million for the Timeshare segment, $2 million related to hotel development, and $3 million related to above property level lodging management and corporate overhead. The charge does not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property level severance costs. We also delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours. In connection with these initiatives, we expect to incur an additional $3 million to $4 million related to severance and fringe benefits in 2009 for the Timeshare segment. Facilities Exit Costs As a result of workforce reductions and delays in filling vacant positions that were part of the Timeshare segment restructuring, we ceased using certain leased facilities. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $5 million associated with these facilities, primarily related to noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income. In connection with these initiatives, in 2009, we expect to incur an additional $2 million to $3 million related to ceasing use of additional noncancelable leases. Development Cancellations We sometimes incur certain costs associated with the development of hotel and timeshare properties, including legal costs, the cost of land, and planning and design costs. We capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed. As a result of the sharp downturn in the economy, we decided to discontinue certain development projects that required our investment, including our Renaissance ClubSport real estate development activities. These cancellations do not impact the two Renaissance ClubSport properties that are currently open. As a result of these development cancellations, we expensed $31 million of previously capitalized costs, which consisted of $9 million of costs for the Timeshare segment and $22 million of costs related to hotel development. We do not currently expect to expense any additional capitalized costs in 2009 in connection with these restructuring initiatives. Other Charges Charges for Guarantees and Reserves for Loan Losses We sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with some financing transactions and other obligations. We also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage. As a result of the downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us or, in some cases, to third party lending institutions. In addition, we expect profit levels at a few hotels to drop below guaranteed levels. As a result, based on cash flow projections, we expect to fund under some of our guarantees, which we do not deem recoverable, and we expect that one of the loans made by us will not be repaid according to its original terms. Due to the expected fundings under guarantees that we deemed nonrecoverable, we recorded charges of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the expected loan loss, we recorded a charge of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the Provision for loan losses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 28 Table of Contents Timeshare Inventory Write downs As a result of terminating certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, we recorded an inventory write down of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We recorded this charge in the Timeshare direct caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounts Receivable Bad Debts In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reserved $4 million of accounts receivable, which we deemed uncollectible, generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment, following an analysis of those accounts. We recorded this charge in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Timeshare Contract Cancellation Allowances Our financial statements reflect net contract cancellation allowances totaling $12 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue and cost previously recorded for certain projects under the percentage of completion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. We have an equity method investment in one of these projects, and reflected $7 million of the $12 million in the Equity in earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining net $5 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a reduction in revenue, net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs, and was recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct costs. Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation The fair market value of our residual interest in timeshare notes sold declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests. The increase in the market rate of interest reflects deteriorating economic conditions and disruption in the credit markets, which significantly increased the borrowing costs to issuers. As a result of this change, we recorded a $32 million charge in the Timeshare sales and services caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income to reflect the decrease in the fair value of these residual interests. Timeshare Hedge Ineffectiveness Given the significant deterioration in the credit markets, we expect that any potential note sale transactions pursued by the Company in the near term will be materially different from arrangements originally contemplated, and accordingly the sensitivity of a hedge the Company previously entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted note sales no longer significantly corresponds to the sensitivity in expected note sale proceeds. Differences include expected legal structures, modifications to priority of cash flow, and higher costs. The change in terms (inputs) used to determine hedge effectiveness for Timeshares note sale hedges resulted in the recognition of $12 million in hedge ineffectiveness. We recorded this hedge ineffectiveness as a reduction in note sale gains in the Timeshare sales and services caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Asset Impairments and Other Charges One project that is in development and in which the Company has a joint venture investment was unable to draw on existing financing commitments as a result of the recent turmoil in the capital markets and the bankruptcy of the projects major lender. As a result, based on our analysis of expected future cash flows, we determined that our investment in that joint venture was fully impaired, and we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million in the Equity in earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and the inability of certain developers to obtain financing, we also recorded write offs of other assets ($12 million) related to development costs associated with projects we no longer deem probable in the General, administrative, and other expenses caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also deemed certain cost method tax investments to be other than temporarily impaired because we do not expect to receive any future economic benefit from these investments. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million for those investments in the Gains and other income caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. 29 Table of Contents Summary of Restructuring Costs and Other Charges The following table is a summary of the restructuring costs and other charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as our remaining liability at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 and remaining restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2009 as part of these restructuring initiatives: ($ in millions) TotalCharge Non CashCharge Cash Paymentsin the 2008Fourth Quarter Restructuring Costsand Other ChargesLiability atJanuary 2, 2009 RestructuringCosts Expectedto be Incurredin 2009 Severance Timeshare $ 14 $ $ 3 $ 11 $ 3 4 Facilities exit costs Timeshare 5 5 2 3 Development cancellations Timeshare 9 9 Total restructuring costs Timeshare 28 9 3 16 5 7 Severance hotel development 2 2 Development cancellations hotel development 22 22 Total restructuring costs hotel development 24 22 2 Severance above property level management 3 1 2 Total restructuring costs above property level management 3 1 2 Total restructuring costs $ 55 $ 31 $ 4 $ 20 $ 5 7 Reserves for guarantees and loan losses 38 22 16 Inventory write downs 9 9 Accounts receivable bad debts 4 4 Contract cancellation allowances 12 12 Residual interests valuation 32 32 Hedge ineffectiveness 12 12 Impairment of investments and other 30 30 Total other charges 137 121 16 Total restructuring and other charges $ 192 $ 152 $ 4 $ 36 We anticipate that the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid by the end of 2009 for the Timeshare segment, by the end of 2009 for hotel development, and by the end of 2009 for above property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year end 2010.

The decrease in operating income reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $41 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, and a $15 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of $27 million. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled $89 million. The decline of $261 million (75 percent) from the prior year primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential products, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a $22 million pretax impairment charge ($10 million net of minority interest benefit), start up costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds, as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. The decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008, compared to the prior year. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $41 million (23 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $21 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, $4 million of lower termination fees, and $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. Partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling $6 million in 2008 associated with one property, compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of $8 million associated with that same property that was reclassified from held for sale to held and used. General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $15 million (2 percent) to $783 million in 2008 from $768 million in 2007. This increase reflected the following items: $44 million of increased expenses associated with, among other things, our unit growth and development, systems improvements, and initiatives to enhance our brands globally; a $16 million charge for certain guarantees; an unfavorable $9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007; $12 million in write offs in 2008 of costs related to development cancellations; $4 million of increased foreign exchange losses; and $4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable. See Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees, development cancellation write offs, and bad debt reserves. These unfavorable 31 Table of Contents variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of $35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor of our employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) feature of our Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the Plan). See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, 2008 included a $28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to an $11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year, both of which reflected mark to market valuations. Of the $15 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $51 million was attributable to our Lodging and Timeshare segments and a decrease of $36 million, reflecting the 2007 ESOP settlement charge, was unallocated. The reasons for the decrease of $58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of $27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding Revenues section. 2007 Compared to 2006 Operating income increased by $101 million (9 percent) to $1,188 million in 2007 from $1,087 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees of $204 million, partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses of $91 million, lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $7 million, and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $5 million. The combined base management, incentive management, and franchise fees increase of $204 million reflected strong RevPAR growth, unit growth, and property level margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Compared to the year ago period, general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $91 million (13 percent) to $768 million in 2007 from $677 million in 2006. In 2007, we incurred a $35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the IRS and Department of Labor examination of our ESOP feature of our Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the Plan). See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, the increase was attributable to, among other things, increased costs related to our unit growth, development and systems improvements, increased legal expenses, and increased other administrative costs. Also unfavorably impacting general, administrative, and other expenses, when compared to the prior year, were foreign exchange losses totaling $2 million in 2007 compared to foreign exchange gains of $6 million in 2006 and $1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the year ago period reflected $6 million of guarantee reversals. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were $4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 compared to 2006 and a $9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required. Increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters. Of the $91 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Lodging and Timeshare segments and a $78 million increase was unallocated. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million (2 percent), compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of $15 million of contingency reserves and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, compared to 2006. The $5 million (3 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected $19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, compared to $26 million in 2006. Depreciation charges totaling $8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned property that was reclassified from held for sale to held and used during 2007 compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of $7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held and used. Partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net 32 Table of Contents of direct expenses was the favorable impact of $4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties. Gains and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gain on debt extinguishment $ 28 $ $ Gains on sales of real estate and other 14 39 26 Loss on expected land sale (37 ) Other note sale/repayment gains 1 2 Gains on forgiveness of debt 12 (Loss)/gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments (1 ) 31 68 (Loss)/income from cost method joint ventures (3 ) 14 15 $ 38 $ 97 $ 74 2008 Compared to 2007 The $28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our Senior Notes we repurchased. For additional information on the debt extinguishment, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section later in this report. The $25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our International segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008. The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the 2007 Compared to 2006 section below. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Income from cost method joint ventures decreased $17 million to a loss of $3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (see the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information). 2007 Compared to 2006 The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives. The loans were forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Gain on sale/income on redemption of joint venture and other investments of $68 million in 2006 was comprised of $43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee, which generated a gain of $25 million. Gains on sales of real estate and other increased $13 million in 2007, and primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate by our International segment in 2007 that did not occur in 2006, partially offset by smaller gains in 2006 that did not occur in 2007. Interest Expense 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest expense decreased by $21 million (11 percent) to $163 million in 2008 compared to $184 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year reflected a charge of $13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the ESOP settlement in 2007. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding, lower interest rates on commercial paper, and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. As a result, year over year interest expense was lower by $7 million. We also benefitted from a $15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects, and the maturity of our Series E Senior Notes in early 2008 yielding a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year. The write off of $2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008. These favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by $30 million. 33 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest expense increased by $60 million (48 percent) to $184 million for 2007 from $124 million in 2006. Of the $60 million increase over 2006, $78 million was due to: $26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance, primarily due to increased share repurchases and the ESOP settlement payments, and related interest rates; $25 million of interest associated with our Series H Senior Notes issuance, which occurred late in 2006 and our Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in 2007; a charge of $13 million in 2007 related to the ESOP settlement; charges totaling $53 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners behalf (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self insurance programs); interest totaling $5 million associated with other additional debt; and the write off of $2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007. See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. The increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the year ago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting the $78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an $18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects. Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased by $1 million (3 percent) to $39 million from $38 million in the prior year. The provision for loan losses increased by $3 million (18 percent) to $20 million from $17 million in the prior year. The increase reflected provisions recorded in 2008 including a $22 million provision on a fully impaired loan (see the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information) and a $3 million loan loss provision associated with one property. The unfavorable variance associated with the 2008 provisions was mostly offset by favorable variances associated with a $12 million provision recorded in 2007, related to one property, a $5 million provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease, and the reversal of $5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment write off, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption later in this report. Our tax provision decreased by $91 million (21 percent) to $350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008, a 2007 charge for a German legislative tax change, and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. This decrease was partially offset by $39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008. The higher 2008 tax rate reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries that is in ongoing discussions with the IRS. 2007 Compared to 2006 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, decreased by $11 million (22 percent) to $38 million in 2007 from $49 million in 2006, primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us, partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings. Loan loss provisions increased by $20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a $12 million charge associated with one property and a $5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease versus loan loss reversals of $3 million in 2006. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment write off, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption later in this report. Our tax provision increased by $61 million (16 percent) to $441 million in 2007 from a tax provision of $380 million in 2006 and reflected higher pretax income from our Lodging and Timeshare segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007, primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries. Increased taxes also reflect a charge for a German legislative tax change in 2007, which had a one time impact and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, for additional information on the ESOP settlement. 34 Table of Contents Equity in Earnings (Losses) 2008 Compared to 2007 Equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 was unchanged from earnings of $15 million in 2007 and primarily reflected $14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture, which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains, $10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to start up costs in the prior year, and $5 million of increased earnings from an international segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008, partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate, an impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development, and a $7 million impact related to contract cancellation allowances recorded at one Timeshare segment joint venture (see the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information on the impairment and contract cancellation allowances). 2007 Compared to 2006 Equity in earnings increased by $12 million to earnings of $15 million from $3 million in 2006 and reflected the mix of investments, compared to 2006, and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007, for one joint venture, the reopening of a hotel, late in 2006, in Mexico, which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in Hawaii. Minority Interest 2008 Compared to 2007 Minority interest increased by $14 million in 2008 to a $15 million benefit. The minority interest benefit of $15 million is net of tax and reflected our partners share of losses totaling $24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners share of tax benefits of $9 million associated with the losses. Income from Continuing Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Compared to the prior year, income from continuing operations decreased by $338 million (48 percent) to $359 million in 2008, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by $0.77 (44 percent) to $0.98. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the decrease versus the prior year was due to lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($261 million), lower gains and other income ($59 million), lower incentive management fees ($58 million), restructuring costs recorded in 2008 ($55 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($41 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($15 million), and higher provision for loan losses ($3 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were lower income taxes ($91 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($27 million), lower interest expense ($21 million), a higher minority interest benefit ($14 million), and higher interest income ($1 million). 2007 Compared to 2006 Compared to 2006, income from continuing operations decreased by $15 million (2 percent) to $697 million in 2007, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by $0.10 (6 percent) to $1.75. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($91 million), higher taxes ($61 million), higher interest expense ($60 million), higher loan loss provision ($20 million), lower interest income ($11 million), lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($7 million), and lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($5 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were higher fee income ($204 million), higher gains and other income ($23 million), higher equity investment results ($12 million), and a higher minority interest benefit ($1 million). Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 2006 Statement of Position 04 2, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04 2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and FAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and 35 Table of Contents Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to exclude accounting for real estate time sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04 2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04 2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which require us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The adoption of SOP 04 2 in 2006, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statements of Income, resulted in a non cash after tax charge of $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). The pretax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that, for the 20 year period from 2009 through 2028, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $3.5 billion. Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada; North American Limited Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada; International Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & Resorts, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada; Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts properties worldwide (together with adjacent residential projects associated with some Ritz Carlton hotels), as well as Edition, for which no properties are yet open; and Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club and Residences, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide. In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, income taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We also include interest income associated with our Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segments business. Additionally, we allocate other gains and losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and minority interests in income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries to each of our segments. Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full Service, North American Limited Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure. 36 Table of Contents Total Lodging and Timeshare Products by Segment At year end 2008, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,332 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non U.S. Total U.S. Non U.S. Total North American Full Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 317 12 329 124,425 4,558 128,983 Marriott Conference Centers 11 11 3,133 3,133 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 15 1 16 7,901 221 8,122 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts 74 3 77 27,425 1,034 28,459 Renaissance ClubSport 2 2 349 349 419 16 435 163,233 5,813 169,046 North American Limited Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 728 16 744 101,743 2,847 104,590 Fairfield Inn 560 8 568 49,678 903 50,581 SpringHill Suites 207 1 208 24,027 124 24,151 Residence Inn 555 17 572 66,252 2,590 68,842 TownePlace Suites 163 163 16,328 16,328 2,213 42 2,255 258,028 6,464 264,492 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 145 149 2,767 40,851 43,618 JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts 1 25 26 387 8,987 9,374 Renaissance Hotels & Resorts 62 62 20,581 20,581 Courtyard 64 64 12,668 12,668 Fairfield Inn 1 1 206 206 Residence Inn 1 1 75 75 Marriott Executive Apartments 20 20 3,217 3,217 5 318 323 3,154 86,585 89,739 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz Carlton 37 33 70 11,629 10,204 21,833 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts 2 2 117 117 The Ritz Carlton Residential (2) 22 1 23 2,176 93 2,269 The Ritz Carlton Serviced Apartments 3 3 478 478 59 39 98 13,805 10,892 24,697 Timeshare Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 39 10 49 9,282 2,071 11,353 The Ritz Carlton Club Fractional 7 3 10 339 117 456 The Ritz Carlton Club Residential (2) 2 1 3 138 10 148 Grand Residences by Marriott Fractional 1 1 2 199 42 241 Grand Residences by Marriott Residential (1), (2) 1 1 65 65 Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club 2 2 444 444 52 15 67 10,467 2,240 12,707 Total 2,748 430 3,178 448,687 111,994 560,681 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

Accordingly, as of year end 2008, we allocated net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as shown in the following table: Minority Interest ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 North American Full Service Segment $ $ $ 1 International Segment (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Luxury Segment 1 Timeshare Segment 25 1 Total segment minority interest 24 1 Provision for income taxes (9 ) $ 15 $ 1 $ Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 North American Full Service Segment $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 North American Limited Service Segment 2 International Segment (2 ) 3 Luxury Segment (12 ) (4 ) (2 ) Timeshare Segment 11 10 (2 ) Total segment equity in earnings (losses) 14 (2 ) Other unallocated corporate 15 1 5 $ 15 $ 15 $ 3 38 Table of Contents Our business includes our North American Full Service, North American Limited Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments. We consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies. 2008 Compared to 2007 We added 215 properties (32,842 rooms) and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) exited the system in 2008, not including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units) in 2008. Total segment financial results decreased by $422 million (27 percent) to $1,166 million in 2008 from $1,588 million in the prior year, and total segment revenues decreased by $92 million to $12,817 million in 2008, a 1 percent decrease from revenues of $12,909 million in 2007. While demand was weaker in 2008 compared to 2007, international and full service properties experienced stronger demand than luxury and limited service properties. The decrease in revenues included a $259 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. The results, compared to the year ago period, reflected a decrease of $261 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $51 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $37 million in gains and other income, $29 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, a decrease of $22 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $14 million of lower equity joint venture results. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $27 million (3 percent) increase in combined base management and franchise fees to $1,086 million in the 2008 period from $1,059 million in 2007 and a $23 million increase in minority interest benefit. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from rate increases in international markets, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Compared to 2007, incentive management fees decreased by $58 million (16 percent) in 2008 and reflected the recognition in 2007 of $17 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2007. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property level profitability due to lower RevPAR, higher property level wages and benefits costs, and utilities costs, particularly in North America. In 2008, 56 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 67 percent in 2007. In addition, in 2008, 49 percent of our incentive fees were derived from international hotels versus 35 percent in 2007. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties decreased by 2.7 percent and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties decreased by 2.9 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 3.6 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased by 3.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties decreased by 1.5 percent (0.8 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties decreased by 1.1 percent (0.2 percent using actual dollars). Compared to the year ago period, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2008 decreased by 70 basis points, reflecting the impact of stronger year over year RevPAR associated with international properties and very tight cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year over year RevPAR decreases associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and also higher expenses in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. North American company operated house profit margins declined by 140 basis points reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand and higher operating costs, including those associated with wages and benefits and utilities. For 2008, house profit per available room (HP PAR) at our North American managed properties decreased by 5.8 percent. HP PAR at our North American limited service managed properties decreased by 8.0 percent, and worldwide HP PAR for all our brands increased by 2.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis. 2007 Compared to 2006 We added 203 properties (29,200 rooms) and 55 properties (9,722 rooms) exited the system in 2007, not including residential products. We also added three residential properties (347 units) in 2007. 39 Table of Contents Total segment financial results increased by $173 million (12 percent) to $1,588 million in 2007 from $1,415 million in 2006, and total segment revenues increased by $979 million to $12,909 million in 2007, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $11,930 million in 2006. The results, compared to the prior year, reflect a $204 million (17 percent) increase in combined base management, franchise, and incentive management fees to $1,428 million in 2007 from $1,224 million in 2006, a $16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments, and a $1 million minority interest benefit. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease of $18 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $10 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $7 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from both domestic and international rate increases, higher property level food and beverage and other revenue, and new unit growth, drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million (31 percent) during 2007, reflecting the impact of strong room rate increases and property level margin improvements associated with productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods earnings, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years and base management fees included $6 million and $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years, received in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, 67 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 62 percent in 2006. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable North American properties increased by 6.0 percent over 2006, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties increased by 6.2 percent over 2006. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 8.4 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased by 8.9 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties increased by 6.5 percent (7.6 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties increased by 7.0 percent (8.8 percent using actual dollars). Compared to 2006, 2007 worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins increased by 150 basis points, while North American company operated house profit margins improved by 160 basis points versus 2006. For 2007, compared to 2006, HP PAR at our full service managed properties in North America increased by 10.6 percent. HP PAR at our North American limited service managed properties increased by 8.9 percent, and worldwide HP PAR for all our brands increased by 11.0 percent on a constant dollar basis. Lodging Development We opened 215 properties, totaling 32,842 rooms, across our brands in 2008 and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units). Highlights of the year included: Converting 31 properties (6,439 rooms), or 19 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 12 percent of those rooms were located in international markets; Opening approximately 24 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; Adding 168 properties (19,747 rooms) to our North American Limited Service brands; and Opening one new Marriott Vacation Club property in Asia on the island of Phuket, Thailand. We currently have more than 125,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add over 30,000 hotel rooms to our system in 2009. Recent events, including failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies, have made the capital markets increasingly volatile. Accordingly, given the difficult lending environment, the Company, owners or franchisees may decide to reevaluate continuing some of the projects included in the development pipeline. While the company has invested in few of its pipeline projects, possible delays, cancellations, or financial restructurings of projects under development could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to sell properties 40 Table of Contents that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report. Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full Service and North American Limited Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company operated Fairfield Inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised, and such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through January 2, 2009, the statistics for 2007 include the 52 weeks from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007, and the statistics for 2006 include the period from December 31, 2005, through December 29, 2006 (except in each case, for The Ritz Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 41 Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2008 Change vs. 2007 2008 Change vs. 2007 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 70.5 % 2.1 % pts. 68.0 % 2.5 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Segment revenues $ 5,631 $ 5,476 $ 5,196 3 % 5 % Segment results $ 419 $ 478 $ 455 12 % 5 % 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,611 rooms) and three properties (493 rooms) left the system. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties decreased by 1.6 percent to $123.98, occupancy decreased by 2.0 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 1.2 percent to $176.30. The $59 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, primarily reflected a $35 million decrease in incentive management fees and a $25 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $2 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was in part due to the recognition, in 2007, of business interruption insurance proceeds totaling $12 million associated with Hurricane Katrina and also reflected lower demand and property level margins in 2008 compared to 2007. The slight increase of $2 million in base management and franchise fees was a product of unit growth and an additional week of sales, mostly offset by lower RevPAR. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable $7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008, $8 million of losses associated with three properties, one of which was a new property that opened in 2008, $5 million of lower contract termination fees received, $2 million of lower land rent income, and an unfavorable $3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service segment properties totaled $4,951 million in 2008, compared to $4,782 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 13 properties (3,947 rooms) and six properties (2,853 rooms) left the system. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties increased by 6.8 percent to $126.92, occupancy increased by 0.9 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $174.54. The $23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a $65 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, partially offset by a $22 million decline in gains and other income and a $20 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. The $65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger RevPAR and property level margins, driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of $2 million, both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina, and no similar fees in 2006. Additionally, 2006 reflected the recognition of $3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007. Gains and other income was $22 million lower in 2007, compared to 2006, and reflected a $37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straight line rent receivable, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of $25 million in 2006 and $34 million of lower other gains in 2007, compared to 2006. The $34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate, while 2007 reflects limited similar activity. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by $20 million and reflected properties sold and 48 Table of Contents $10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006, compared to $3 million of such fees received in 2007. General, administrative, and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged compared to 2006 primarily reflecting $5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the write off of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service segment properties totaled $4,782 million in 2007, compared to $4,527 million in 2006.

The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties decreased by 4.2 percent to $85.83, occupancy decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 69.4 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 0.5 percent to $123.69. The $66 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected $43 million of lower incentive management fees, $14 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $13 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower gains and other income, partially offset by a $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees was largely due to unit growth, partially offset by a decrease in relicensing fees. The $43 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins and the recognition, in 2007, of $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2007. The $14 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected a $15 million charge related to a shortfall funding under a guarantee (see the Other Charges caption in Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information). The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $6 million of franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn brand properties that left our system, and $7 million of lower income due to lower revenue and property level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service segment properties totaled $1,541 million in 2008, compared to $1,470 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 156 properties (17,517 rooms) and 16 properties (1,853 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn brand. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties increased by 4.8 percent to $89.18, occupancy for these properties decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 72.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 5.4 percent to $122.63. The $81 million increase in segment results, compared to 2006, primarily reflected an $83 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, a $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $2 million increase in gains and other income, and a $2 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $11 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. 49 Table of Contents In 2007, we recognized $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years results but not earned and due until 2007 compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006. The additional increase in fees is largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases, which increased base management and franchise fees, and to productivity improvements, which increased property level margins and incentive management fees. Additionally, growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $5 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of $6 million received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn brand properties that left our system and $1 million of similar fees in 2006. The $11 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the write off of $3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service segment properties totaled $1,470 million in 2007, compared to $1,423 million in 2006.

In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased by 2.6 percent to $131.00, occupancy for these properties decreased by 2.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.0 percent to $180.81. Results for our international operations were favorable across most regions, but weakened progressively throughout 2008 and especially in the fourth quarter. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were strongest in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. The $25 million decrease in segment results in 2008, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected a $32 million decrease in gains and other income, a $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and a decrease of $5 million in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by an $18 million increase in incentive management fees and an $11 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained unchanged in 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in fees was largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, reflected unit growth and cost control plans, which increased property level margins and incentive management fees. The $32 million decrease in gains and other income in 2008, compared to 2007, reflected the recognition of gains totaling $9 million in 2008, compared to gains in 2007 of $41 million. The 2007 gains primarily reflected a $10 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture and a gain totaling $23 million associated with sales of real estate. The $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher wage and benefit costs and costs associated with unit growth and development. Joint venture equity results were lower than the prior year by $5 million primarily reflecting an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct of expenses remained unchanged and reflected $17 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, which was completely offset by $11 million of stronger results at some properties, $5 million of higher termination fees, and $1 million of higher branding fees. 50 Table of Contents Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $707 million in 2008, compared to $741 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our International Lodging segment, we added 20 properties (4,686 rooms) and 31 properties (4,678 rooms) left the system in 2007, primarily due to quality issues. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased by 8.2 percent to $127.44, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.8 percentage points to 75.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 7.0 percent to $168.30. Results for our international operations were strong across most regions. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and Southeast Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The $34 million increase in segment results in 2007 compared to 2006, reflected a $27 million increase in base management, incentive management, and franchise fees, an $11 million increase in gains and other income, and a $3 million increase in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by $7 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Incentive management fees included $2 million for 2007 that were calculated based on prior periods earnings, but not earned and due until recognized, compared to $10 million of similar fees in 2006. The increase in fees is largely due to strong demand and higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. The $11 million increase in gains and other income reflected higher gains in 2007 on real estate sales, compared to the year ago period, offset by lower gains on the sale of joint ventures. The $7 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses from 2006 is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained flat primarily reflecting hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees of $8 million received in 2007 and $12 million of similar fees in 2006, entirely offset by the improved performance of our owned and leased properties in 2007. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $741 million in 2007, compared to $635 million in 2006.

In addition, we added seven residential products (654 units) in 2008. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties decreased by 0.1 percent to $225.87, occupancy for these properties decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 69.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.7 percent to $326.63. The $6 million increase in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected a $7 million increase in base management and incentive management fees and $18 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $8 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, an $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, $1 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, (see Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for additional information), and a $1 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees over the year ago period reflected new properties added to the system, partially offset by the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years. The $18 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges of $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to held and used, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale, compared to $6 million of depreciation charges for that same property in 2008, as well as expenses totaling $3 million in 2007 associated with opening a new leased property, $10 million of improved results in 2008 associated with two properties, one of which was being renovated in 2007, and $2 million of increased branding fees in 2008. 51 Table of Contents The $8 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected costs associated with unit growth and development as well as bad debt expense related to accounts receivable deemed uncollectible (see the Other Charges caption in Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information). The $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the Other Charges caption in Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information). Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2008, compared to $1,307 million in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 In 2007, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (2,529 rooms) and one property (273 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added three residential products (347 units) in 2007. In 2007, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased by 9.4 percent to $227.87, occupancy for these properties increased by 1.8 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.6 percent to $314.36. The $9 million increase in segment results, compared to 2006, reflected a $20 million increase in base management and incentive management fees, partially offset by $6 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, $3 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower equity joint venture results. Fiscal year 2006 included $2 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2006, compared to no similar fees in 2007. The increase in fees over the prior year reflects stronger RevPAR driven by rate increases, new properties added to the system, the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years, the year over year favorable impact associated with the reopening, late in 2006, of two properties impacted by the same aforementioned hurricanes and increased branding fees. The $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses is primarily attributable to costs related to our unit growth and development. The $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges totaling $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to held and used, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale, partially offset by a favorable $3 million impact associated with the opening of a new leased property in 2007.

Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $325 million (23 percent) compared to 2007 to $1,076 million from $1,401 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2008, compared to the prior year, reflected a $173 million decrease in timeshare sales, an $83 million decrease in residential sales, and a $69 million decrease in fractional sales. The decrease in timeshare contract sales reflected the impact of projects approaching sellout and significantly lower demand. Sales of residential and fractional units were significantly impacted by weak demand, as well as increased cancellation allowances of $115 million recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded under the percentage of completion method for certain projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for additional information). The $315 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,750 million from $2,065 million reflected a $324 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, and a $1 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $10 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008, a $32 million impact from the reduced valuation of residual interests, contract cancellation allowances of $17 million, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, as well as the recognition, in 2007, of revenues received in prior years for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, revenue that became reportable subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year, and increased services revenue. Timeshare segment revenues for 2008 and 2007 included 53 Table of Contents $68 million and $50 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $16 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Segment results of $28 million in 2008 decreased by $278 million from $306 million in 2007, and reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $28 million of restructuring costs, and $13 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $24 million higher minority interest benefit and $1 million in higher joint venture equity earnings. The $261 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, increased marketing and sales costs, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, start up costs in 2008 for newer projects, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, revenue recognition for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, a $9 million impact from inventory write downs related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, and a $5 million net impact from contract cancellation allowances (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for additional information). In addition, development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected an impairment charge. We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million ($10 million net of minority interest benefit) in the 2008 third quarter within the Timeshare direct caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We made the adjustment in accordance with FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at year end 2008. The predominant items we considered in our analysis were the downturn in market conditions including contract cancellations, and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash flow model that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10 year risk free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments (3.68 percent). The $25 million benefit associated with minority interest reflected our joint venture partners portion of the losses of subsidiaries that we consolidate. The $25 million benefit also reflected the impact of the pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008, representing our joint venture partners pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge. The $95 million decrease in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected $65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007, mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007, $42 million of lower residual interest accretion, and $6 million of increased financing costs, partially offset by $18 million of increased interest income. Lower note sale gains of $65 million reflected a $12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the $42 million of lower residual interest accretion reflected a $32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair market value (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information regarding these charges). In 2008 and 2007, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $300 million and $520 million, respectively. The $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year. The $28 million of restructuring costs represented $14 million in severance costs, $9 million in development cancellations, and $5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment (see Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred). The $13 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits. Joint venture equity earnings increased $1 million and reflected $10 million of start up losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures, mostly offset by $7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for additional information) and $3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $285 million in 2008, compared to $275 million in 2007. 54 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by 14 percent compared to 2006, reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales, partially offset by increased timeshare sales. Contract sales in 2006 reflected particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our San Francisco and Kapalua, Hawaii products. The $225 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $2,065 million from $1,840 million reflected a $170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue, a $46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and $9 million of increased base management fees. The increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue. Higher base management fees reflect the growing number of timeshare resorts under management. Timeshare segment revenues include $50 million and $41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006, respectively, and note sale gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income on the Timeshare sales and services revenue line, associated with Timeshare segment notes receivable. Segment results of $306 million in 2007 increased by $26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected $9 million of increased base management fees, $12 million of increased joint venture equity results, and $11 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of $350 million decreased by $7 million, compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses, partially offset by the $15 million reversal of contingency reserves in 2006 and $4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses. Flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007, offset by several other projects that were approaching sell out. The increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected increased accretion, interest income, and higher note sale gains in 2007, compared to 2006. Compared to the prior year, the $12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflected strong demand in 2007 for our products in Kapalua, Hawaii and start up costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $275 million in 2007, compared to $229 million in 2006. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Airlines, which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $17 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007, and have no remaining exposure. Effective Tax Rate Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. As we exited the business in November 2007 our effective tax rate increased significantly, thereby reducing our after tax profits. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The tax credits provided under Internal Revenue Code Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, Discontinued Operations Synthetic Fuel, in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. 2008 Compared to 2007 The synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $1 million in 2008 and $352 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment totaled $3 million, net of tax, in 2008, compared to a loss of $1 million in 2007. Income 55 Table of Contents from the Synthetic Fuel segment of $3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the Secretary of the Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits. 2007 Compared to 2006 For 2007, the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $352 million versus revenue of $165 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting higher production in 2007. Production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment declined to a loss of $1 million in 2007 from income of $5 million in 2006, primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007, partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and, on the increased operating losses, a higher tax benefit. Results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 70.7 percent phase out of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phase out that was estimated at year end 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006. Additionally, results in 2007 reflect interest costs of $8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices. SHARE BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (Stock Option Program); (2) stock appreciation rights (SARs); (3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. During 2008 we granted 5.6 million restricted stock units (2.6 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted average grant date fair value of $35 per unit and 3.0 million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant date fair value of $26 per unit), 2.7 million Employee SARs (1.8 million, most of which were granted in February and had a weighted average grant date fair value of $13 per right and 0.9 million were granted in August and had a weighted average grant date fair value of $10 per right), and 4,000 Non employee SARs. During that time period, we also granted approximately 218,000 stock options and issued 25,000 deferred stock units. The grants made in August would ordinarily have been made in February 2009, but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate. Awards for the most senior executives were not accelerated. See Footnote No. 4, Share Based Compensation, later in this report for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EITF Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums We adopted the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums (EITF 06 8) on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 06 8 states that in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph 37(d) of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate (FAS No. 66), an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyers initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible. If an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph 37, including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs 8 through 12 of FAS No. 66, then the entity should apply the deposit method of accounting as described in paragraphs 65 through 67 of FAS No. 66. Although our adoption of EITF 06 8 had no impact on our wholly owned projects in conjunction with the adoption of EITF 06 8 by one joint venture in which we are a partner, we recorded the cumulative effect of applying EITF 06 8 as a reduction of $5 million to our investment in that joint venture, an increase in deferred tax assets of $2 million, and a reduction of $3 million to the opening balance of our retained earnings. The application of the continuing investment criterion in EITF 06 8 on the collectibility of the sales price could in certain future circumstances delay our ability, or the ability of joint ventures in which we are a partner, to recognize revenues and costs using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements We adopted FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157), on December 29, 2007, the first day of fiscal year 2008. FAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which amends FAS No. 157 by delaying its effective date by one year for non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Therefore, beginning on December 29, 2007, 56 Table of Contents this standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and non financial liabilities. On January 3, 2009, the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year, the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements. See Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information. Our servicing assets and residual interests, which are measured using Level 3 inputs (which are described in Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements) in the FAS No. 157 hierarchy, accounted for 94 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year end 2008, that are required to be measured at fair value using the guidance found in FAS No. 157. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of our residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. The implementation of FAS No. 157 did not result in material changes to the models or processes used to value these assets. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. The discount rates we use in determining the fair values of the residual interests are based on the general level of interest rates in the market and the assumed credit risk of the interests retained. We adjust these discount rates quarterly as interest rates and credit spreads in the market vary. During 2008, we used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, at the date of sale: average discount rate of 9.23 percent; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76 months; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. Our key assumptions are based on experience with notes receivable and servicing assets. The most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and the loan repayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on managements expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future interest rates, and other considerations. Actual repayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected, the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. If actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occur at a faster pace than we have projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. If actual default rates or actual discount rates are higher than we expect, the carrying value of retained interests could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the retained interests, including servicing assets, actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded. We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, as of the end of 2008 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. This methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. Before we applied any of these stress test changes, we determined that the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, was $221 million as of year end 2008. 57 Table of Contents Applying the stress tests, we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table below would have the following impact on the valuation of our residual interests at the end of 2008: Decrease in Year End Valuation($ in millions) PercentageDecrease 100 basis point increase in the prepayment rate $ 3 1.3% 200 basis point increase in the prepayment rate 6 2.6% 100 basis point increase in the discount rate 4 2.0% 200 basis point increase in the discount rate 9 3.9% Two month decline in the weighted average remaining term 2 0.8% Four month decline in the weighted average remaining term 4 1.7% We value our derivatives using valuations that are calibrated to the initial trade prices. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable, which are recorded within the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 We adopted FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS No. 159), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. This standard permits but does not require entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities in 2008. EITF Issue No. 07 6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy Sell Clause We adopted EITF Issue No. 07 6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the Requirements of FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy Sell Clause (EITF 07 6), on December 29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. EITF 07 6 clarifies whether a buy sell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No. 66. EITF 07 6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit sharing, leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy sell clause performed in fiscal years 2008 and thereafter. The adoption of EITF 07 6 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FASB Staff Position FAS No. 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities We adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year end. FSP FAS No. 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 amends FAS No. 140 to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors continuing involvements with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public enterprises, including sponsors that have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities. The FSP also requires disclosures by a public enterprise that is a sponsor of a qualifying special purpose entity (SPE) that holds a variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE and a servicer of a qualifying SPE that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying SPE. FSP FAS No. 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 is effective for year end 2008 disclosures. The adoption of FSP FAS No. 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FSP EITF 99 20 1 Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets We adopted FSP EITF 99 20 1 Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets, (FSP EITF 99 20 1) in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal year end. FSP EITF 99 20 1 amends EITF Issue No. 99 20 to align the impairment guidance in EITF Issue 58 Table of Contents No. 99 20 with that of FAS No. 115. FAS No. 115 measures impairment based on a determination of whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred. Our residual interests in our asset securitizations are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Therefore, the adoption of FSP EITF 99 20 1 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS No. 141(R)). FAS No. 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No. 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. Transaction costs will no longer be included in the measurement of the business acquired. Instead, these costs will be expensed as they are incurred. FAS No. 141(R) also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS No. 160). FAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. FAS No. 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS No. 161). FAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosure related to derivatives and hedging activities and thereby seeks to improve the transparency of financial reporting. Under FAS No. 161, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS No. 133), and its related interpretations; and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS No. 161 must be applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and non derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under FAS No. 133 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No. 161 will have on our financial statements. 59 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties. Events over the past several months, including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial services companies have made the capital markets increasingly volatile. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility) that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and has supported our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility provides for $2.5 billion of aggregate borrowings at any one time, and expires on May 14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information regarding our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to our Current Report on Form 8 K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits the Companys maximum leverage (defined in the credit agreement as Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including being well within the limits under the Credit Facility leverage covenant, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to increase our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels should we need to do so in the future. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. (LCPI), a subsidiary of Lehmann Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy on October 5, 2008, is one of the lenders under the Credit Facility, with a total aggregate funding commitment of $96 million (3.8 percent) of the $2.5 billion in total commitments. LCPI did not fund its share of our fourth quarter 2008 draws under the Credit Facility, and we have no reason to expect that it will do so in the future. Accordingly, the total current effective size of the Credit Facility is approximately $2.4 billion. The loss of $96 million in effective capacity is not material to us, and the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. At year end 2008, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.443 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.404 billion under our Credit Facility, and our cash balance of $134 million, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $126 million, and less Credit Facility borrowings outstanding of $969 million. We anticipate that this available capacity is adequate to fund our liquidity needs as noted above. In addition, as noted previously, we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facilitys covenants, and accordingly expect undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility to remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate considerably more than we anticipate. Until early in the 2008 fourth quarter, we regularly issued short term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. Our commercial paper issuances are subject to the then current demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets, as we do not have purchase commitments from buyers. Disruptions in the financial markets in September 2008 significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market. Accordingly, in September 2008 we borrowed under the Credit Facility to fund anticipated short term commercial paper maturities and, to a lesser extent, other general corporate needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, and suspended issuing commercial paper. All of our previously issued commercial paper has matured and been repaid. We anticipate issuing commercial paper when that market stabilizes and issuances can be made on favorable terms. We classify commercial paper as long term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. Fluctuations in the commercial paper market have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect them to do so in the future, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. 60 Table of Contents In November 2008 Standard & Poors changed the outlook on our BBB credit rating to negative, which resulted in an automatic downgrade in our commercial paper rating from A2 to A3. The market for A3 commercial paper is currently very limited. This limited availability, together with the higher interest costs associated with A3 issuances, currently makes it difficult and expensive for us to access the commercial paper market. Any future downgrades of our debt ratings by Standard & Poors, Moodys Investor Service, or other similar rating agencies could increase our cost of capital. We cannot assure you that downgrades will not occur in the future. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash from operations $ 641 $ 778 $ 970 Depreciation expense 155 162 155 Amortization expense 35 35 33 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.3 to 1.0 at year end 2008 and 1.2 to 1.0 at year end 2007. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, aggressive collection efforts, and high inventory turnover. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to this report, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 3.1x 4.3x 5.3x 4.6x 4.9x In response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products, we have correspondingly reduced our projected capital expenditures for 2009. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). As discussed in the second and third paragraphs following the table, the turmoil in the credit markets hurt the asset securitization market in 2008. Accordingly, we completed only one note sale transaction in 2008, compared with two such transactions in each of 2006 and 2007, and accordingly, note sale proceeds and note sale gains were both significantly lower in 2008 than in the prior two years. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Timeshare segment development in excess of cost of sales $ (299 ) $ (55 ) $ (83 ) New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (525 ) (559 ) (537 ) Note repurchases (56 ) (30 ) (55 ) Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 126 (16 ) 61 Note sale gains (16 ) (81 ) (77 ) Note sale proceeds 237 515 508 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 102 106 96 Other cash inflows (outflows) 33 (35 ) (17 ) Net cash outflows from Timeshare segment activity $ (398 ) $ (155 ) $ (104 ) In June 2008, prior to the end of our second quarter, we sold to a newly formed trust $300 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. On the same day, the trust issued $246 million of the trusts notes. In connection with the sale of notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million. We retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of $93 million. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, at the date of sale: average discount rate of 9.23 percent; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 24.01 percent; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 76 months; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 35 months. Our key assumptions are based on our experience 61 Table of Contents with Timeshare segment notes receivable that we originate. We recorded note sale gains totaling $16 million in 2008, which was net of a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness. Less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets have reduced our gain from Timeshare segment note sales during the past year, as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes have had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and, in the second quarter 2008 transaction, we retained a larger residual interest in the trust. For example, in the 2008 second quarter note sale, the trust that purchased our mortgage notes issued AAA rated asset backed notes at a spread of 325 basis points over the 3.935 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR, compared to AAA note spreads of 100 basis points over the 4.782 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale and 30 basis points over the 5.192 percent interest swap rate on LIBOR for the 2007 second quarter note sale. In addition, while the trusts in the fourth and second quarter 2007 securitizations each also issued 15.5 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at less than AAA ratings, we believed that the market for lower rated notes during the second quarter of 2008 was insufficient to permit issuance of AA, A, and BBB+ rated notes at attractive spreads. Accordingly, we decided to retain a larger residual interest in the trust for the second quarter 2008 transaction rather than having the trust offer lower rated notes. Given the further deterioration in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to postpone our planned note sale until 2009. As of the date this annual report on Form 10 K is filed, the securitization market remains extremely uncertain, and very limited current demand for securitized loans makes that market much more difficult to access than it has been in the past. We believe, nonetheless, that alternatives remain available to us to sell our timeshare notes, record note sale gains, and thereby reduce our timeshare notes receivable balances and improve our cash flow. However, we expect any transaction that we may be able to complete in the near term will be more costly to us, and result in lower note sale gains, if any, relative to the size of the transaction, than those we have experienced in previous years. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $357 million in 2008, $671 million in 2007, and $529 million in 2006 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in Cash from Operations, as noted in that section, are not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures decreased primarily due to a reduction in development spending. We expect that near term capital expenditures will be lower than 2008 levels. See the discussion of Development and Financing Risks within the Risk Factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. Although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales, if we were unable to do so, our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We also expect to continue to make other selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and minority equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $38 million in 2008, $745 million in 2007, and $798 million in 2006. In 2008, we closed on the sales of two properties, two land parcels, and an interest in an entity that leases four hotels. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2008 and 2007, amounted to net loan advances of $17 million in 2008 and net loan collections and sales of $75 million in 2007. Lodging senior loans outstanding totaled $2 million, all of which was long term, at year end 2008 and $7 million (which included a current portion of $4 million) at year end 2007. Lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled $236 million (which included a current portion of $15 million) at year end 2008 and $206 million (which included a current portion of $17 million) at year end 2007. In 2008, our notes receivable balance associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans, increased by $25 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserve against one loan. 62 Table of Contents Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $25 million in 2008, $40 million in 2007, and $95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased by $130 million in 2008, to $3,095 million at year end 2008 from $2,965 million, and reflected $969 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of $585 million, the repayment, upon maturity, of $91 million of Series E Senior Notes in the 2008 first quarter, repurchase of $109 million of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $54 million. Debt increased by $1,132 million in 2007, to $2,965 million at year end 2007 from $1,833 million, due to the issuance of $346 million (book value at issuance) of Series I Senior Notes (described more fully in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K), the issuance of $397 million (book value at issuance) of Series J Senior Notes (described more fully in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K), a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of $270 million and other debt increases of $119 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2008, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 4.8 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year end 2008. At the end of 2008, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poors and Baa2 from Moodys. See the Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities, caption within this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on our Credit Facility. In 2008, we repurchased, in the open market, $109 million of our Senior Notes, across multiple series. The debt extinguishment resulted in a gain of $28 million that was recorded for the difference between the purchase price of $77 million and the respective carrying amount of $105 million of the debt. Share Repurchases. We purchased 11.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share, 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share, and 41.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2006 at an average price of $38.13 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of year end 2008, 21.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. We do not expect share repurchase activity in 2009. Dividends. In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 17 percent to $0.0875 per share. Dividends of $115 million were paid in 2008, a 10 percent increase over 2007. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year end 2008: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 3,815 $ 238 $ 305 $ 1,910 $ 1,362 Capital lease obligations (1) 11 1 2 2 6 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,335 137 248 212 738 Non recourse 382 16 29 28 309 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 131 29 54 25 23 Other long term liabilities 104 2 6 96 Total contractual obligations $ 5,778 $ 421 $ 640 $ 2,183 $ 2,534 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. 63 Table of Contents The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year end 2008 and year end 2007 was $141 million and $132 million, respectively, and is not reflected in the Contractual Obligations table. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. It is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52 week period, but we do not anticipate that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur. See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, for additional information. The following table summarizes our commitments as of year end 2008: Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 298 $ $ 75 $ 65 $ 158 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 273 57 119 97 Total other commercial commitments $ 571 $ $ 132 $ 184 $ 255 Our guarantees where we are the primary obligor of $298 million listed in the preceding table include $33 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties, along with $3 million of debt service guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying debt has been funded. The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include $206 million of guarantees that we anticipate will expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations totaling $145 million and lifecare bonds of $61 million for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (Sunrise) is the primary obligor of the leases and $9 million of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (CNL), which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of $50 million of the lifecare bonds. Five Star is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund under the guarantees, according to recent SEC filings made by Sunrise there has been a significant deterioration in Sunrises financial position and access to liquidity; accordingly, Sunrises continued ability to meet these guarantee obligations cannot be assured. The guarantees in the preceding table for which we are secondarily liable include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $67 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of 2023. CTF Holdings Ltd. (CTF) had originally made available 35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees (approximately 7 million [$10 million] remained at year end 2008). As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $67 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $6 million. We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $460 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 20 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. At year end 2008, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million. In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. 64 Table of Contents In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year end 2008, we had extended approximately $10 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $8 million, which expire within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire in one year. At year end 2008, we also had commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North American full service and limited service properties or purchase or develop hotel anchored mixed use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $34 million within three years; and $10 million after three years. Of the $44 million in commitments, we expect to fund $29 million within one to two years and $15 million within three years. In addition, as of year end 2008, we had commitments, with no expiration date, to fund up to $25 million in joint ventures for development of new properties of which we expect to fund $13 million within one year and $12 million in one to two years. Also, as of year end 2008, we had a commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $8 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $1 million and have $7 million remaining that we do not expect to fund. And, as of year end 2008, we had a commitment to invest up to $28 million (20 million) in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to fund under this commitment. At year end 2008, we had $126 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year end 2008 totaled $465 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount of consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled $3 million at year end 2008. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Base management fees $ 49 $ 56 $ 62 Franchise fees 1 2 Incentive management fees 11 26 22 Cost reimbursements 340 510 649 Total revenue $ 400 $ 593 $ 735 General, administrative, and other $ (1 ) $ (4 ) $ (1 ) Reimbursed costs (340 ) (510 ) (649 ) Gains and other income 12 25 28 Interest expense 4 1 1 Interest income 3 4 4 (Provision for) reversal of provision for loan losses (12 ) 1 Equity in earnings 15 15 3 Provision for income taxes 1 65 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Data ($ in millions) At Year End2008 At Year End2007 Current assets accounts and notes receivable $ 23 $ 42 Deferred development 3 2 Contract acquisition costs 28 33 Equity and cost method investments 309 316 Loans to equity method investees 50 21 Other long term receivables 7 Long term deferred tax assets, net 1 Current liabilities: Other payables and accruals (9 ) (2 ) Other long term liabilities (15 ) (16 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections, which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than its estimated fair value. 66 Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that assumes certain growth projections that may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. When we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. At year end 2008, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $157 million. We had a $113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses, leaving $44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired loans was $112 million. We had a $92 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2008 and 2007, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $135 million and $102 million, respectively. Loans to Timeshare Owners In accordance with the adoption of SOP 04 2 in 2006, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 to the current year. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each years sales over the life of those notes. At year end 2008 and year end 2007, our allowance for credit losses associated with Loans to timeshare owners totaled $35 million and $19 million, respectively. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes We record the current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, as well as the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. 67 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities. We are also subject to risk from changes in equity prices from an investment in common stock, which has a carrying value of $10 million at year end 2008, which we account for as available for sale securities under FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year end 2008, we were party to the following derivative instruments: An interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap was $92 million and it matures in 2010. Four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we have been required by purchasers and or rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps was $111 million, and they expire through 2022. Two interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted timeshare note sales. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was $149 million at year end 2008, and they expire in 2012. Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts and fees denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was approximately $89 million, and they expire in 2009 and 2010. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was $190 million at year end 2008 and they expire in 2009. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign operations. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the investments remaining at year end 2008 was $15 million and they expire in 2009. 68 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments as of year end 2008: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
