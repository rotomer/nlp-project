Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,420 properties (595,461 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year end 2009 and include 30 home and condominium products (3,034 units) for which we manage the related owners associations. In addition, we provided 2,072 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand alone basis under The Ritz Carlton brand (The Ritz Carlton Residences), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (The Ritz Carlton Destination Club and Grand Residences by Marriott Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Lodging Weak economic conditions in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world, instability in the financial markets following the worldwide financial crisis that began in 2008, and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2009. Lodging demand in the United States, as well as internationally, remained soft throughout 2009, as a result of weak economic conditions, while hotel room supply increased in several markets. Demand for our luxury properties remained particularly weak. Outside the United States, concerns in the latter half of 2009 regarding the H1N1 virus also hurt demand, particularly in Mexico, as well as in some markets in Asia, the Caribbean and South America. We experienced continued weakness in 2009 associated with both group and business transient demand. New group meeting cancellations moderated progressively throughout 2009 as compared to the 2008 fourth quarter. New near term group bookings remain soft, although they improved somewhat, particularly in the 2009 fourth quarter. While we continued to experience significant attrition rates in 2009 from expected attendance at meetings, that moderated somewhat in the latter half of 2009. Non corporate demand, which remained weak in the 2009 first quarter, improved in the 2009 second quarter and even more so in the 2009 third and fourth quarters, largely as a result of significant promotional efforts and discounting aimed at replacing weak corporate business with leisure, government, and other discounted transient business. Through these challenging times, our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by driving revenue, increasing our market share and managing costs. Responding to the weak demand environment for hotel rooms, we continue to deploy a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase both property level revenue and market share. We monitor market conditions continuously and are able to quickly institute high impact and low cost sales promotions as needed. These promotions are designed both to reward and retain loyal customers and to attract new guests. www.Marriott.com and our loyal Marriott Rewards member base are both low cost and high impact vehicles for our revenue generation efforts. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we also implemented sales associate, meeting planner, and customer incentives to close on new group business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating with our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and through our blog Marriott on the Move. We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base. With a goal of continuing to improve the overall guest service experience, we improved www.Marriott.com in 2009 by redesigning the website to significantly enhance its functionality and modernize its appearance. 25 Table of Contents Properties in our system instituted and are maintaining very tight cost controls. Given the current weak demand environment, we continue to work aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property level house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, relaxing some brand standards for hotels, cross training personnel, utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible, eliminating certain positions, and not filling some vacant positions. We have also reduced above property costs, which are allocated to hotels, by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we have eliminated or not filled certain above property positions, and have encouraged, or, where legally permitted, required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year end 2009, 46 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 52 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, we maintain financial flexibility by minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Company operated house profit margin is the ratio of property level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. For our North American comparable company operated properties, RevPAR decreased by 18.5 percent in 2009, compared to 2008, reflecting weakness in most markets. Our 2009 fiscal year began on January 3, 2009, and included 52 weeks while the prior year included 53 weeks and two New Years holidays. If RevPAR for 2008 was calculated for the 52 week period ended January 2, 2009, RevPAR would have declined by an average of 19.3 percent for our North American comparable company operated properties. For our comparable managed properties outside North America, RevPAR for 2009 decreased 18.0 percent versus 2008, with weakness in most markets around the world. Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins for 2009 decreased by 380 basis points reflecting the impact of RevPAR declines from weak demand, partially offset by strong cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system. Timeshare Weak economic conditions, instability in the financial markets, and low consumer confidence also kept demand for timeshare intervals soft in 2009. Demand for fractional and residential units was particularly weak. As a result, we slowed or canceled some development projects and closed less efficient timeshare sales offices in 2008 and 2009. We also increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives and eliminated or did not fill certain positions in 2008 and 2009. During the 2009 second and third quarters, we were able to increase sales over the 2009 first quarter through various sales promotions, including pricing adjustments. As with Lodging, our Timeshare properties have instituted very tight cost controls, and we have eliminated or not filled certain positions, and have encouraged, or, where legally permitted, required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. For additional information on our company wide restructuring efforts, see our Restructuring Costs and Other Charges caption later in this Managements Discussion and Analysis section. In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segments businesses continued to experience, we evaluated our entire Timeshare segment portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September 22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment spending. These decisions resulted in our recording 2009 third quarter pretax charges totaling $752 million ($502 million after tax). We discuss these charges in more detail under the caption Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges later in this Managements Discussion and Analysis section. 26 Table of Contents Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage of completion accounting method, soft demand frequently is not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also reduce nearer term Timeshare segment results as percentage of completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information rich and easy to use website, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary website, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property level reservations via this cost efficient channel. We have added other languages to www.Marriott.com, and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions. See the Risk Factors section of this report for important information regarding forward looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2009, 2008, and 2007. Continuing Operations Revenues 2009 Compared to 2008 Revenues decreased by $1,971 million (15 percent) to $10,908 million in 2009 from $12,879 million in 2008, as a result of lower: cost reimbursements revenue ($1,152 million); Timeshare sales and service revenue ($300 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($206 million); incentive management fees ($157 million (comprised of $108 million for North America and $49 million outside of North America)); base management fees ($105 million (comprised of $79 million for North America and $26 million outside of North America)); and franchise fees ($51 million). The decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,682 million in 2009 from $8,834 million in 2008, reflected lower property level costs, in response to lower occupancy and cost controls, partially offset by the impact of growth across the system. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. We added 35 managed properties (8,574 rooms) and 200 franchised properties (25,136 rooms) to our system in 2009, net of properties exiting the system. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue of $300 million (21 percent), to $1,123 million in 2009, from $1,423 million in 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to the 2008 fiscal year and higher financing revenue. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,019 million in 2009, from $1,225 million in 2008, largely reflected $183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $70 million and $64 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected RevPAR declines associated with weak lodging demand. The decrease in incentive management fees, to $154 million in 2009 from $311 million in 2008, reflected lower property level revenue, associated with weak demand, lower RevPAR, and the associated lower property level operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotels owner. With particularly weak demand and low property level operating income in 2009, most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee. In 2009, only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us, as compared to 56 percent in 2008. The decreases in base management fees, to $530 million in 2009 from $635 million in 2008, and franchise fees, to $400 million in 2009 from $451 million in 2008, both reflected RevPAR declines driven by weaker demand, partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system. 27 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Revenues decreased by $111 million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system. Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2007; and (2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher property level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the BUSINESS SEGMENTS discussion later in this report for additional information. The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels. Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from $8,575 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system. Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segments timeshare, luxury residential, and luxury fractional real estate development businesses continued to experience, we evaluated our entire Timeshare portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September 22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to take the following actions: (1) for our luxury residential projects, reduce prices, convert certain proposed projects to other uses, sell some undeveloped land, and not pursue further Marriott funded residential development projects; (2) reduce prices for existing luxury fractional units; (3) continue short term promotions for our U.S. timeshare business and defer the introduction of new projects and development phases; and (4) for our European timeshare and fractional resorts, continue promotional pricing and marketing incentives and not pursue further development. We designed these plans, which primarily relate to luxury residential and fractional resorts, to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment spending. As a result of these decisions, in 2009, we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income ($502 million after tax), including $614 million of pretax charges impacting operating income under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption, and $138 million of pretax charges impacting non operating income under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments that we expected to fund in 2010. 28 Table of Contents The following table details the composition of these charges. ($ in millions) Impairment Charge 2009 Operating Income Charge Inventory impairment $ 529 Property and equipment impairment 64 Other impairments 21 Total operating income charge 614 2009 Non Operating Income Charge Joint venture impairment 71 Loan impairment 40 Funding liability 27 Total non operating income charge 138 Total $ 752 For additional information related to these impairment charges, including how these impairments were determined and the impairment charges grouped by product type and or geographic location, see Footnote No. 20, Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges. Restructuring Costs and Other Charges During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008 (although we did complete a note sale in the first quarter of 2009). These declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we put certain company wide cost saving measures in place in response to these declines, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost saving measures. Upper level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, lodging development, and above property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also recorded $137 million of other charges in the 2008 fourth quarter. For information regarding the fourth quarter 2008 charges, see Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for 2008 (2008 Form 10 K). Restructuring Costs As part of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our Timeshare segment, hotel development, above property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. For additional information on these restructuring costs, including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment, a roll forward of the restructuring liability, and cumulative restructuring costs to date since inception of the restructuring, please see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges. As a result of our Timeshare segments restructuring efforts, we are projecting $112 million to $117 million ($68 million to $72 million after tax) of annual cost savings in 2010. In 2009 we realized approximately $80 million to $85 million ($48 million to $52 million after tax) compared to the $70 million to $80 million we had projected for 2009. The 2009 savings primarily were, and we expect that future savings will primarily be, reflected in the Timeshare direct and the General, administrative, and other expense captions in our Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our Lodging segments, we are projecting approximately $12 million ($7 million after tax) of annual cost savings in 2010. In 2009, we realized $9 million ($5 million after tax) of savings. The 2009 savings primarily were, and we expect that future savings will primarily be, reflected in the General, administrative, and other expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The restructuring initiatives we implemented by reducing above property level lodging management personnel and corporate overhead are projected to result in $10 million to $11 million ($6 million to $7 million after tax) of annual cost savings in 2010, and in 2009 we realized all of the $8 million ($5 million after tax) of savings we had projected for 2009. These savings primarily were, and are expected to be, reflected in the General, administrative, and other expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 29 Table of Contents We anticipate that the remaining restructuring liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid by the third quarter of 2010 for the Timeshare segment and by the fourth quarter of 2010 for hotel development and for above property level management. The amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities in the Timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2014. The remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by year end 2010. Other Charges We also incurred $162 million of other charges in 2009, which include $100 million recorded in the General, administrative, and other expense caption, a net $23 million recorded in Timeshare sales and services, net of direct expenses and $39 million of joint venture impairments recorded in the Equity in (losses) earnings caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. The charges recorded in the General, administrative, and other expense caption include: (1) $49 million security deposit impairment; (2) $43 million in loan impairments now classified in General, administrative and other; (3) $11 million reversal of the related expected funding liability; (4) $4 million of accounts receivable and guarantee charges; (5) $7 million software development write off; and (6) $8 million other asset impairment to write off contract acquisition costs related to one property. The charges recorded in the Timeshare sales and services caption and Timeshare sales and services, net of direct expenses include: (1) $20 million in charges related to residual interest valuation; and (2) net contract cancellation allowances of $3 million. For a detailed discussion of these charges, as well as a table summarizing them by type, please see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges. Also, for segment discussion of these charges, see the Business Segments caption that follows. Operating Income 2009 Compared to 2008 Operating income decreased by $917 million (120 percent) to an operating loss of $152 million in 2009 from operating income of $765 million in 2008. The decrease in operating income reflected Timeshare strategy impairment charges in 2009 of $614 million, $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees, $69 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs of $4 million. In the preceding Revenues section, we note the reasons for the decrease of $157 million in incentive management fees as well as the decrease of $156 million in combined base management and franchise fees as compared to 2008. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2009 totaled $83 million. The decline of $6 million (7 percent) from $89 million in 2008 primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe. Higher financing revenue net of financing expenses reflected higher note sale gains, increased residual interest accretion, a decrease in the adjustment to the fair market value of residual interests, and a decrease in the cost of financing, partially offset by lower interest income. Lower services revenue net of expenses reflected weak demand for rentals and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare later in this section for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $69 million (50 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to a decline of $65 million in revenue, net of expenses primarily associated with weaker demand at owned and leased properties, as well as our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated, during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $81 million (10 percent) to $722 million in 2009 from $803 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflected $186 million of lower expenses, largely due to cost savings generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008 and lower incentive compensation as well as a $12 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008. Additionally, in 2009 we reached final settlement regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment and recorded a $3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the General, administrative, and other expense caption on our Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional 30 Table of Contents information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2008 Form 10 K. These benefits were partially offset by the following items: $49 million of impairment charges for two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls; 2009 provisions for loan losses of $43 million for two loans partially offset by a $22 million favorable variance from a 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan, (as discussed in Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, these provisions for loan losses are now part of General, administrative and other); an $8 million impairment charge related to the write off of contract acquisition costs for one property; a $7 million write off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; $12 million of expenses primarily related to write offs of other assets that we deemed non recoverable, performance cure accruals, and guarantee accruals associated with 12 hotels; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. Additionally, 2009 included a $15 million unfavorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to a $28 million favorable impact in 2008, both of which reflected mark to market valuations. Of the $81 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, $1 million increase was attributable to our Lodging segments, $31 million decrease was attributable to our Timeshare segment, and $51 million decrease was unallocated. 2008 Compared to 2007 Operating income decreased by $418 million (35 percent) to $765 million in 2008 from $1,183 million in 2007. The decrease in operating income reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $41 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, and a $30 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of $27 million. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled $89 million. The decline of $261 million (75 percent) from the prior year primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue, net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential products, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a $22 million pretax impairment charge ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit), start up costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds, as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. The decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008, compared to the prior year. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $41 million (23 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $21 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, $4 million of lower termination fees, and $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. Partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling $6 million in 2008 associated with one property, compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of $8 million associated with that same property that was reclassified from held for sale to held and used. General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $30 million (4 percent) to $803 million in 2008 from $773 million in 2007. This increase reflected the following items: $44 million of increased expenses associated with, among other things, our unit growth and development, systems improvements, and initiatives to enhance our brands globally; a $16 million charge for certain guarantees; an unfavorable $9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007; $12 million in write offs in 2008 of costs related to development cancellations; $4 million of increased foreign exchange losses; $4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable; and a $15 million increase in provision for loan losses, reflecting a $22 million 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan (see the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information) and a $3 million loan loss provision associated with one property, partially offset by favorable variances associated with a $5 million provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a Delta Airlines lease and the reversal of $5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid (as discussed in Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, those provisions for loan losses are now part of General, administrative and other). See Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees, development cancellation write offs, bad debt reserves, and provision for loan losses. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of $35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of 31 Table of Contents issues raised during the examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor of our employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) feature of our Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust (the Plan). See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, in our 2008 Form 10 K for additional information on the ESOP settlement. Additionally, 2008 included a $28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to an $11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year, both of which reflected mark to market valuations. Of the $30 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses, an increase of $38 million was attributable to our Lodging segments, an increase of $13 million was attributable to our Timeshare segment, and a decrease of $21 million, primarily reflecting the 2007 ESOP settlement charge, was unallocated. The reasons for the decrease of $58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of $27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding Revenues section. Gains and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Gain on debt extinguishment $ 21 $ 28 $ Gains on sales of real estate and other 10 14 39 Other note sale/repayment gains 1 Gains on forgiveness of debt 12 Gain/(loss) on sale of joint venture and other investments 3 (1 ) 31 Income/(loss) from cost method joint ventures 2 (3 ) 14 Impairment of equity securities (5 ) $ 31 $ 38 $ 97 2009 Compared to 2008 The $21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of Senior Notes we repurchased during the period. For additional information on the debt extinguishment, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section later in this report. The $5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements. 2008 Compared to 2007 The $28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our Senior Notes we repurchased. For additional information on the debt extinguishment, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section later in this report. The $25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a $23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our International segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008. The $12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the 2007 Compared to 2006 section in our 2008 Form 10 K. Gain on sale of joint venture and other investments of $31 million in 2007 reflected an $18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling $13 million on the sale of joint venture investments. Income from cost method joint ventures decreased $17 million to a loss of $3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be other than temporarily impaired (see the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information). Interest Expense 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest expense decreased by $45 million (28 percent) to $118 million in 2009 compared to $163 million in 2008. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our $2.4 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (our Credit Facility) decreased by $25 million reflecting the repayment of our commercial paper in 2008 and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. We also benefited from a $26 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, and the repurchase of some of our Senior Notes across multiple series in the 2008 fourth quarter and 2009 first quarter (see Liquidity and Capital Resources later in this section for additional information), which resulted in a $12 million reduction to interest expense, and finally, other interest expense decreases of $5 million. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a $23 million unfavorable variance to 2008 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2009 associated with construction projects. 32 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest expense decreased by $21 million (11 percent) to $163 million in 2008 compared to $184 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year reflected a charge of $13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the ESOP settlement in 2007. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding, lower interest rates on commercial paper, and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. As a result, year over year interest expense was lower by $7 million. We also benefited from a $15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners as a result of lower interest rates, a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects, and the maturity of our Series E Senior Notes in early 2008 yielding a $6 million favorable variance to the prior year. The write off of $2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008. These favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the Series I and Series J Senior Notes issuances, which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by $30 million. Interest Income and Income Tax 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest income decreased by $14 million (36 percent) to $25 million in 2009, from $39 million in 2008, primarily reflecting $8 million of interest income we recorded in 2008 for three loans that subsequently became impaired. Because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on these impaired loans in 2009. The decline in interest income also reflected $5 million of lower interest income due to a decline in interest rates on our cash balances, $2 million of previously reserved interest income collected in 2008, and $2 million of lower interest income in 2009 reflecting a reduction in principal due associated with one loan, partially offset by $4 million of additional interest income from new loans funded at year end 2008 and in 2009. As noted earlier in the Operating Income discussion, we now classify the 2009 and 2008 provisions for loan losses as General, administrative, and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our tax provision decreased by $415 million (119 percent) to a benefit of $65 million in 2009 from a provision of $350 million in 2008, reflecting a pretax loss in 2009 and $43 million of lower tax expense associated with our deferred compensation plan. The decrease was partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate in 2009 due to a change in our mix of worldwide income resulting from substantial reductions of foreign income in jurisdictions with low tax rates. The 2009 tax rate also reflected $52 million of income tax expense, primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries, an issue that is the subject of ongoing discussions between us and the IRS. The charges recorded in 2009 primarily relate to our ongoing current fiscal year exposure related to this issue. In addition to tax expense on pretax earnings, tax expense for 2008 also reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries. 2008 Compared to 2007 Interest income increased by $1 million (3 percent) to $39 million from $38 million in the prior year. As noted earlier in the Operating Income discussion and later in Footnote No. 1, Significant Accounting Policies, we now classify the 2008 provision for loan losses and $5 million of the $17 million 2007 provision for loan losses as General, administrative, and other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also now classify the remaining $12 million of the 2007 provision for loan losses as Equity in (losses) earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as discussed under that caption later in this section. Our tax provision decreased by $91 million (21 percent) to $350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of $441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008, a 2007 charge for a German legislative tax change, and $6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the ESOP settlement. This decrease was partially offset by $39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008. The higher 2008 tax rate reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries. 33 Table of Contents Equity in (Losses) Earnings 2009 Compared to 2008 Equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 increased by $81 million from equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 and primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired (see the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for more information). The decrease in joint venture equity earnings also reflected an unfavorable comparison to $15 million of equity earnings in 2008 from a joint venture that sold portfolio assets and had significant associated gains, and $5 million of earnings in 2008 from another joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture. Further contributing to the decline were $24 million of decreased earnings in 2009 for a Timeshare segment joint venture residential and fractional project, $7 million of equity losses associated with a North American Limited Service segment joint venture, a $3 million impairment and $2 million of other equity losses associated with an International segment joint venture, and $9 million of equity losses at certain other joint ventures, all of which were negatively affected by the weak demand environment. The unfavorable impacts also included a $3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that is not allocated to one of our segments and for which we do not expect to recover our investment. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate and a 2008 impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development. See the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, for more information on some of these joint venture impairments. 2008 Compared to 2007 Equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 decreased $12 million from earnings of $3 million in 2007 and primarily reflected $14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture, which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains, $10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to start up costs in the prior year, and $5 million of increased earnings from an International segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008, partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate, an impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development, and a $7 million impact related to contract cancellation allowances recorded at one Timeshare segment joint venture (see the Other Charges section of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information on the impairment and contract cancellation allowances). In 2007, we also recorded a $12 million loan loss provision related to one property where we have a joint venture investment that is not allocated to one of our segments, which as discussed in Footnote No. 1, Significant Accounting Policies, we now classify under the Equity in (losses) earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Net Losses Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 2009 Compared to 2008 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $8 million in 2009 to $7 million, compared to $15 million in 2008. The benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of $7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners share of losses totaling $11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners share of tax benefits of $4 million associated with the losses. 2008 Compared to 2007 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $14 million in 2008 to $15 million. The benefits for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2008 of $15 million are net of tax and reflected our partners share of losses totaling $24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners share of tax benefits of $9 million associated with the losses. (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations 2009 Compared to 2008 Compared to the prior year, loss from continuing operations increased by $697 million (203 percent) to a 2009 loss of $353 million from 2008 income of $344 million, loss from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $705 million (196 percent) to a 2009 loss of $346 million from 2008 income of $359 million, and diluted losses per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $1.94 (200 percent) to $0.97 per share from earnings of $0.97 per share. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the $697 million increase in loss from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to 2009 Timeshare strategy impairment charges ($752 million), lower incentive management fees ($157 million), lower base management and franchise fees ($156 million), lower equity in earnings ($81 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other 34 Table of Contents revenue net of direct expenses ($69 million), lower interest income ($14 million), lower gains and other income ($7 million), and lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($6 million). Lower income taxes ($415 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million), lower interest expense ($45 million), and lower restructuring costs ($4 million) partially offset the unfavorable variances. 2008 Compared to 2007 Compared to the prior year, income from continuing operations decreased by $352 million (51 percent) to $344 million in 2008, income from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $338 million (48 percent) to $359 million in 2008, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott decreased by $0.76 (44 percent) to $0.97. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income, the decrease in income from continuing operations versus the prior year was due to lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($261 million), lower gains and other income ($59 million), lower incentive management fees ($58 million), restructuring costs recorded in 2008 ($55 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($41 million), and higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($30 million). Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were lower income taxes ($91 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($27 million), lower interest expense ($21 million), higher equity in earnings ($12 million), and higher interest income ($1 million). Business Segments We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. In 2007, we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. See Footnote No. 19, Business Segments for further information on: (1) our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment, and other information about each segment, including: revenues; (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Marriott; net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests; and equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees; (2) revenues, financial results, and fixed assets associated with operations outside the United States; and (3) selling expenses. 35 Table of Contents At year end 2009, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,072 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non U.S. Total U.S. Non U.S. Total North American Full Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 322 13 335 125,863 4,837 130,700 Marriott Conference Centers 11 11 3,243 3,243 JW Marriott 15 1 16 7,902 221 8,123 Renaissance Hotels 77 2 79 28,569 786 29,355 Renaissance ClubSport 2 2 349 349 427 16 443 165,926 5,844 171,770 North American Limited Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 768 16 784 107,640 2,847 110,487 Fairfield Inn & Suites 620 8 628 55,622 903 56,525 SpringHill Suites 255 1 256 29,846 124 29,970 Residence Inn 591 16 607 70,995 2,308 73,303 TownePlace Suites 184 184 18,451 18,451 2,418 41 2,459 282,554 6,182 288,736 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 152 156 2,765 43,584 46,349 JW Marriott 1 26 27 387 9,953 10,340 Renaissance Hotels 62 62 20,878 20,878 Courtyard 74 74 14,719 14,719 Fairfield Inn & Suites 1 1 206 206 Residence Inn 1 1 109 109 Marriott Executive Apartments 23 23 3,880 3,880 5 339 344 3,152 93,329 96,481 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz Carlton 40 34 74 12,115 10,171 22,286 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts 2 2 117 117 The Ritz Carlton Residential (2) 25 1 26 2,613 93 2,706 The Ritz Carlton Serviced Apartments 3 3 474 474 65 40 105 14,728 10,855 25,583 Timeshare Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 41 11 52 9,728 2,126 11,854 The Ritz Carlton Destination Club 7 2 9 339 122 461 The Ritz Carlton Residences (2) 3 1 4 222 15 237 Grand Residences by Marriott Fractional 1 1 2 199 49 248 Grand Residences by Marriott Residential (1), (2) 2 2 91 91 54 15 69 10,579 2,312 12,891 Total 2,969 451 3,420 476,939 118,522 595,461 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

Products in active sales may not be ready for occupancy. 36 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 We added 254 properties (37,714 rooms) and 17 properties (3,476 rooms) exited the system in 2009, not including residential products. We also added 5 residential properties (568 units) in 2009. Total segment financial results decreased by $1,162 million (100 percent) to $4 million in 2009 from $1,166 million in 2008, and total segment revenues decreased by $1,986 million to $10,831 million in 2009, a 15 percent decrease from total segment revenues of $12,817 million in 2008. As discussed in more detail earlier in this report, demand was weaker in 2009 than 2008. The decrease in revenues included a $1,152 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2008, reflected $685 million of Timeshare impairment charges ($614 million of which were reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption and $71 million of which we reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Timeshare strategy impairment charges section for more information on the impairments), $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined 2009 base management and franchise fees, $85 million of owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $63 million of lower equity joint venture results, $18 million of higher restructuring costs, a $13 million decrease in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interests benefit, a decrease of $9 million in gains and other income, and a decrease of $6 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $30 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses. As discussed in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section, these decreases included $80 million in other charges, with $57 million recorded in general, administrative, and other expenses and $23 million recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. The $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees reflected lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR in 2009. Incentive management fees decreased by $157 million and reflected lower property level operating revenues and margins associated with weak demand, somewhat offset by property level cost controls. With lower property level operating income, many managed properties did not earn sufficient income to achieve owner priority returns and, as a result, we earned no incentive fees from those properties. In 2009, 67 percent of our incentive fees were derived from hotels outside North America versus 49 percent in 2008. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties decreased by 17.2 percent, and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties decreased by 18.5 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties decreased by 17.9 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties decreased by 18.0 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties decreased by 17.3 percent (18.4 percent using actual dollars) and worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties decreased by 18.3 percent (20.0 percent using actual dollars). Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2009 decreased by 380 basis points and worldwide comparable company operated house profit per available room (HP PAR) decreased by 25.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of very tight cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year over year RevPAR decreases. International company operated house profit margins declined by 270 basis points, and HP PAR at our International managed properties decreased by 22.0 percent reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. North American company operated house profit margins declined by 440 basis points, and HP PAR at our North American managed properties decreased by 27.7 percent also reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. HP PAR at our North American limited service managed properties decreased by 28.7 percent, reflecting cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. 2008 Compared to 2007 We added 215 properties (32,842 rooms) and 42 properties (7,525 rooms) exited the system in 2008, not including residential products. We also added six residential properties (567 units) in 2008. Total segment financial results decreased by $422 million (27 percent) to $1,166 million in 2008 from $1,588 million in the prior year, and total segment revenues decreased by $92 million to $12,817 million in 2008, a 1 percent decrease from revenues of $12,909 million in 2007. While demand was weaker in 2008 compared to 2007, international and full service properties experienced stronger demand than luxury and limited service properties. The decrease in revenues included a $259 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. The results, 37 Table of Contents compared to the year ago period, reflected a decrease of $261 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $58 million of lower incentive management fees, $51 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, a decrease of $37 million in gains and other income, $29 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, a decrease of $22 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $14 million of lower equity joint venture results. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $27 million (3 percent) increase in combined base management and franchise fees to $1,086 million in the 2008 period from $1,059 million in 2007 and a $23 million increase in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests. Higher RevPAR for comparable rooms, resulting from rate increases in international markets, and new unit growth drove the increase in base management and franchise fees. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Compared to 2007, incentive management fees decreased by $58 million (16 percent) in 2008 and reflected the recognition in 2007 of $17 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2007. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 also included $13 million of business interruption insurance proceeds, also associated with hurricanes in prior years. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property level profitability due to lower RevPAR, higher property level wages and benefits costs, and utilities costs, particularly in North America. In 2008, 56 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 67 percent in 2007. In addition, in 2008, 49 percent of our incentive fees were derived from international hotels versus 35 percent in 2007. Systemwide RevPAR, which includes data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties, for comparable North American properties decreased by 2.7 percent and RevPAR for our comparable North American company operated properties decreased by 2.9 percent. Systemwide RevPAR for comparable international properties increased by 3.6 percent, and RevPAR for comparable international company operated properties increased by 3.3 percent. Worldwide RevPAR for comparable systemwide properties decreased by 1.5 percent (0.8 percent using actual dollars) while worldwide RevPAR for comparable company operated properties decreased by 1.1 percent (0.2 percent using actual dollars). Compared to the year ago period, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2008 decreased by 70 basis points, reflecting the impact of stronger year over year RevPAR associated with international properties and very tight cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year over year RevPAR decreases associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and also higher expenses in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. North American company operated house profit margins declined by 140 basis points reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand and higher operating costs, including those associated with wages and benefits and utilities. For 2008, HP PAR at our North American managed properties decreased by 5.8 percent. HP PAR at our North American limited service managed properties decreased by 8.0 percent, and worldwide HP PAR for all our brands increased by 2.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis. Lodging Development We opened 254 properties, totaling 37,714 rooms, across our brands in 2009 and 17 properties (3,476 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. We also added 5 residential properties (568 units). Highlights of the year included: Converting 19 properties (3,989 rooms), or 10 percent of our gross room additions for the year, from other brands, and 13 percent of those rooms were located in international markets; Opening approximately 23 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; Adding 207 properties (24,346 rooms) to our North American Limited Service brands; and Opening two new Marriott Vacation Club properties, one in Marco Island, Florida, and the other in Bangkok, Thailand. We also opened one Ritz Carlton Destination Club property and one Ritz Carlton Residences property in Kapalua Bay, Hawaii, one Ritz Carlton Destination Club property in Lake Tahoe, California, and one Grand Residences by Marriott property in Kauai, Hawaii. We currently have approximately 100,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add 25,000 to 30,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2010. 38 Table of Contents We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report. Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full Service and North American Limited Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company operated Fairfield Inn & Suites properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties, as the brand is predominantly franchised, and such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2009 include the 52 weeks from January 3, 2009, through January 1, 2010, for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through January 2, 2009, and for 2007 include the 52 weeks from December 30, 2006, through December 28, 2007 (except in each case, for The Ritz Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 39 Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2009 Change vs. 2008 2009 Change vs. 2008 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 66.3 % 4.3 % pts. 63.4 % 4.6 % pts.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Segment revenues $ 4,848 $ 5,631 $ 5,476 14 % 3 % Segment results $ 272 $ 419 $ 478 35 % 12 % 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (3,645 rooms) and 3 properties (800 rooms) left the system. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties decreased by 17.0 percent to $103.87, occupancy decreased by 4.3 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.6 percent to $157.10. The $147 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $71 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, a $15 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $3 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $4 million increase in gains and other income. The $71 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property level cost controls. Fifty one properties paid incentive fees in 2009 compared to 101 in 2008. The $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was primarily driven by lower RevPAR. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, decreased $15 million and primarily reflected $18 million of net losses in 2009 associated with several properties with weak demand, partially offset by a favorable variance of $3 million related to a property that was being renovated, and as a result was not operating at full capacity during 2008. The $4 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with one property that was sold for a loss in the 2008 period. The $3 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected an $8 million impairment charge related to the write off of contract acquisition costs for one property and a $7 million impairment charge related to a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 (see the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for more information), which were mostly offset by $12 million in cost reductions. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service segment properties totaled $4,322 million in 2009, compared to $4,951 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 15 properties (4,611 rooms) and three properties (493 rooms) left the system. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American full service properties decreased by 1.6 percent to $123.98, occupancy decreased by 2.0 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 1.2 percent to $176.30. The $59 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, primarily reflected a $35 million decrease in incentive management fees and a $25 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $2 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was in part due to the recognition, in 2007, of business interruption insurance proceeds totaling $12 million associated with Hurricane Katrina and also reflected lower demand and property level margins in 2008 compared to 2007. The slight increase of $2 million in base management and franchise fees was a product of unit growth and an additional week of sales, mostly offset by lower RevPAR. The decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses of $25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable $7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008, $8 million of losses associated with three properties, one of which was a new property that opened in 2008, $5 million of lower contract termination fees received, $2 million of lower land rent income, and an unfavorable $3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property. 46 Table of Contents Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service segment properties totaled $4,951 million in 2008, compared to $4,782 million in 2007. North American Limited Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Segment revenues $ 1,986 $ 2,233 $ 2,198 11 % 2 % Segment results $ 265 $ 395 $ 461 33 % 14 % 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 207 properties (24,346 rooms) and 4 properties (588 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were mainly franchised hotels associated with our Fairfield Inn & Suites brand. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties decreased by 20.0 percent to $68.83, occupancy for these properties decreased by 5.8 percentage points to 63.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 12.7 percent to $108.33. The $130 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected $59 million of lower base management and franchise fees, $35 million of lower incentive management fees, $17 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $9 million of lower joint venture equity earnings, $6 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The $59 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was largely due to lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR, partially offset by new unit growth. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins resulting from weak demand, partially offset by property level cost controls. Twenty three properties paid incentive fees in 2009, compared to 256 in 2008. The $17 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million in lower revenue and property level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties and $6 million of lower property level margins associated with our corporate housing business. The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected equity losses at one of our joint ventures as the related properties experienced weak demand. The $4 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $42 million impairment charge related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, mostly offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls (see the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for more information). The net increase of $16 million associated with the 2008 accrual and 2009 impairment charge was partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily reflecting cost reductions that were part of our cost containment efforts. The $6 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividend distributions in the current year from one joint venture, which had a decline in available cash flow as a result of the weak demand environment. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service segment properties totaled $1,419 million in 2009, compared to $1,541 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 168 properties (19,747 rooms) and 21 properties (2,519 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were primarily associated with our Fairfield Inn & Suites brand. 47 Table of Contents In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American limited service properties decreased by 4.2 percent to $85.83, occupancy decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 69.4 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 0.5 percent to $123.69. The $66 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected $43 million of lower incentive management fees, $14 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $13 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower gains and other income, partially offset by a $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees. The $10 million increase in base management and franchise fees was largely due to unit growth, partially offset by a decrease in relicensing fees. The $43 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins and the recognition, in 2007, of $15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods results, but not earned and due until 2007. The $14 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected a $15 million charge related to a shortfall funding under a guarantee (see the Other Charges caption in Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information). The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $6 million of franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007, which were primarily associated with Fairfield Inn & Suites brand properties that left our system, and $7 million of lower income due to lower revenue and property level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service segment properties totaled $1,541 million in 2008, compared to $1,470 million in 2007.

Annual Change ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Segment revenues $ 1,145 $ 1,544 $ 1,594 26 % 3 % Segment results $ 129 $ 246 $ 271 48 % 9 % 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our International Lodging segment, we added 30 properties (8,734 rooms) and 8 properties (1,714 rooms) left the system largely due to quality issues. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties decreased by 18.0 percent to $108.45, occupancy for these properties decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 66.3 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.9 percent to $163.64. RevPAR declined in most markets around the world. The $117 million decrease in segment results in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $45 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, an $8 million decrease in gains and other income, a decrease of $9 million in joint venture equity earnings, and $2 million in restructuring costs, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses. The $45 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level margins, driven by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to 2008, partially offset by property level cost controls. The $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was driven mainly by lower RevPAR, impacted by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, somewhat offset by the impact of new room additions. The $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $23 million of weaker results, driven by weak demand and lower RevPAR at some owned and leased properties, $13 million of lower termination fees, and $3 million of lower income reflecting conversions from leased properties to managed properties. The $8 million decrease in gains and other income reflected miscellaneous gain activity in 2008 that did not occur in 2009. Restructuring costs totaling $2 million reflected severance and fringe benefit costs. See the Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges for more information. 48 Table of Contents The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings was primarily driven by a $3 million impairment charge and $12 million in lower equity results at three joint ventures primarily reflecting lower demand. See Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges for more information on the joint venture impairment. The decrease also reflected an $11 million unfavorable impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures in 2008. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $15 million in cost reductions due to our cost containment efforts, partially offset by $3 million in guarantee reserves for two properties. See the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for more information. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $529 million in 2009, compared to $707 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our International Lodging segment, we added 21 properties (6,619 rooms) and 16 properties (3,905 rooms) left the system, primarily due to quality issues. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased by 2.6 percent to $131.00, occupancy for these properties decreased by 2.4 percentage points to 72.5 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.0 percent to $180.81. Results for our international operations were favorable across most regions, but weakened progressively throughout 2008 and especially in the fourth quarter. RevPAR increases compared to the prior year were strongest in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. The $25 million decrease in segment results in 2008, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected a $32 million decrease in gains and other income, a $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and a decrease of $5 million in joint venture equity earnings, partially offset by an $18 million increase in incentive management fees and an $11 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses remained unchanged in 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in fees was largely due to higher RevPAR, driven by rate increases and, to a lesser extent, reflected unit growth and cost control plans, which increased property level margins and incentive management fees. The $32 million decrease in gains and other income in 2008, compared to 2007, reflected the recognition of gains totaling $9 million in 2008, compared to gains in 2007 of $41 million. The 2007 gains primarily reflected a $10 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture and a gain totaling $23 million associated with sales of real estate. The $15 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected higher wage and benefit costs and costs associated with unit growth and development. Joint venture equity results were lower than the prior year by $5 million primarily reflecting an unfavorable $11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct of expenses remained unchanged and reflected $17 million of lower income, reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties, which was completely offset by $11 million of stronger results at some properties, $5 million of higher termination fees, and $1 million of higher branding fees. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $707 million in 2008, compared to $741 million in 2007. 49 Table of Contents Luxury Lodging includes The Ritz Carlton and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Segment revenues $ 1,413 $ 1,659 $ 1,576 15 % 5 % Segment results $ 17 $ 78 $ 72 78 % 8 % 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 5 properties (916 rooms) and 1 property (374 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added 3 residential products (453 units) in 2009. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties decreased by 22.7 percent to $175.66, occupancy for these properties decreased by 6.8 percentage points to 59.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 13.8 percent to $295.11. Luxury Lodging has been particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business. The $61 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected a $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, a $17 million decrease in base management fees, $13 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $6 million decrease in incentive management fees, and $5 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses. The $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired, partially offset by a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for more information). The $17 million decrease in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR declines associated with weaker demand. The $6 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property level cost controls and new unit growth. The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of lower results at three properties driven by weak demand and the resulting RevPAR declines in 2009 and $6 million of lower residential branding fees. The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2009 reflected $4 million in bad debt expense related to an accounts receivable balance we deemed to be uncollectible, $5 million of expenses primarily related to write offs of other assets that we deemed non recoverable, $3 million in start up costs related to a new brand, and a $2 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by $9 million in cost reductions related to our cost containment efforts. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,143 million in 2009, compared to $1,350 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 In 2008, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added four properties (1,195 rooms) and one property (517 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added seven residential products (654 units) in 2008. In 2008, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties decreased by 0.1 percent to $225.87, occupancy for these properties decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 69.2 percent, and average daily rates increased by 2.7 percent to $326.63. The $6 million increase in segment results, compared to 2007, reflected a $7 million increase in base management and incentive management fees and $18 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $8 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses, an $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, $1 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008, (see Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for additional information), and a $1 million decrease in gains and other income. The increase in fees over the year ago period reflected new properties added to the system, partially offset by the receipt in 2007 of $5 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years. 50 Table of Contents The $18 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected charges of $8 million in 2007 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified to held and used, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale, compared to $6 million of depreciation charges for that same property in 2008, as well as expenses totaling $3 million in 2007 associated with opening a new leased property, $10 million of improved results in 2008 associated with two properties, one of which was being renovated in 2007, and $2 million of increased branding fees in 2008. The $8 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected costs associated with unit growth and development as well as bad debt expense related to accounts receivable deemed uncollectible (see the Other Charges caption in Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information). The $8 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see the Other Charges caption in Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information). Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2008, compared to $1,307 million in 2007. 51 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club and Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands.

Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $411 million (38 percent), compared to 2008, to $665 million from $1,076 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2009, compared to 2008, reflected a $396 million decrease in timeshare contract sales and a $22 million decrease in fractional contract sales, partially offset by $7 million of lower residential net cancellation allowances on contract sales. Sales of fractional and timeshare intervals decreased significantly as a result of weak demand, but were partially offset by a decrease in cancellation allowances of $32 million, as compared with prior year, recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain residential and fractional projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for additional information). The $311 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,439 million from $1,750 million primarily reflected a $300 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $16 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, partially offset by a $5 million increase in base management fees. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to the 2008 fiscal year and higher financing revenue. Timeshare segment revenues in 2009 and 2008 included $46 million and $68 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $37 million and $16 million, respectively. Segment losses of $679 million in 2009 increased by $707 million from $28 million of segment income in 2008, and reflected $685 million of impairments ($614 million of which we reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption and $71 million of which we reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Timeshare strategy impairment charges section for more information on the impairments), $17 million of higher restructuring costs, $23 million in lower joint venture equity earnings, a $14 million 52 Table of Contents decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, and $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $31 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $5 million of higher base management fees. The $6 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe as noted in the 2008 Compared to 2007 discussion that follows. The $43 million increase in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected: (1) a $21 million increase in note sale gains, from $16 million in 2008, which included a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness, to $37 million in 2009, due to only one note sale in 2008 as compared with two note sales in 2009; (2) $22 million of increased residual interest accretion reflecting incremental accretion from the second quarter 2008, first quarter 2009, and fourth quarter 2009 note sales; (3) a $12 million decrease in the charge that reduced the valuation of residual interests to $20 million in 2009 from $32 million in 2008; and (4) a $13 million decrease in the cost of financing due to cost containment efforts. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $22 million of lower interest income because of lower notes receivable balances in 2009 due to the completion of the 2009 second and fourth quarter note sales; and $5 million of lower settlement revenue, net of expenses, due to lower settlement volume. The $20 million recorded charge for the reduced value of residual interests in 2009 consisted of a $19 million unfavorable impact for eight previously securitized pools that reached performance triggers as a result of increased defaults in 2009, partially offset by a $4 million benefit for the release of seven of the eight performance triggers later in 2009 due to improved loan performance, and a $5 million net unfavorable impact from changes in the assumptions for discount, default and prepayment rates that we used in our estimate of fair market value (see the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for more information). The $17 million decrease in services revenue net of expenses was driven by lower rental revenue due to the weak demand and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. The $15 million increase in other revenue, net of expenses, was primarily a result of higher marketing and sales revenue. The $17 million increase in restructuring costs reflected a $24 million increase in facilities exit costs and $1 million increase in severance costs, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in development cancellations (see the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for additional information). The $31 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $33 million in cost savings primarily generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions and other cost reductions and a $4 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008, partially offset by a $7 million 2009 write off of capitalized software development costs related to a project for which we have decided not to pursue further development. See the Other Charges caption in the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section for additional information on the write off of capitalized software costs. Joint venture equity earnings decreased by $23 million and primarily reflected decreased earnings from a joint venture, attributable to weak 2009 demand for a residential and fractional project. The $14 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to a $12 million noncontrolling interest benefit recorded in 2008 related to an impairment of a joint venture we consolidate. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $269 million in 2009, compared to $285 million in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $325 million (23 percent) compared to 2007 to $1,076 million from $1,401 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2008, compared to the prior year, reflected a $173 million decrease in timeshare sales, an $83 million decrease in residential sales, and a $69 million decrease in fractional sales. The decrease in timeshare contract sales reflected the impact of projects approaching sellout and significantly lower demand. Sales of residential and fractional units were significantly impacted by weak demand, as well 53 Table of Contents as increased cancellation allowances of $115 million recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded under the percentage of completion method for certain projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for additional information). The $315 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,750 million from $2,065 million reflected a $324 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, and a $1 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $10 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to the prior year, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2008, a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008, a $32 million impact from the reduced valuation of residual interests, contract cancellation allowances of $17 million, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, as well as the recognition, in 2007, of revenues received in prior years for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, revenue that became reportable subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year, and increased services revenue. Timeshare segment revenues for 2008 and 2007 included $68 million and $50 million, respectively, of interest income and note sale gains of $16 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Segment results of $28 million in 2008 decreased by $278 million from $306 million in 2007, and reflected $261 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $28 million of restructuring costs, and $13 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $24 million of higher net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and $1 million in higher joint venture equity earnings. The $261 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, $95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses, $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses, partially offset by $4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses, and $2 million of lower joint venture related expenses. Lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval, fractional, and residential projects, increased marketing and sales costs, lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, start up costs in 2008 for newer projects, low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds, revenue recognition for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, a $9 million impact from inventory write downs related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe, and a $5 million net impact from contract cancellation allowances (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for additional information). In addition, development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected an impairment charge. We recorded a pretax charge of $22 million ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) in the 2008 third quarter within the Timeshare direct caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate. We made the adjustment in accordance with the guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at year end 2008. The predominant items we considered in our analysis were the downturn in market conditions including contract cancellations, and tightening in the credit markets, especially for jumbo mortgage loans. We estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash flow model that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10 year risk free interest rate determined from the yield curve for U.S. Treasury instruments (3.68 percent). The $25 million noncontrolling interests benefit reflected our joint venture partners portion of the losses of subsidiaries that we consolidate. The $25 million noncontrolling interests benefit also reflected the impact of the pretax benefit of $12 million in 2008, representing our joint venture partners pretax share of the $22 million impairment charge. The $95 million decrease in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected $65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007, mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007, $42 million of lower residual interest accretion, and $6 million of increased financing costs, partially offset by $18 million of increased interest income. Lower note sale gains of $65 million reflected a $12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the $42 million of lower residual interest accretion reflected a $32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair market value (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information regarding these charges). In 2008 and 2007, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $300 million and $520 million, respectively. The $34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year. 54 Table of Contents The $28 million of restructuring costs represented $14 million in severance costs, $9 million in development cancellations, and $5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment (see Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred). The $13 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits. Joint venture equity earnings increased $1 million and reflected $10 million of start up losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures, mostly offset by $7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 (see the Other Charges caption of Footnote No. 20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our 2008 Form 10 K for additional information) and $3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with Timeshare segment properties totaled $285 million in 2008, compared to $275 million in 2007. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel The tax credits provided under IRC Section 45K were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through December 31, 2007. Given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phase out of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on November 3, 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, Discontinued Operations Synthetic Fuel, in this report for additional information regarding the Synthetic Fuel segment. 2008 Compared to 2007 The synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of $1 million in 2008 and $352 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment totaled $3 million, net of tax, in 2008, compared to a loss of $1 million in 2007. Income from the Synthetic Fuel segment of $3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the Secretary of the Treasury in 2008 of the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2007, partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits. SHARE BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (Stock Option Program); (2) stock appreciation rights (SARs); (3) restricted stock units of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. During 2009, we granted 0.8 million restricted stock units and 0.5 million Employee SARs, 5,600 Non employee SARs, and 39,000 deferred stock units. See Footnote No. 4, Share Based Compensation, later in this report for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for information on both (1) our adoption of new accounting standards in 2009, none of which had a material impact on our financial statements and (2) our first quarter of 2010 adoption of the following recently issued accounting standards and the estimated initial impact of those adoptions on our financial statements: Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 140, or Accounting Standards Update No. 2009 16, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, and FAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), or Accounting Standards Update No. 2009 17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities. The impact of adopting these recently issued accounting standards could, in subsequent periods, also prevent us from meeting the derecognition criteria of ASC 860, and, accordingly, prevent us from achieving sale accounting for future securitization transactions because the underlying securitization vehicles may require consolidation. We estimate that if we had adopted the aforementioned new accounting standards as of the first day of our 2009 fiscal year, we would have reported an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal year 2009 of approximately $18 million, primarily attributable to the difference between the increased amount of interest income from notes held (net of interest expense to third party debt holders) and the previously recorded accretion income attributed to residual interests for our past securitization transactions. After we adopt these new accounting standards, we will recognize higher amounts of interest income from notes held and interest expense, and we will no longer recognize gains from the sales of our timeshare notes. 55 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels, as well as to develop timeshare properties. Capital markets were disrupted in the fourth quarter of 2008 and have remained challenging due to the worldwide financial crisis. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. We also periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. Our Credit Facility, which expires on May 14, 2012, and associated letters of credit, provide for $2.4 billion of aggregate effective borrowings and has supported our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread based on the credit ratings for our public debt. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information on our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to our Current Report on Form 8 K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits the Companys maximum leverage (consisting of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we need to do so in the future. We believe the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. At year end 2009, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.978 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $1.863 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $115 million. Borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility of $1.863 billion was calculated as $2.404 billion of allowable effective aggregate borrowings under our Credit Facility, less letters of credit outstanding totaling $116 million, and less Credit Facility borrowings outstanding of $425 million. As noted in the previous paragraphs, we anticipate that this available capacity will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs and because we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facilitys covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions become considerably worse than we currently anticipate. Until the 2008 fourth quarter, when disruptions in the financial markets significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market, we regularly issued short term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. At that time we suspended issuing commercial paper and used funds borrowed under the Credit Facility to repay all of our previously issued commercial paper as it matured. Our Standard and Poors commercial paper rating at the end of 2009 was A3. Because the current market for A3 commercial paper is very limited, it would be very difficult to rely on the use of this market as a meaningful source of liquidity, and we do not anticipate issuing commercial paper under these conditions. When we had commercial paper outstanding, we classified it as long term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. We reserved unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market was not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings matured, as was the case in the 2008 fourth quarter. Given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, the limitations on our ability to access the commercial paper market and fluctuations in the costs of issuing commercial paper have not affected our liquidity, and we do not expect they will do so in the future. In 2009, the three major credit rating agencies reduced our long term debt ratings to their lowest investment grade level. Although the agencies published outlooks indicate that they do not currently plan to reduce our debt ratings to below investment grade, we cannot assure you that our ratings will remain at their current levels. Any further downgrades of our long term debt ratings by Standard & Poors, Moodys Investor Service, Fitch Ratings, or other similar rating agencies could increase our cost of capital, limit our access to the capital markets, or permit access only on terms that are more restrictive than those of our current outstanding debt. 56 Table of Contents On September 15, 2009, we made a $79 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our then outstanding Series C Senior Notes. We do not have any further public debt maturities until June 15, 2012. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash from operations $ 868 $ 641 $ 778 Depreciation expense 151 155 162 Amortization expense 34 35 35 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.2 to 1.0 at year end 2009 and 1.3 to 1.0 at year end 2008. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10 K, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 3.1x 4.3x 5.3x 4.6x In response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products, we have correspondingly reduced our projected investment in new development. See Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation section for additional information. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales that we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or when the notes are sold for cash. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Timeshare segment development in excess of cost of sales $ (4 ) $ (299 ) $ (55 ) New Timeshare segment mortgages, net of collections (147 ) (525 ) (559 ) Note repurchases (81 ) (56 ) (30 ) Financially reportable sales less than (in excess of) closed sales 29 126 (16 ) Note sale gains (37 ) (16 ) (81 ) Note sale proceeds 349 237 515 Collection on retained interests in notes sold and servicing fees 82 102 106 Other cash (outflows) inflows (45 ) 33 (35 ) Net cash inflows (outflows) from Timeshare segment activity $ 146 $ (398 ) $ (155 ) Additionally, as discussed in more detail in the Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation caption in Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges eight previously securitized note pools reached performance triggers in 2009 as a result of increased defaults. As of year end 2009, loan performance had improved sufficiently in all but one of these pools to cure the performance triggers. As compared to full year 2008, our cash inflows were reduced by approximately $17 million in 2009 as a result of the performance triggers. On March 9, 2009, we completed a private placement of approximately $205 million of floating rate Timeshare Loan Backed Notes with a bank administered commercial paper conduit. We contributed approximately $284 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products to a newly formed special purpose entity (the 2009 1 Trust). On the same day, the 2009 1 Trust issued approximately $205 million of the 2009 1 Trusts notes. In connection with the private placement of notes receivable, we received proceeds of approximately $181 million, net of costs, and retained $94 million of residual interests in the special purpose entity, which included $81 million of notes we effectively owned after the transfer and $13 million related to the servicing assets and interest only strip. We measured all residual interests at fair market value on the date of the transfer. The notes effectively owned after the transfer require accounting treatment as notes receivable and are carried at the basis established at the date of transfer unless we deem them non recoverable in the future, in which case we would record a valuation allowance. In connection with this March 2009 note sale, we recorded a $1 million loss, which was included within the Timeshare sales and services line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 57 Table of Contents On October 21, 2009, we sold a pool of approximately $380 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity (the 2009 2 Trust). Simultaneous with the sale, investors purchased $317 million of 4.809 percent Timeshare Loan Backed Notes from the 2009 2 Trust in a private placement. As part of this transaction, we paid off the notes that the 2009 1 Trust issued in March 2009 and reacquired approximately $233 million of timeshare mortgage loans that were released from the 2009 1 Trust. We included approximately $218 million of these reacquired loans in the October 21, 2009 sale. As consideration for our sale of the timeshare mortgage loans, we received cash proceeds of approximately $168 million and a subordinated residual interest in the 2009 2 Trust, through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time. These cash proceeds are net of approximately $145 million paid to the commercial paper conduit to unwind the first quarter transaction. In connection with this October 2009 note sale, we recorded a $38 million gain, which was included within the Timeshare sales and services line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2008 and much of 2009, less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets significantly reduced our gain from Timeshare segment note sales, as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and lower overall amounts in proportion to the amounts of mortgage notes purchased. As a result, in the second quarter 2008 and for both transactions in 2009, we retained larger residual interests in the applicable trusts than we had in prior transactions. In the first quarter 2009 note sale, the bank administered conduit that purchased our AAA rated mortgage notes provided $205 million in funding, with the floating interest rate swapped into an effective fixed interest rate of 9.87 percent. This compares with effective interest rates (after taking into account the impact of the corresponding swaps) for the AAA rated notes issued by the trusts of 7.19 percent for the 2008 second quarter notes sale; 5.91 percent for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale; and 5.54 percent for the 2007 second quarter note sale. By the fourth quarter of 2009, the market improved and we issued $380 million of AAA rated mortgage notes (included both new mortgage notes of $162 million and mortgage notes from the conduit transaction in the first quarter of 2009 of $218 million) at an effective fixed interest rate of 4.81 percent. In addition, while the trusts in two 2007 securitizations each also issued 15.5 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at ratings of less than AAA, we concluded that the market for lower rated notes during 2008 and 2009 was insufficient to permit issuance of AA, A, and BBB+ rated notes at attractive spreads. Accordingly, we decided to retain larger residual interests, or principal only strips, in the trusts associated with each transaction. We had residual interests of $214 million and $221 million, respectively, at year end 2009 and year end 2008, which we recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long term receivables of $144 million and $134 million, respectively, and other current assets of $70 million and $87 million, respectively. Our servicing assets and residual interests, which we measured using Level 3 inputs (which are described in Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements) in the fair value measurement hierarchy, accounted for 91 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year end 2009 that are required to be measured at fair value using the fair value measurement guidance. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded trading gains of $18 million and losses of $9 million, respectively, and in 2007, we recorded trading gains of $30 million. For additional information on how we estimate the fair value of our residual interests and our assumptions used, including a stress test of those assumptions, please see Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements. For additional information on our timeshare note sales, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, our maximum exposure to loss on those securitized notes, and contractual servicing fees that we earned, see Footnote No. 13, Asset Securitizations. See also Future Adoption of Accounting Standards and Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for discussions of the expected impact of our future adoption of amendments to the accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and to reporting on a consolidated basis on existing and future asset securitizations. We estimate that, for the 20 year period from 2010 through 2029, the cost of completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately $2.9 billion. This estimate is based on our current development plans, which remain subject to change. Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $147 million in 2009, $357 million in 2008, and $671 million in 2007 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which are included in Cash from Operations, as noted in that section, are not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures decreased primarily due to reduced development spending, a result of our cost containment efforts, as well as expenditures related to improvements to existing properties that were completed in the prior year . We expect that near term 58 Table of Contents capital expenditures will be consistent with 2009 levels. See the discussion of Development and Financing Risks within the Risk Factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because: (1) we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million in 2009, $38 million in 2008, and $745 million in 2007. Loan Activity. We have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel. Based on historical experience, over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. Loan collections and sales, net of advances during 2009 and 2008, amounted to net loan advances of $45 million and $17 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Senior loans outstanding totaled $1 million (which included a current portion of $1 million) at year end 2009 and $2 million, all of which was long term, at year end 2008. Mezzanine and other loans totaled $195 million (which included a current portion of $95 million) at year end 2009 and $236 million (which included a current portion of $15 million) at year end 2008. In 2009, our notes receivable balance associated with senior, mezzanine, and other loans, decreased by $42 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $28 million in 2009, $25 million in 2008, and $40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt decreased by $797 million in 2009, to $2,298 million at year end 2009 from $3,095 million, and reflected a $544 million decrease in borrowings under our Credit Facility, the repayment, upon maturity, of $79 million (including interest) of Series C Senior Notes in 2009, the repurchase of $119 million in book value ($122 million in principal amount) of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $57 million. Debt increased by $130 million in 2008, to $3,095 million at year end 2008 from $2,965 million at year end 2007, and reflected $969 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of $585 million, the repayment, upon maturity, of $91 million of Series E Senior Notes in the 2008 first quarter, repurchase of $109 million of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $54 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2009, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 4.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.7 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year end 2009. At the end of 2009, we had long term public debt ratings of BBB from Standard and Poors and Baa3 from Moodys. See the Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities, caption within this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on our Credit Facility. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million. In 2008, we repurchased $109 million of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $28 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $77 million and its carrying amount of $105 million of the debt. Share Repurchases. We did not purchase any shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2009. We purchased 11.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share and 41.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2007 at an average price of $43.32 per share. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year end 2009, 21.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. We do not currently anticipate share repurchase activity in 2010. 59 Table of Contents Dividends. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on February 4, 2010, and stock dividends on May 1, August 6, and November 5, 2009, respectively. As a result, for periods prior to the stock dividends, we have retroactively adjusted, as of the dates of record, all share and per share data in this report. See Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on these stock dividends. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year end 2009: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 2,913 $ 162 $ 985 $ 559 $ 1,207 Capital lease obligations (1) 10 1 2 2 5 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,305 144 260 214 687 Non recourse 382 16 31 28 307 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 92 27 41 20 4 Purchase obligations 124 120 2 2 Other long term liabilities 140 26 11 103 Total contractual obligations $ 4,966 $ 470 $ 1,347 $ 836 $ 2,313 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year end 2009 of $249 million. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. We anticipate concluding U.S. federal appeals negotiations for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years in the next 12 months, where the items under consideration include the taxation of our loyalty and gift card programs and the treatment of funds received from foreign subsidiaries. The conclusion of the negotiations could have a material impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balances. See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, for additional information. The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year end 2009: Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 279 $ 85 $ 52 $ 89 $ 53 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 233 43 88 72 30 Total guarantee commitments $ 512 $ 128 $ 140 $ 161 $ 83 In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Our liability related to this guarantee is included in our liability for anticipated project funding disclosed in Footnote No. 20, Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges. We have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of CAD $466 million (USD $441 million). We do not expect to fund under this project completion guarantee. For additional information on these project completion guarantees, including our pro rata ownership percentages, see the Guarantees caption within Footnote No. 18, Contingencies. For additional information on our guarantees, including their nature and the circumstances under which they were entered into, see the Guarantees caption within Footnote No. 18, Contingencies. In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. 60 Table of Contents We also had the following other commitments, including loan and investment commitments, outstanding at year end 2009: Loan and Investment Commitments Amount of Loan and Investment Commitments Expected Funding By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total loan commitments $ 4 $ 1 $ 2 $ $ 1 Total investment commitments 49 1 38 10 Total other commitments $ 53 $ 1 $ 3 $ 38 $ 11 For further information on our loan and investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the Loan and Investment Commitments caption within Footnote No. 18, Contingencies. At year end 2009, we also had $116 million of letters of credit outstanding, the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year end 2009 totaled $361 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 49 percent. For other information regarding these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 24, Related Party Transactions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Please see Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on: Marriott Rewards, our frequent guest loyalty program, including how members earn points, how we determine the fair value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue related to Marriott Rewards; Valuation of Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill; Valuation of Intangibles and Long Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long lived assets; Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures; 61 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies; Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; Loan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans and for Loans to Timeshare Owners, including information on how we measure impairment on each of these types of loans. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and debt and equity prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable, our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of Timeshare segment notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact our floating rate long term debt and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt and equity prices from our investments in debt securities. We account for our investment as available for sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year end 2009, our investment had a fair value of $18 million. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in foreign operations hedges, fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
