Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,545 properties (618,104 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year end 2010 and include 34 home and condominium products (3,391 units) for which we manage the related owners associations. In addition, we provided 2,043 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 70 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. During 2010 we broadened our timeshare interval product offering to include the sale of the points based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program in North America and the Caribbean. The Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program offers greater flexibility, further personalization and more experience opportunities for participating timeshare owners. See the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program caption later in this Form 10 K for additional information. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand alone basis under The Ritz Carlton brand (The Ritz Carlton Residences) and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (The Ritz Carlton Destination Club and Grand Residences by Marriott Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Lodging Business conditions for our lodging business improved in 2010. While the recent recession significantly impacted lodging demand and hotel pricing, occupancies began to improve late in 2009 and that improvement continued throughout 2010. Room rates began to stabilize and improve in some markets in the 2010 second quarter, and that improvement continued, strengthened and expanded to other markets throughout the rest of 2010. In 2010, worldwide average daily rates on a constant dollar basis stayed the same as 2009 for company operated properties. Worldwide RevPAR for company operated properties increased 6.3 percent on a constant dollar basis for 2010, as compared to 2009, and occupancy increased 4.1 percentage points to 68.7 percent. While worldwide RevPAR for 2010 remained well below 2008 levels, we continued to see strengthening in properties in Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, and in our luxury properties around the world. Our hotels in Asia are particularly benefitting from strong economic growth in that region. Additionally, hotels in North America experienced stronger demand from corporate transient and association group customers in 2010 as compared to 2009, and that demand continued to strengthen progressively during the 2010 period. However, property level banquet and catering spending continues to be weak primarily reflecting tight budgets and fewer group functions; although we did experience some improvement late in 2010. During the 2010 first quarter, group meeting cancellations declined to typical levels, and expected revenue from group meetings continued to improve throughout 2010. While our booking windows for both group business and transient business remain very short, our pace of bookings for group business for future periods continued to improve throughout 2010. We monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels. We modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates at many hotels. Negotiated corporate business (special corporate business) represented 14 percent of our full service hotel room nights for 2010 in North America. By late 2010, demand trends had further strengthened, and we had negotiated rates with more 25 Table of Contents than two thirds of our 2011 special corporate rate clients. Those rates were meaningfully higher than those we negotiated in 2009 and early 2010. We typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply, which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly. We expect to complete negotiations with our remaining special corporate business clients in the 2011 first quarter. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non room spend, and aggregate spend. Group business pricing is also inflexible in the near term, as some group business may be booked several years in advance of guest arrival. However, as a result of the recent recession, shorter group booking windows became more common for 2010 than they were in prior years. Accordingly, with strengthening demand, group business booked in 2010 showed stronger price improvement than business booked in 2009, and in the year for the year bookings also increased in 2010. Properties in our system are maintaining very tight cost controls, as we continue to focus on enhancing property level house profit margins. Where appropriate for market conditions, we have maintained many of our 2009 property level cost saving initiatives such as adjusting menus and restaurant hours, modifying room amenities, cross training personnel, utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible, and not filling some vacant positions. We also reduced above property costs, which are allocated to hotels, by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we have not filled certain above property vacant positions, and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year end 2010, we operated 45 percent of the hotel rooms in our system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements, and we owned or leased 2 percent. Our emphasis on long term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth. This strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make. We consider RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Company operated house profit margin is the ratio of property level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. For our North American comparable properties, systemwide RevPAR (which includes data from our franchised, managed, owned, and leased properties) increased by 4.9 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting improved occupancy levels in most markets, partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates. For our properties outside North America, systemwide RevPAR for 2010 increased 9.2 percent versus 2009, reflecting improved occupancy levels, partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates. Timeshare We launched the points based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (MVCD Program) in North America and the Caribbean in June 2010, and we are initially focusing our marketing efforts on existing customers. As a result, in 2010, contract sales to existing owners increased 31 percent while sales to new customers declined. We expect accelerated sales to new customers in 2011. See the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program caption later in this Form 10 K for additional information. Contract sales for our timeshare, fractional, and residential products increased modestly in 2010, compared to 2009, largely due to a decline in contract sales cancellation allowances. We adjust our contract sales for cancellation allowances that we record in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to pre closing contract cancellations. At the same time, contract sales were constrained by difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. By the end of 2010, timeshare pricing improved because we had largely discontinued or reduced the purchase incentives and targeted marketing efforts instituted in 2009. 26 Table of Contents Rental revenues increased in 2010 with stronger leisure demand for our Marriott Vacation Club product and greater available rental inventory. Demand for fractional and residential units remains weak. Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of contract sales continue to improve. As with Lodging, our Timeshare properties continue to maintain very tight cost controls, and we have not filled certain vacant positions, and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage of completion accounting method, current demand may not always be reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. On January 2, 2010, the first day of our 2010 fiscal year, we adopted the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. As a result of adopting these standards in the 2010 first quarter, we consolidated 13 existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions, and we recorded a one time non cash after tax reduction to shareholders equity of $146 million ($238 million pretax) in the 2010 first quarter, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more detailed information on our adoption of these new accounting topics, including the impact to our Balance Sheet and Statement of Income. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2010, 2009, and 2008. Continuing Operations Revenues 2010 Compared to 2009 Revenues increased by $783 million (7 percent) to $11,691 million in 2010 from $10,908 million in 2009, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($557 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($98 million); base management and franchise fees ($73 million); incentive management fees ($28 million (comprised of a $12 million increase for North America and a $16 million increase outside of North America)); and owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($27 million). The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,221 million in 2010, from $1,123 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default), and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the MVCD Program. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The increases in base management fees, to $562 million in 2010 from $530 million in 2009, and in franchise fees, to $441 million in 2010 from $400 million in 2009, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system. The increase in incentive management fees, to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,046 million in 2010, from $1,019 million in 2009, largely reflected $14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system, $8 million of higher branding fees, $6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties, and $5 million of higher other revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a one time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. The increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased RevPAR and occupancy levels. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $78 million and $70 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income attributable to us. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,239 million in 2010 from $7,682 million in 2009, reflected the impact of growth across the system, partially offset by lower property level 27 Table of Contents costs in response to cost controls. Net of hotels exiting the system, we added 4,287 managed rooms and 17,024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008 Revenues decreased by $1,971 million (15 percent) to $10,908 million in 2009 from $12,879 million in 2008, as a result of lower: cost reimbursements revenue ($1,152 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($300 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($206 million); incentive management fees ($157 million (comprised of $108 million for North America and $49 million outside of North America)); base management fees ($105 million (comprised of $79 million for North America and $26 million outside of North America)); and franchise fees ($51 million). The decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,682 million in 2009 from $8,834 million in 2008, reflected lower property level costs, in response to lower occupancy and cost controls, partially offset by the impact of growth across the system. We added 35 managed properties (8,574 rooms) and 200 franchised properties (25,136 rooms) to our system in 2009, net of properties exiting the system. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue of $300 million (21 percent), to $1,123 million in 2009, from $1,423 million in 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to 2008 and higher financing revenue. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,019 million in 2009, from $1,225 million in 2008, largely reflected $183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $70 million and $64 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected RevPAR declines associated with weak lodging demand. The decrease in incentive management fees, to $154 million in 2009 from $311 million in 2008, reflected lower property level revenue, associated with weak demand, lower RevPAR, and the associated lower property level operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotels owner. With particularly weak demand and low property level operating income in 2009, most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee. In 2009, only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us, as compared to 56 percent in 2008. The decreases in base management fees, to $530 million in 2009 from $635 million in 2008, and franchise fees, to $400 million in 2009 from $451 million in 2008, both reflected RevPAR declines driven by weaker demand, partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system. Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges In 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Income Statement ($502 million after tax), including $614 million of pretax charges that impacted operating income under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption, and $138 million of pretax charges that impacted non operating income under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments. See Footnote No. 18, Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information, including a table showing the composition of the charges. Restructuring Costs and Other Charges As a result of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008, we incurred $55 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2008. As part of these actions we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our Timeshare segment, hotel development, above property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. For additional information on the 2008 and 2009 restructuring costs, including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment, please see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K. For the cumulative restructuring costs incurred since inception and a roll forward of the restructuring liability through year end 28 Table of Contents 2010, please see Footnote No. 19, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to our Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. As a result of our restructuring efforts, we realized the following annual cost savings in 2010, which were primarily reflected in our Income Statement under the expense captions noted: (i) $113 million ($73 million after tax) for our Timeshare segment, under Timeshare direct and General, administrative, and other; (ii) $12 million ($8 million after tax) for hotel development across several of our Lodging segments, primarily under General, administrative, and other; and (iii) $10 million ($8 million after tax) for reducing above property level lodging management personnel under General, administrative, and other. Operating Income (Loss) 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating income increased by $847 million to operating income of $695 million in 2010 from an operating loss of $152 million in 2009. The increase in operating income reflected a favorable variance of $614 million related to Timeshare strategy impairment charges recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $51 million decrease in restructuring costs, $28 million of higher incentive management fees, and $23 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $58 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. We note the reasons for the increase of $73 million in base management and franchise fees as well as the increase of $28 million in incentive management fees as compared to 2009 in the preceding Revenues section. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2010 totaled $199 million. The increase of $116 million as compared to 2009, primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, which largely reflected increased interest income associated with the impact of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitized notes under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower product costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated in the preceding Revenues section. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $23 million (34 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $12 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of property closing costs, $8 million of higher branding fees, a $4 million reversal of a liability related to a hotel that closed in 2010, and net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property level margins, partially offset by additional rent expense associated with one property and an unfavorable variance from a one time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $58 million (8 percent) to $780 million in 2010 from $722 million in 2009. The increase primarily reflected the following 2010 charges: an $84 million long lived asset impairment associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a $13 million long lived asset impairment (allocated to our Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long lived asset impairment (allocated to our North American Limited Service segment). See Footnote No. 8, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding these three impairment charges. In addition, we recorded a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge (allocated to our North American Full Service segment) in 2010. See the North American Full Service segment discussion for additional information regarding this impairment charge. Also contributing to the year over year increase was $35 million of higher incentive compensation costs, $14 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with initiatives to enhance our brands globally, $7 million of increased currency exchange losses, and $2 million of increased legal expenses. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by an $8 million reversal in 2010 of guarantee accruals, primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements, and a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States. In addition, the comparison reflects the following 2009 expenses that we did not incur in 2010: $49 million of impairment charges related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by an $11 million reversal of the 2008 accrual for the funding of those cash flow shortfalls; a $7 million write off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. The year over year comparison also reflected a $15 million favorable variance in deferred compensation expenses (with changes to our deferred compensation plan, general, administrative, and other expenses for 2010 had no deferred 29 Table of Contents compensation impact, compared with $15 million of mark to market valuation expenses in 2009). The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was also partially offset by the elimination of the loan loss provision in 2010, compared with a $43 million provision in 2009, which reflected $29 million associated with one Luxury segment project and $14 million associated with a North American Limited Service segment portfolio. The $58 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses was comprised of: a $77 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $5 million increase impacting our Timeshare segment; an $8 million decrease impacting our North American Limited Service segment; an $8 million decrease impacting our Luxury segment; a $7 million decrease impacting our North American Full Service segment; and a $1 million decrease impacting our International segment. 2009 Compared to 2008 Operating income decreased by $917 million (120 percent) to an operating loss of $152 million in 2009 from operating income of $765 million in 2008. The decrease in operating income reflected Timeshare strategy impairment charges in 2009 of $614 million, $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees, $69 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs of $4 million. In the preceding Revenues section, we note the reasons for the decrease of $157 million in incentive management fees as well as the decrease of $156 million in combined base management and franchise fees as compared to 2008. Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2009 totaled $83 million. The decline of $6 million (7 percent) from $89 million in 2008 primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe. Higher financing revenue net of financing expenses reflected higher note securitization gains, increased residual interest accretion, a decrease in the adjustment to the fair market value of residual interests, and a decrease in the cost of financing, partially offset by lower interest income. Lower services revenue net of expenses reflected weak demand for rentals and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare later in this section for additional information regarding our Timeshare segment. The $69 million (50 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to a decline of $65 million in revenue, net of expenses primarily associated with weaker demand at owned and leased properties, as well as our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $81 million (10 percent) to $722 million in 2009 from $803 million in 2008. The decrease primarily reflected $186 million of lower expenses, largely due to cost savings generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008 and lower incentive compensation as well as a $12 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008. Additionally, in 2009 we reached final settlement regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment and recorded a $3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the General, administrative, and other expense caption on our Income Statement. For additional information regarding the Delta Airlines lease investment, see the Investment in Leveraged Lease caption in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2008 Form 10 K. These benefits were partially offset by the following items: $49 million of impairment charges for two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls; 2009 provisions for loan losses of $43 million for two loans partially offset by a $22 million favorable variance from a 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan; an $8 million impairment charge related to the write off of contract acquisition costs for one property; a $7 million write off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; $12 million of expenses primarily related to write offs of other assets that we deemed non recoverable, performance cure accruals, and guarantee accruals associated with 12 hotels; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. Additionally, 2009 included a $15 million unfavorable impact 30 Table of Contents associated with deferred compensation expenses, compared to a $28 million favorable impact in 2008, both of which reflected mark to market valuations. Of the $81 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses, a $1 million increase was attributable to our Lodging segments, a $31 million decrease was attributable to our Timeshare segment, and a $51 million decrease was unallocated. Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense) The table below shows our gains (losses) and other income for 2010, 2009, and 2008: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gain on debt extinguishment $ 0 $ 21 $ 28 Gains on sales of real estate and other 34 10 14 Gain/(loss) on sale of joint venture and other investments 1 3 (1 ) Income/(loss) from cost method joint ventures 0 2 (3 ) Impairment of equity securities 0 (5 ) 0 $ 35 $ 31 $ 38 2010 Compared to 2009 We did not extinguish any debt in 2010. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. The $21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the $98 million purchase price and the $119 million net carrying amount of Senior Notes we repurchased during the period. The $5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K. 2009 Compared to 2008 See the previous paragraph for information on our debt extinguishment and impairment of equity securities in 2009. We did not extinguish any debt in 2008. Interest Expense 2010 Compared to 2009 Interest expense increased by $62 million (53 percent) to $180 million in 2010 compared to $118 million in 2009. This increase was driven by: (1) the consolidation of $1,121 million of debt in the 2010 first quarter associated with previously securitized notes, which resulted in a $55 million increase in interest expense in 2010 related to that debt; (2) a $14 million unfavorable variance from 2009 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2010 associated with construction projects; and (3) $12 million of higher interest expense in 2010 associated with our executive deferred compensation plan. These increases were partially offset by: (1) $12 million of lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of $122 million of principal amount of our Senior Notes in 2009, the maturity of our Series C Senior Notes in the 2009 fourth quarter and other net debt reductions; and (2) a $7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our $2.4 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (our Credit Facility), which primarily reflected lower average borrowings. 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest expense decreased by $45 million (28 percent) to $118 million in 2009 compared to $163 million in 2008. Interest expense associated with commercial paper and our Credit Facility decreased by $25 million reflecting the repayment of our commercial paper in 2008 and increased borrowings under the Credit Facility with a lower interest rate. We also benefited from a $26 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners (including our Marriott Rewards, gift certificates, and self insurance programs) as a result of lower interest rates, and the repurchase of some of our Senior Notes across multiple series in the 2008 fourth quarter and 2009 first quarter (see Liquidity and Capital Resources in our 2009 Form 10 K for additional information), which resulted in a $12 million reduction to interest expense, and finally, other interest expense decreases of $5 million. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a $23 million unfavorable variance to 2008 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2009 associated with construction projects. Interest Income and Income Tax 2010 Compared to 2009 Interest income decreased by $6 million (24 percent) to $19 million in 2010, from $25 million in 2009, primarily reflecting a $4 million decrease associated with a loan that we determined was impaired in 2009. Because we recognize 31 Table of Contents interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on this loan after its impairment. The decline in interest income also reflected a $2 million decrease due to a reduction in principal due associated with one loan. Our income tax expense increased by $158 million (243 percent) to a provision of $93 million in 2010 from a benefit of $65 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to pretax income in 2010 (as compared to a pretax loss in 2009) and $14 million of higher tax expense associated with changes to our deferred compensation plan (there were no 2010 plan changes impacting deferred compensation expenses, compared with changes which had a $14 million favorable impact in 2009). The increase was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2010, as 2009 reflected $52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on our treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries. In conjunction with that settlement, we recorded an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010. Our 2010 income tax expense also reflected a $12 million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to prior years estimated foreign tax expense. 2009 Compared to 2008 Interest income decreased by $14 million (36 percent) to $25 million in 2009, from $39 million in 2008, primarily reflecting $8 million of interest income we recorded in 2008 for three loans that subsequently became impaired. Because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on these impaired loans in 2009. The decline in interest income also reflected $5 million of lower interest income due to a decline in interest rates on our cash balances, $2 million of previously reserved interest income collected in 2008, and $2 million of lower interest income in 2009 reflecting a reduction in principal due associated with one loan, partially offset by $4 million of additional interest income from new loans funded at year end 2008 and in 2009. Our tax provision decreased by $415 million (119 percent) to a benefit of $65 million in 2009 from a provision of $350 million in 2008, reflecting a pretax loss in 2009 and $43 million of lower tax expense associated with our deferred compensation plan. The decrease was partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate in 2009 due to a change in our mix of worldwide income resulting from substantial reductions of non U.S. income in jurisdictions with low tax rates. The 2009 tax rate also reflected $52 million of income tax expense, primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries, an issue that was the subject of ongoing discussions at that time between us and the IRS. The charges recorded in 2009 primarily related to our then current exposure related to this issue. In addition to tax expense on pretax earnings, tax expense for 2008 also reflected: (1) $29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction; (2) $19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction; and (3) $24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries. Equity in (Losses) Earnings 2010 Compared to 2009 Equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 decreased by $48 million from equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 and primarily reflected favorable variances from a $30 million impairment charge associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined was fully impaired and a $3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that we did not allocate to one of our segments, both incurred in 2009. In the 2010 fourth quarter we also recorded an $11 million reversal of a funding liability (recorded in 2009) due to progress in that quarter on certain construction related legal claims and other factors. See Footnote No. 18, Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding this reversal. Increased earnings of $5 million for our International segment joint ventures and $3 million of lower cancellation reserves at our Timeshare segment joint venture also contributed to the decrease in equity in losses. A 2010 impairment charge of $5 million associated with our North American Limited Service segment joint venture partially offset the favorable impacts. 2009 Compared to 2008 Equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 increased by $81 million from equity in earnings of $15 million in 2008 and primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired. The decrease in joint venture equity earnings also reflected an unfavorable comparison to $15 million of equity earnings in 2008 from a joint venture that sold portfolio assets and had significant associated gains, and $5 million of earnings in 2008 from another joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture. Further contributing to the decline were $24 million of decreased earnings in 2009 for a Timeshare segment joint venture residential and fractional project, $7 million of equity losses associated with a North American Limited Service segment joint venture, a $3 million impairment and $2 million of other equity losses associated with an International segment joint venture, and $9 million of equity losses at certain other joint ventures, all of which were negatively affected by the weak demand environment. The unfavorable impacts also included a $3 million impairment 32 Table of Contents charge for a joint venture that is not allocated to one of our segments and for which we do not expect to recover our investment. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable $11 million impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate and a 2008 impairment charge of $9 million associated with one Luxury segment joint venture under development. See Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information on some of these joint venture impairments. Net Losses Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 2010 Compared to 2009 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $7 million in 2010 to zero, compared to $7 million in 2009. The benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of $7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners share of losses totaling $11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners share of tax benefits of $4 million associated with the losses. 2009 Compared to 2008 Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $8 million in 2009 to $7 million compared to $15 million in 2008. Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations 2010 Compared to 2009 Income from continuing operations of $458 million in 2010 increased by $811 million (230 percent) from a loss of $353 million in 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to Marriott of $458 million in 2010 increased by $804 million (232 percent) from a loss of $346 million in 2009, and diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott of $1.21 per share increased by $2.18 (225 percent) from losses of $0.97 per share in 2009. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss), the $458 million increase in income from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to a favorable variance related to Timeshare strategy impairment charges in 2009 ($752 million), higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($116 million), lower restructuring costs ($51 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($73 million), lower equity in losses ($48 million), higher incentive management fees ($28 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($23 million), and higher gains and other income ($4 million). These favorable variances were partially offset by higher income taxes ($158 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($58 million), higher interest expense ($62 million), and lower interest income ($6 million). 2009 Compared to 2008 Compared to the prior year, loss from continuing operations increased by $697 million (203 percent) to a 2009 loss of $353 million from 2008 income of $344 million, loss from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $705 million (196 percent) to a 2009 loss of $346 million from 2008 income of $359 million, and diluted losses per share from continuing operations attributable to Marriott increased by $1.94 (200 percent) to $0.97 per share from earnings of $0.97 per share. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss), the $697 million increase in loss from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to 2009 Timeshare strategy impairment charges ($752 million), lower incentive management fees ($157 million), lower base management and franchise fees ($156 million), lower equity in earnings ($81 million), lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($69 million), lower interest income ($14 million), lower gains and other income ($7 million), and lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($6 million). Lower income taxes ($415 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million), lower interest expense ($45 million), and lower restructuring costs ($4 million) partially offset the unfavorable variances. Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA, a financial measure which is not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a companys capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and 33 Table of Contents amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We also evaluate adjusted EBITDA, another non GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance. Our adjusted EBITDA excludes the 2008 and 2009 restructuring costs and other charges totaling $192 million and $213 million, respectively, the 2009 Timeshare strategy impairment charges totaling $752 million, and for 2010, both impairment charges totaling $111 million and the $11 million reversal of a prior year impairment charge. We evaluate adjusted EBITDA that excludes these items to allow for period over period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Both of these non GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting adjusted EBITDAs usefulness as a comparative measure. The table below shows our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations and reconciles those measures with Net Income (Loss) attributable to Marriott.

See Footnote No. 17, Business Segments, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment, and other information about each segment, including revenues, income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Marriott, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, equity in (losses) earnings of equity method investees, assets, and capital expenditures. At year end 2010, we operated or franchised the following properties by segment (excluding 2,043 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non U.S. Total U.S. Non U.S. Total North American Full Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 322 13 335 126,149 4,837 130,986 Marriott Conference Centers 11 0 11 3,298 0 3,298 JW Marriott 19 1 20 10,748 221 10,969 Renaissance Hotels 76 2 78 27,939 790 28,729 Renaissance ClubSport 2 0 2 349 0 349 Autograph Collection 13 0 13 3,828 0 3,828 443 16 459 172,311 5,848 178,159 North American Limited Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard 793 16 809 110,922 2,793 113,715 Fairfield Inn & Suites 648 9 657 58,510 1,029 59,539 SpringHill Suites 273 1 274 31,961 124 32,085 Residence Inn 595 17 612 71,571 2,450 74,021 TownePlace Suites 192 1 193 19,320 105 19,425 2,501 44 2,545 292,284 6,501 298,785 International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 4 155 159 2,767 44,981 47,748 JW Marriott 1 28 29 387 10,631 11,018 Renaissance Hotels 0 66 66 0 21,930 21,930 Courtyard 2 81 83 712 16,642 17,354 Fairfield Inn & Suites 0 1 1 0 206 206 Residence Inn 0 1 1 0 109 109 Marriott Executive Apartments 0 23 23 0 3,775 3,775 7 355 362 3,866 98,274 102,140 Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz Carlton 39 35 74 11,587 10,457 22,044 Bulgari Hotels & Resorts 0 2 2 0 117 117 EDITION 1 0 1 353 0 353 The Ritz Carlton Residential (2) 27 1 28 2,973 112 3,085 The Ritz Carlton Serviced Apartments 0 3 3 0 458 458 67 41 108 14,913 11,144 26,057 Timeshare Segment (3) Marriott Vacation Club 42 11 53 9,800 2,118 11,918 The Ritz Carlton Destination Club 8 2 10 359 132 491 The Ritz Carlton Residences (2) 3 1 4 222 16 238 Grand Residences by Marriott Fractional 1 1 2 199 49 248 Grand Residences by Marriott Residential (1), (2) 2 0 2 68 0 68 56 15 71 10,648 2,315 12,963 Total 3,074 471 3,545 494,022 124,082 618,104 (1) North American includes properties located in the continental United States and Canada.

Residential products are included once they possess a certificate of occupancy. Includes resorts that are in active sales as well as those that are sold out. Products in active sales may not be ready for occupancy. 35 Table of Contents Lodging (reflects all five of our Lodging segments) 2010 Compared to 2009 We added 154 properties (28,114 rooms) and 31 properties (6,072 rooms) exited the system in 2010. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. We also added three residential properties (442 units) and one residential property (25 units) exited the system in 2010. Total segment financial results increased by $979 million to $983 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009, and total segment revenues increased by $780 million to $11,611 million in 2010, a 7 percent increase from revenues of $10,831 million in 2009. The year over year increase in revenues included a $557 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2009, reflected a favorable variance from $685 million of 2009 Timeshare strategy impairment charges, $614 million of which were reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption and $71 million of which were reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption of our Income Statements, an increase of $116 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $19 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,003 million in 2010 from $930 million in 2009, a $48 million decrease in restructuring costs, $35 million of lower joint venture equity losses, $28 million of higher incentive management fees to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, an increase of $21 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $21 million increase in gains and other income. These favorable variances were partially offset by $55 million of increased interest expense and an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest benefit. For more detailed information regarding the variances see the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss). In 2010, 27 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 25 percent in 2009. In addition, in 2010, 65 percent of our incentive fees were derived from properties outside of the continental United States versus 67 percent in 2009. See Statistics below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company operated RevPAR by segment, region and brand. Compared to 2009, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2010 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company operated house profit per available room (HP PAR) increased by 6.4 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of tight cost controls in 2010 at properties in our system and increased demand, partially offset by decreased average daily rates. North American company operated house profit margins were nearly unchanged as compared to 2009 while HP PAR at those same properties increased by 3.8 percent reflecting increased demand and tight cost controls at properties, partially offset by decreased average daily rates and lower cancellation and attrition fees. International company operated house profit margins increased by 120 basis points and HP PAR at those properties increased by 10.6 percent reflecting increased demand and continued tight property level cost controls. 2009 Compared to 2008 We added 254 properties (37,714 rooms) and 17 properties (3,476 rooms) exited the system in 2009. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. We also added five residential properties (568 units) in 2009. Total segment financial results decreased by $1,162 million (100 percent) to $4 million in 2009 from $1,166 million in 2008, and total segment revenues decreased by $1,986 million to $10,831 million in 2009, a 15 percent decrease from total segment revenues of $12,817 million in 2008. As discussed in more detail earlier in this report, demand was weaker in 2009 than 2008. The decrease in revenues included a $1,152 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2008, reflected $685 million of Timeshare impairment charges ($614 million of which were reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption and $71 million of which we reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption of our Income Statements. See the Timeshare strategy impairment charges section for more information on the impairments), $157 million of lower incentive management fees, a $156 million decrease in combined 2009 base management and franchise fees, $85 million of owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $63 million of lower equity joint venture results, $18 million of higher restructuring costs, a $13 million decrease in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interests benefit, a decrease of $9 million in gains and other income, and a decrease 36 Table of Contents of $6 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $30 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses. These decreases included $80 million in other charges (see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K), with $57 million recorded in general, administrative, and other expenses and $23 million recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses. The $156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees reflected lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR in 2009. Incentive management fees decreased by $157 million and reflected lower property level operating revenues and margins associated with weak demand, somewhat offset by property level cost controls. With lower property level operating income, many managed properties did not earn sufficient income to achieve owner priority returns and, as a result, we earned no incentive fees from those properties. In 2009, 67 percent of our incentive fees were derived from hotels outside North America versus 49 percent in 2008. Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2009 decreased by 380 basis points and worldwide comparable company operated HP PAR decreased by 25.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of very tight cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system, more than offset by the impact of year over year RevPAR decreases. International company operated house profit margins declined by 270 basis points, and HP PAR at our International managed properties decreased by 22.0 percent reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. North American company operated house profit margins declined by 440 basis points, and HP PAR at our North American managed properties decreased by 27.7 percent also reflecting significant cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. HP PAR at our North American Limited Service managed properties decreased by 28.7 percent, reflecting cost control plans at properties, more than offset by the impact of decreased demand. Lodging Development We opened 154 properties, totaling 28,114 rooms, across our brands in 2010 and 31 properties (6,072 rooms) left the system, not including residential products or ExecuStay. We also added three residential properties (442 units) and one residential property (25 units) left the system. Highlights of the year included: Converting 23 properties (3,660 rooms), or 13 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to one of our brands including 11 properties joining our Autograph Collection brand. Twenty two of the properties converted were located in the United States; Opening approximately 28 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; Adding 102 properties (12,030 rooms) to our North American Limited Service brands; Opening three new Marriott Vacation Club properties, one in Singer Island, Florida, one in Orlando, Florida, and one in Kauai, Hawaii. We also opened one Ritz Carlton Destination Club property in Vail, Colorado; and Opening our first EDITION hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii (353 rooms). We currently have nearly 105,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 35,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2011. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report. Statistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full Service and North American Limited Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company operated Fairfield Inn & Suites properties in these tables because the brand is predominantly franchised and we operate very few properties, so such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow). 37 Table of Contents Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties. The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics used throughout this report for 2010 include the 52 weeks from January 2, 2010, through December 31, 2010, for 2009 include the 52 weeks from January 3, 2009, through January 1, 2010, and for 2008 include the 53 weeks from December 29, 2007, through January 2, 2009 (except in each case, for The Ritz Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental United States and Canada, which for them includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 38 Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2010 Change vs. 2009 2010 Change vs. 2009 Marriott Hotels & Resorts (2) Occupancy 69.1 % 3.0 % pts. 66.5 % 3.5 % pts.

North American Full Service Lodging includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, and Autograph Collection. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Segment revenues $ 5,108 $ 4,848 $ 5,631 5 % 14 % Segment results $ 318 $ 272 $ 419 17 % 35 % 2010 Compared to 2009 In 2010, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment we added 20 properties (7,591 rooms) and 5 properties (1,541 rooms) left the system. In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American Full Service properties increased by 4.3 percent to $106.95, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.8 percentage points to 68.7 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.1 percent to $155.60. The $46 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, primarily reflected $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $10 million of higher incentive management fees, $7 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $7 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses. The $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and unit growth as well as franchise fees from new properties added to the Autograph Collection. The $10 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins. The $7 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to stronger results driven by higher RevPAR and property level margins. The $7 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected favorable variances from an $8 million impairment charge related to the write off of contract acquisition costs for one property, a $7 million charge for a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009, and a $3 million reversal of a completion guarantee accrual because we satisfied the related guarantee release requirements in 2010. These favorable variances were partially offset by $7 million in net 2010 other cost increases, primarily reflecting incentive compensation, as well as a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge recorded in the 2010 fourth quarter because we expect that a management agreement associated with one property will likely be terminated early in 2011 in conjunction with a change in property ownership. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,575 million in 2010, compared to $4,322 million in 2009. 44 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment, we added 11 properties (3,645 rooms) and 3 properties (800 rooms) left the system. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American Full Service properties decreased by 17.0 percent to $103.87, occupancy decreased by 4.3 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.6 percent to $157.10. The $147 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $71 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, a $15 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $3 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by a $4 million increase in gains and other income. The $71 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property level cost controls. Fifty one properties paid incentive fees in 2009 compared to 101 in 2008. The $60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was primarily driven by lower RevPAR. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, decreased $15 million and primarily reflected $18 million of net losses in 2009 associated with several properties with weak demand, partially offset by a favorable variance of $3 million related to a property that was being renovated, and as a result was not operating at full capacity during 2008. The $4 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with one property that was sold for a loss in the 2008 period. The $3 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected an $8 million impairment charge related to the write off of contract acquisition costs for one property and a $7 million impairment charge related to a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 (see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information), which were mostly offset by $12 million in cost reductions. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service segment properties totaled $4,322 million in 2009, compared to $4,951 million in 2008. North American Limited Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Segment revenues $ 2,149 $ 1,986 $ 2,233 8 % 11 % Segment results $ 298 $ 265 $ 395 12 % 33 % 2010 Compared to 2009 In 2010, across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 102 properties (12,030 rooms) and 15 properties (1,556 rooms) left the system. The majority of the properties that left the system were Residence Inn properties of poor quality. In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American Limited Service properties increased by 3.5 percent to $71.51, occupancy for these properties increased by 3.6 percentage points to 67.1 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 2.0 percent to $106.59. The $33 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, primarily reflected $33 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $8 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $2 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $4 million of increased joint venture equity losses, $4 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower gains and other income. 45 Table of Contents The $33 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR and new unit growth. The $2 million increase in incentive management fees was due to higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins. The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a net $31 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $14 million long lived asset impairment charge in 2010 and $9 million of other cost increases primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. See Footnote No. 8, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010. The $4 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected an impairment charge associated with one joint venture. The $2 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividends from one joint venture due to a decline in available cash flow. The $4 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected lower revenue and property level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,547 million in 2010, compared to $1,419 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 207 properties (24,346 rooms) and 4 properties (588 rooms) left the system. The properties that left the system were mainly franchised hotels associated with our Fairfield Inn & Suites brand. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American Limited Service properties decreased by 20.0 percent to $68.83, occupancy for these properties decreased by 5.8 percentage points to 63.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 12.7 percent to $108.33. The $130 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected $59 million of lower base management and franchise fees, $35 million of lower incentive management fees, $17 million of lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $9 million of lower joint venture equity earnings, $6 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The $59 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was largely due to lower demand and significantly lower RevPAR, partially offset by new unit growth. The $35 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins resulting from weak demand, partially offset by property level cost controls. Twenty three properties paid incentive fees in 2009, compared to 256 in 2008. The $17 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million in lower revenue and property level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties and $6 million of lower property level margins associated with our corporate housing business. The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected equity losses at one of our joint ventures as the related properties experienced weak demand. The $4 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $42 million impairment charge related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, mostly offset by a $15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an $11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls (see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information). The net increase of $16 million associated with the 2008 accrual and 2009 impairment charge was partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily reflecting cost reductions that were part of our cost containment efforts. The $6 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividend distributions in the current year from one joint venture, which had a decline in available cash flow as a result of the weak demand environment. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service segment properties totaled $1,419 million in 2009, compared to $1,541 million in 2008. 46 Table of Contents International Lodging includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments located outside the continental United States and Canada. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Segment revenues $ 1,245 $ 1,145 $ 1,544 9 % 26 % Segment results $ 169 $ 129 $ 246 31 % 48 % 2010 Compared to 2009 In 2010, across our International Lodging segment we added 27 properties (7,600 rooms) and 10 properties (2,626 rooms) left the system, largely due to quality issues. In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties increased by 9.4 percent to $117.38, occupancy for these properties increased by 5.8 percentage points to 70.3 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.3 percent to $166.93. Comparable company operated RevPAR improved significantly in China, Brazil and Germany and, to a lesser extent, in France and the United Kingdom, while the United Arab Emirates experienced RevPAR declines. The $40 million increase in segment results in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily reflected a $13 million increase in incentive management fees, a $9 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $6 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $5 million increase in gains and other income, a $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, and a $2 million decrease in restructuring costs. The $13 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls that favorably impacted house profit margins, and to a lesser extent new unit growth. The $9 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and new unit growth, partially offset by increased currency exchange losses. The $6 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $11 million of stronger results at some owned and leased properties, and $7 million of higher termination fees partially offset by $12 million of additional rent expense associated with one property. The $5 million increase in gains and other income primarily reflected a favorable variance associated with a net gain associated with the sale of two properties in 2010. The $4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased earnings at our joint ventures, resulting from stronger property level performance, and a favorable variance from a $3 million impairment charge recorded for one joint venture in 2009. The $2 million decrease in restructuring costs primarily reflects a favorable variance from a $2 million severance and fringe benefit charge recorded in 2009 during our restructuring efforts. See Footnote No. 19, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International Lodging segment properties totaled $581 million in 2010, compared to $529 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our International Lodging segment, we added 30 properties (8,734 rooms) and 8 properties (1,714 rooms) left the system, largely due to quality issues. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated international properties decreased by 18.0 percent to $108.45, occupancy for these properties decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 66.3 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 11.9 percent to $163.64. RevPAR declined in most markets around the world. The $117 million decrease in segment results in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily reflected a $45 million decrease in incentive management fees, a $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees, an $8 million decrease in gains and other income, a decrease of $9 million in joint venture equity earnings, and $2 million in restructuring costs, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses. 47 Table of Contents The $45 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level margins, driven by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable currency exchange rates compared to 2008, partially offset by property level cost controls. The $25 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was driven mainly by lower RevPAR, impacted by weak demand and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable currency exchange rates, somewhat offset by the impact of new room additions. The $40 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $23 million of weaker results, driven by weak demand and lower RevPAR at some owned and leased properties, $13 million of lower termination fees, and $3 million of lower income reflecting conversions from leased properties to managed properties. The $8 million decrease in gains and other income reflected miscellaneous gain activity in 2008 that did not occur in 2009. Restructuring costs totaling $2 million reflected severance and fringe benefit costs. See Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to our 2009 Form 10 K for more information. The $9 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings was primarily driven by a $3 million impairment charge and $12 million in lower equity results at three joint ventures primarily reflecting lower demand. See Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information on the joint venture impairment. The decrease also reflected an $11 million unfavorable impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate, partially offset by a $5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures in 2008. The $11 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $15 million in cost reductions due to our cost containment efforts, partially offset by $3 million in guarantee reserves for two properties. See Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our International segment properties totaled $529 million in 2009, compared to $707 million in 2008. Luxury Lodging includes The Ritz Carlton, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, and EDITION worldwide. Annual Change ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Segment revenues $ 1,563 $ 1,413 $ 1,659 11 % 15 % Segment results $ 77 $ 17 $ 78 353 % 78 % 2010 Compared to 2009 In 2010, across our Luxury Lodging segment we added 3 properties (763 rooms) and 1 property (349 rooms) left the system becoming an Autograph hotel. In 2010, we also added 3 residential products (441 units) and 1 product (25 units) left the system. Compared to 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased by 10.2 percent to $193.17, occupancy for these properties increased by 5.9 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.4 percent to $292.11. While Luxury Lodging was particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business in 2009, that business improved in 2010. The $60 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, reflected a $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $8 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $7 million increase in base management fees, and a $3 million increase in incentive management fees. The $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $30 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired. The $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $6 million favorable variance from improved operating performance at three properties, as well as $4 million of higher branding fees primarily from one property, and $2 million of termination fees net of property closing costs, all in 2010. The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $5 million reversal in 2010 of a completion guarantee accrual for which we satisfied the related requirements and a $4 million favorable variance from 48 Table of Contents bad debt expense recorded in 2009 on an accounts receivable balance we deemed uncollectible partially offset by $1 million in other net 2010 cost increases primarily reflecting incentive compensation. The $7 million increase in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR growth associated with stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The $3 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected fees earned and due from one property in 2010 that were calculated based on prior periods results. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,261 million in 2010, compared to $1,143 million in 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 In 2009, across our Luxury Lodging segment, we added 5 properties (916 rooms) and 1 property (374 rooms) left the system. In addition, we added 3 residential products (453 units) in 2009. In 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties decreased by 22.7 percent to $175.66, occupancy for these properties decreased by 6.8 percentage points to 59.5 percent, and average daily rates decreased by 13.8 percent to $295.11. Luxury Lodging was particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business. The $61 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2008, reflected a $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings, a $17 million decrease in base management fees, $13 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $6 million decrease in incentive management fees, and $5 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses. The $20 million decrease in joint venture equity earnings primarily reflected a $30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired, partially offset by a $9 million impairment charge associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired in 2008 (see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information). The $17 million decrease in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR declines associated with weaker demand. The $6 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower property level revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008, a result of weak demand, partially offset by property level cost controls and new unit growth. The $13 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $5 million of lower results at three properties driven by weak demand and the resulting RevPAR declines in 2009 and $6 million of lower residential branding fees. The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses in 2009 reflected $4 million in bad debt expense related to an accounts receivable balance we deemed to be uncollectible, $5 million of expenses primarily related to write offs of other assets that we deemed non recoverable, $3 million in start up costs related to a new brand, and a $2 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by $9 million in cost reductions related to our cost containment efforts. Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury segment properties totaled $1,143 million in 2009, compared to $1,350 million in 2008. 49 Table of Contents Timeshare includes our Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Club and Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands worldwide.

Timeshare segment contract sales increased by $20 million to $685 million in 2010 from $665 million in 2009 primarily reflecting a $28 million increase in residential contract sales and a $26 million increase in fractional contract sales, mostly offset by a $34 million decrease in timeshare contract sales. Sales of timeshare intervals were hurt by tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $63 million decrease in cancellation allowances we recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. The $107 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,546 million from $1,439 million in 2009 primarily reflected a $98 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $6 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and a $3 million increase in base management fees. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income associated with the impact of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards and, to a lesser extent, higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancies and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily due to tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, and a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default). 50 Table of Contents Segment income of $121 million in 2010 increased by $800 million from $679 million of segment losses in 2009, and primarily reflected a favorable variance from the $685 million of impairments recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher 2010 Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $45 million of lower restructuring costs compared with 2009, $18 million increase in gains and other income, $3 million increase in base management fees, and $4 million of lower joint venture equity losses partially offset by a $55 million increase in interest expense, an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest, and $5 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. The $116 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue net of expense, partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated previously. The $20 million unfavorable impact to development revenue related to the reserve for uncollectible accounts was partially offset by a favorable impact in product costs, resulting in a net $12 million increase in reserves. The $78 million increase in financing revenue, net of expense, primarily reflected: (1) a net $141 million increase in interest income, reflecting a $147 million increase from the notes receivable we now consolidate associated with past securitization transactions as part of our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in interest income related to non securitized notes receivable reflecting a lower outstanding balance; and (2) a favorable variance from a $20 million charge in 2009 related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests. These favorable variances were partially offset by $42 million of decreased residual interest accretion reflecting the elimination of residual interests as part of our 2010 adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $37 million of gain on notes sold in 2009, and $3 million of other net expenses. The $8 million increase in other revenue net of expense primarily reflected a $15 million favorable adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability resulting from lower than anticipated cost of redemptions, as well as $6 million of higher other miscellaneous revenue, partially offset by $13 million of net costs in excess of enrollment revenue related to the new points based program. The $11 million increase in services revenue net of expenses primarily reflected higher rental revenue associated with increased transient demand. The $55 million in interest expense was a result of the consolidation of debt obligations due to our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. Gains and other income increased by $18 million, primarily due to the sale of one property in the 2010 fourth quarter. The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the anticipated disposition of a golf course and related assets. Partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a $7 million write off of capitalized software development costs in 2009 related to a project for which we decided not to pursue further development. For additional information regarding the impairment charge recorded in 2010, see Footnote No. 8, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to our Financial Statements. Joint venture equity losses decreased by $4 million and primarily reflected higher cancellation allowances recorded at a joint venture in 2009. The $11 million decrease to zero in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interest was associated with our acquisition of that noncontrolling interest. See Footnote No. 20, Variable Interest Entities, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. 2009 Compared to 2008 Timeshare segment contract sales decreased by $411 million (38 percent), compared to 2008, to $665 million from $1,076 million. The decrease in Timeshare segment contract sales in 2009, compared to 2008, reflected a $396 million decrease in timeshare contract sales and a $22 million decrease in fractional contract sales, partially offset by $7 million of lower residential net cancellation allowances on contract sales. Sales of fractional and timeshare intervals decreased significantly as a result of weak demand, but were partially offset by a decrease in cancellation allowances of $32 million, as compared with prior year, recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing (see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for additional information). 51 Table of Contents The $311 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,439 million from $1,750 million primarily reflected a $300 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $16 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, partially offset by a $5 million increase in base management fees. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to 2008 and higher financing revenue. Timeshare segment revenues in 2009 and 2008 included note securitization gains of $37 million and $16 million, respectively. Segment losses of $679 million in 2009 increased by $707 million from $28 million of segment income in 2008, and reflected $685 million of impairments (See Footnote No. 20, Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information on the impairments), $17 million of higher restructuring costs, $23 million in lower joint venture equity earnings, a $14 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, and $6 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by $31 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses and $5 million of higher base management fees. The $6 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses, mostly offset by $43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses, $15 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses, and $3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue, net of expenses. Lower development revenue net of product, marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, lower revenue net of costs for our Asia Pacific points program, and a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority, partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a $22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate ($10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit) and a $9 million 2008 inventory write down related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in Europe. The $43 million increase in financing revenue, net of financing costs, primarily reflected: (1) a $21 million increase in note securitization gains, from $16 million in 2008, which included a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness, to $37 million in 2009, due to only one note securitization in 2008 as compared with two note securitizations in 2009; (2) $22 million of increased residual interest accretion reflecting incremental accretion from the second quarter 2008, first quarter 2009, and fourth quarter 2009 note securitizations; (3) a $12 million decrease in the charge that reduced the valuation of residual interests to $20 million in 2009 from $32 million in 2008; and (4) a $13 million decrease in the cost of financing due to cost containment efforts. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $22 million of lower interest income because of lower notes receivable balances in 2009 due to the completion of the 2009 second and fourth quarter note securitizations; and $5 million of lower settlement revenue, net of expenses, due to lower settlement volume. The $20 million recorded charge for the reduced value of residual interests in 2009 consisted of a $19 million unfavorable impact for eight previously securitized pools that reached performance triggers as a result of increased defaults in 2009, partially offset by a $4 million benefit for the release of seven of the eight performance triggers later in 2009 due to improved loan performance, and a $5 million net unfavorable impact from changes in the assumptions for discount, default and prepayment rates that we used in our estimate of fair market value (see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for more information). The $17 million decrease in services revenue net of expenses was driven by lower rental revenue due to the weak demand and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory. The $15 million increase in other revenue, net of expenses, was primarily a result of higher marketing and sales revenue. The $17 million increase in restructuring costs reflected a $24 million increase in facilities exit costs and $1 million increase in severance costs, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in development cancellations (see the Restructuring Costs and Other Charges section of our 2009 Form 10 K for additional information). The $31 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses reflected $33 million in cost savings primarily generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions and other cost reductions and a $4 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008, partially offset by a $7 million 2009 write off of capitalized software development costs related to a project for which we have decided not to pursue further development. See Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K for additional information on the write off of capitalized software costs. Joint venture equity earnings decreased by $23 million and primarily reflected decreased earnings from a joint venture, attributable to weak 2009 demand for a residential and fractional project. 52 Table of Contents The $14 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to a $12 million noncontrolling interest benefit recorded in 2008 related to an impairment of a joint venture we consolidate. MARRIOTT VACATION CLUB DESTINATIONS TIMESHARE PROGRAM During our 2010 third quarter, we launched the points based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (the MVCD Program) in North America and the Caribbean. Under the MVCD Program, we sell beneficial interests in a domestic land trust. Based on the number of beneficial interests purchased, MVCD members receive an annual allocation of Vacation Club Points to redeem for travel at numerous destinations. Although the existing rights and privileges of owners of weeks based intervals are unchanged, those owners now also have the option of enrolling in the Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Exchange Program, which affords them the opportunity to trade their weeks based intervals for Vacation Club Points usage each year, as well as to purchase additional product in increments of less than one week. Since the MVCD Program is a significant change from our prior approach to the timeshare business, we have focused our marketing efforts on existing owners, to encourage participation and purchase of additional product. Early results have exceeded our expectations. We believe the MVCD Program will appeal to a broader demographic than our prior weeks based program by providing our owners with more flexible usage options, including the use of points for tailored vacation experiences, and by allowing us to sell our resort system at all locations, including those where few or no weeks were still available. We expect that the MVCD Program will result in fewer resorts under construction at any given time and allow us to better leverage successful sales centers at completed resorts. With less invested in inventory, the MVCD Program also should allow us to improve returns on investment. Revenue recognition for the MVCD Program follows our Timeshare Points Based Use System revenue recognition policy (see Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements). The timing of revenue recognition for this program approximates contract sales because we expect to sell fully completed inventory for the foreseeable future. With more efficient inventory management, we expect to have lower unsold maintenance fee expense, which should enhance profitability over time. In addition to capitalized costs for internally developed software and licensing fees of $14 million, we incurred costs for the MVCD Program in 2010 of approximately $20 million (which included $12 million of start up costs). Costs in excess of enrollment revenue for the new points based program totaled $13 million and is reflected in our Income Statement in Timeshare sales and service, net of direct expenses. Given the amount of inventory we have, we do not expect to develop new timeshare resorts in the near term. PROPOSED SPIN OFF OF TIMESHARE OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS On February 14, 2011, we announced a plan to split the companys businesses into two separate, publicly traded companies. Under the plan, we expect to spin off our timeshare operations and development business as a new independent company through a special tax free dividend to our shareholders in late 2011. Please see Footnote No. 24, Subsequent Event, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Synthetic Fuel Prior to 2008 we operated four coal based synthetic fuel production facilities (the Facilities). Because tax credits under IRC Section 45K were not available for coal based synthetic fuels produced or sold after calendar year 2007, and because we estimated that high oil prices during 2007 would result in the phase out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, we shut down the Facilities in our 2007 fourth quarter and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, Discontinued Operations Synthetic Fuel, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding our former Synthetic Fuel segment. SHARE BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (Stock Option Program); (2) stock appreciation rights (SARs) for our Class A Common Stock (Stock Appreciation Program); (3) restricted stock units (RSUs) of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 53 Table of Contents During 2010, we granted 3.8 million RSUs and 1.1 million Employee SARs. See Footnote No. 4, Share Based Compensation, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for information related to our adoption of new accounting standards in 2010 and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities Our Credit Facility, which expires on May 14, 2012, and associated letters of credit, provide for $2.4 billion of aggregate effective borrowings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed spread based on the credit ratings for our public debt. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information on our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to our Current Report on Form 8 K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2007. Although our Credit Facility does not expire until 2012, we expect that we may extend or replace it during 2011. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we need to do so in the future. We believe the Credit Facility, together with cash we expect to generate from operations and our ability to raise capital, remains adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements. At year end 2010, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2.831 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $2.326 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $505 million. We calculate that borrowing capacity by taking $2.404 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $78 million of outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility. During 2010, we repaid our outstanding Credit Facility borrowings and had no outstanding balance at year end. As noted in the previous paragraphs, we anticipate that this available capacity will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facilitys covenants, we also expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly. Cash from Operations Cash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash from operations $ 1,151 $ 868 $ 641 Depreciation expense 138 151 155 Amortization expense 40 34 35 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 1.4 to 1.0 at year end 2010 and 1.2 to 1.0 at year end 2009. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. 54 Table of Contents Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K, are as follows: Fiscal Years 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2.9x * 3.1x 4.3x 5.3x * In 2009, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by approximately $364 million. Timeshare Cash Flows. In conjunction with our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards in the 2010 first quarter, as discussed in more detail in Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements we no longer account for note receivable securitizations as sales, but rather as secured borrowings as defined in the new standards, and accordingly did not recognize gains or losses on the 2010 notes receivable securitization nor do we expect to recognize gains or losses on future note receivable securitizations. As part of our adoption of the new standards, we classify the following 2010 activities as Financing Activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: (1) payments on the newly recorded debt obligations as repayments of long term debt ($231 million); (2) note repurchases (classified in Timeshare activity, net under Operating Activities for 2009 and 2008) as repayments of long term debt ($93 million); and (3) proceeds on any note securitizations as issuance of long term debt ($215 million) (classified in Timeshare activity, net under Operating Activities for 2009 and 2008). Also, we no longer have any cash flow activity related to residual interests or servicing assets. We will continue to classify any collections on held notes receivable, as well as the notes receivable we reestablished in the 2010 first quarter associated with past securitization transactions, as Timeshare activity, net in Operating Activities. In response to lower demand for our Timeshare products, we have correspondingly reduced our projected investment in new Timeshare development. While our Timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments. The following table shows the net operating activity from our Timeshare segment (which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our Timeshare segment). In 2010, 2009, and 2008, new Timeshare segment mortgages were $256 million, $302 million, and $747 million, respectively, and collections totaled $347 million (which included collections on securitized notes of $230 million), $155 million, and $222 million, respectively. ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Timeshare segment development less than (in excess of) cost of sales $ 15 $ (4 ) $ (299 ) Timeshare segment collections (net of new mortgages) 91 (147 ) (525 ) Note repurchases 0 (81 ) (56 ) Financially reportable sales less than closed sales 58 29 126 Note securitization gains 0 (37 ) (16 ) Note securitization proceeds 0 349 237 Collection on retained interests in securitized notes and servicing fees 0 82 102 Other cash inflows (outflows) 52 (45 ) 33 Net cash inflows (outflows) from Timeshare segment activity $ 216 $ 146 $ (398 ) See Footnote No. 13, Long term Debt, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on the failure of some Timeshare securitized notes receivable pools to perform within established parameters and the resulting redirection of cash flows. In 2010, seven securitized notes receivable pools reached performance triggers in different months throughout the year as a result of increased defaults. As of year end 2010, of the seven pools out of compliance during 2010, loan performance had improved sufficiently in six pools to cure the performance triggers, leaving one pool out of compliance. Approximately $6 million of cash flows in 2010 and $17 million of cash flows in 2009 were redirected as a result of reaching the performance triggers for those years. None of our pools experienced performance triggers in 2008, so no cash flow was redirected during that year. On November 12, 2010, we securitized a pool of approximately $229 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity (the 2010 1 Trust). Simultaneous with the securitization, investors purchased approximately $218 million in Timeshare Loan Backed Notes from the 2010 1 Trust in a private placement in two classes. Class A Notes totaling approximately $195 million with an interest rate of 3.54 percent and Class B Notes totaling approximately $23 million with an interest rate of 4.52 percent. As consideration for our securitization of the timeshare mortgage loans, we received cash proceeds of approximately $215 million, net of costs, and a subordinated residual interest in the 2010 1 Trust, through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time. Under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, we accounted for this transaction as a secured borrowing in 2010 and we did not record a gain or loss. 55 Table of Contents On October 20, 2010, we exercised our option for the Term 2002 transaction to repurchase all outstanding collateral, payoff and redeem all outstanding bonds, and terminate the associated trust, which resulted in cash outflows from the Company of approximately $25 million. On March 9, 2009, we completed a private placement of approximately $205 million of floating rate Timeshare Loan Backed Notes with a bank administered commercial paper conduit. We contributed approximately $284 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the securitization of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products to a newly formed special purpose entity (the 2009 1 Trust). On the same day, the 2009 1 Trust issued approximately $205 million of the 2009 1 Trusts notes. In connection with the private placement of notes receivable, we received proceeds of approximately $181 million, net of costs, and retained $94 million of residual interests in the special purpose entity, which included $81 million of notes we effectively owned after the transfer and $13 million related to the servicing assets and interest only strip. We measured all residual interests at fair market value on the date of the transfer. We recorded the notes that we effectively owned after the transfer as notes receivable. In connection with this March 2009 note securitization, we recorded a $1 million loss, which we included in the Timeshare sales and services line item in our Income Statement. On October 21, 2009, we securitized a pool of approximately $380 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity (the 2009 2 Trust). Simultaneous with the securitization, investors purchased $317 million of 4.809 percent Timeshare Loan Backed Notes from the 2009 2 Trust in a private placement. As part of this transaction, we paid off the notes that the 2009 1 Trust issued in March 2009 and reacquired approximately $233 million of timeshare mortgage loans that were released from the 2009 1 Trust. We included approximately $218 million of these reacquired loans in the October 21, 2009 securitization. As consideration for our securitization of the timeshare mortgage loans, we received cash proceeds of approximately $168 million and a subordinated residual interest in the 2009 2 Trust, through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time. These cash proceeds are net of approximately $145 million paid to the commercial paper conduit to unwind the first quarter transaction. In connection with this October 2009 note securitization, we recorded a $38 million gain, which we included in the Timeshare sales and services line item in our Income Statement. On June 10, 2008, we securitized to a newly formed special purpose entity (the 2008 1 Trust) $300 million of notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. On the same day, the 2008 1 Trust issued $246 million of the 2008 1 Trusts notes. In connection with the securitization of notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $237 million. We retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of $93 million. We recorded note securitization gains totaling $16 million in 2008, which was net of a $12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness which we included in the Timeshare sales and services line item in our Income Statement. We had residual interests of $214 million at year end 2009, which we recorded in the accompanying Balance Sheet as other long term receivables of $144 million and other current assets of $70 million. Our servicing assets and residual interests, which we measured at year end 2009 using Level 3 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy (which we described in our 2009 Form 10 K in Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements), accounted for 91 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at year end 2009 that were required to be measured at fair value using the then applicable fair value measurement guidance. We treated the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and accordingly, we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Income Statements. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded trading gains of $18 million and losses of $9 million, respectively. See Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on residual interests eliminated as part of the adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards in the first quarter of 2010. For additional information on our timeshare note securitizations, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, see Footnote No. 12, Asset Securitizations, of the Notes to our Financial Statements. See also Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Footnote No. 20, Variable Interest Entities, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for the impact of adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. We estimate that, for the 20 year period from 2011 through 2030, the cash flow associated with completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately $2.8 billion. This estimate is based on our current development plans, which remain subject to change. 56 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash Flows Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $307 million in 2010, $147 million in 2009, and $357 million in 2008 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which we include in Cash from Operations, as noted in that section, are not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures increased primarily due to our purchase of two hotel properties in 2010. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments. Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging and Timeshare segments because: (1) we own less than one percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure. Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $114 million in 2010, $2 million in 2009, and $38 million in 2008. Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Collections and sales for such loans, net of advances during 2010 and 2009, amounted to net loan advances of $6 million in 2010 and net loan advances of $45 million in 2009. At year end 2010, we had no senior loans and $191 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $7 million) outstanding, compared with $1 million in senior loans (including a current portion of $1 million) and $195 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $95 million) outstanding at year end 2009. In 2010, our notes receivable balance associated with senior, mezzanine, and other loans decreased by $4 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans. See the Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans caption in Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $29 million in 2010, $28 million in 2009, and $25 million in 2008 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures. Cash from Financing Activities Debt. Debt increased by $531 million in 2010, to $2,829 million at year end 2010 from $2,298 million at year end 2009, and reflected consolidation (in conjunction with our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards) of debt with a balance at year end 2010 of $1,016 million, partially offset by decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility of $425 million and other net debt decreases of $60 million. Debt decreased by $797 million in 2009, to $2,298 million at year end 2009 from $3,095 million at year end 2008, and reflected a $544 million decrease in borrowings under our Credit Facility, the repayment, upon maturity, of $79 million (including interest) of Series C Senior Notes in 2009, the repurchase of $119 million in book value ($122 million in principal amount) of Senior Notes across multiple series, and other debt decreases of $57 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2010, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 5.6 percent and an average maturity of approximately 8.9 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.99 to 1.0 at year end 2010. See the Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities, caption within this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on our Credit Facility. During 2010, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, which had a balance outstanding at year end 2009 of $425 million. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million. In 2008, we repurchased $109 million of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $28 million for the debt extinguishment 57 Table of Contents representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $77 million and its carrying amount of $105 million of the debt. Share Repurchases. We purchased 1.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2010 at an average price of $39.02 per share, did not purchase any shares in 2009, and purchased 11.9 million shares in 2008 at an average price of $31.18 per share. On November 4, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 4 million additional shares, bringing the total outstanding purchase authorization on that date to approximately 25 million shares. We purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of year end 2010, 23.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our Board of Directors. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per share on April 9, May 7, and August 5, 2010, respectively, and a cash dividend of $0.0875 per share on November 4, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of year end 2010: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Debt (1) $ 3,424 $ 282 $ 1,256 $ 744 $ 1,142 Capital lease obligations (1) 9 1 2 2 4 Operating leases where we are the primary obligor: Recourse 1,174 128 243 206 597 Non recourse 337 15 31 26 265 Operating leases where we are secondarily liable 58 18 27 12 1 Purchase obligations 11 8 2 1 0 Other long term liabilities 108 0 21 6 81 Total contractual obligations $ 5,121 $ 452 $ 1,582 $ 997 $ 2,090 (1) Includes principal as well as interest payments. The preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as of year end 2010 of $39 million. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. Although we do not anticipate that those audits will have a significant impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance during the next 52 weeks, it remains possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change over that time period. See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information. The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year end 2010: Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor $ 199 $ 33 $ 59 $ 50 $ 57 Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable 185 43 87 29 26 Total guarantee commitments $ 384 $ 76 $ 146 $ 79 $ 83 In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided two project completion guarantees in favor of lenders: A guarantee with an estimated aggregate total cost of $592 million, and a $16 million carrying value for our associated liability as of year end 2010, as further discussed in Footnote No. 20, Variable Interest Entities, of the Notes to our Financial Statements; and A guarantee with an estimated aggregate total cost of Canadian $491 million ($491 million), and a $3 million carrying value for our associated liability as of year end 2010. During 2010, our joint venture partners executed documents indemnifying us for any payments that may be required in connection with this guarantee. 58 Table of Contents For additional information on these project completion guarantees, including our pro rata ownership percentages in the associated entities, as well as additional information on our guarantees, including their nature and the circumstances under which they were entered into, see the Guarantees caption within Footnote No. 16, Contingencies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements. In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner. We also had the following other commitments, including loan and investment commitments, outstanding at year end 2010: Loan and Investment Commitments Amount of Loan and Investment Commitments Expected Funding By Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total loan commitments $ 1 $ 0 $ 1 $ 0 $ 0 Total investment commitments 129 95 3 31 0 Total other commitments $ 130 $ 95 $ 4 $ 31 $ 0 For further information on our loan and investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the Commitments and Letters of Credit caption within Footnote No. 16, Contingencies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements. At year end 2010, we also had $81 million of letters of credit outstanding ($78 million under our Credit Facility and $3 million outside the Credit Facility), the majority of which related to our self insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year end 2010 totaled $219 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self insurance programs. In the normal course of the hotel management business, we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners. Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive fees. In some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 49 percent. For other information regarding these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 22, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to our Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Please see Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on: 59 Table of Contents Marriott Rewards and The Ritz Carlton Rewards, our frequent guest rewards programs, including how members earn points, how we determine the fair value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue related to these programs; Valuation of Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill; Valuation of Intangibles and Long Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long lived assets; Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures; Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies; Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; Loan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans and for Loans to Timeshare Owners, including information on how we measure impairment on each of these types of loans. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how such exposure is managed in the future. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt. We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities. We account for our investments as available for sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year end 2010, our investments had a fair value of $18 million. We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year end 2010, our Balance Sheet included a $1 million liability for currency exchange derivatives and a $1 million liability for interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments. Please see Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information associated with derivative instruments. 60 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year end 2010 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period ($ in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValue Assets Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.
