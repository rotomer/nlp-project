Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.BUSINESS AND OVERVIEWUnder numerous brand names in 73 countries and territories, we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels, corporate housing properties, and timeshare properties. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. At year end 2011, our system was comprised of 3,718 properties (643,196 rooms). The figures in the preceding sentence include 32 home and condominium products (3,838 units) for which we manage the related owners associations. In addition, we provided 2,166 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. At year end 2011, our operations are grouped into four business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. On November 21, 2011 ("the spin off date"), we completed a spin off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation ("MVW"). In connection with the spin off, we entered into several agreements with MVW, and, in some cases, certain of its subsidiaries, that govern our post spin off relationship with MVW, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement and two License Agreements for the use of Marriott and Ritz Carlton marks and intellectual property. Under license agreements with us, MVW is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare, fractional, and related products under the Marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under The Ritz Carlton brand. We receive license fees under these license agreements.Because of our significant continuing involvement in MVW future operations (by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and MVW), our former Timeshare segments historical financial results prior to the spin off date will continue to be included in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations. Please see Footnote No. 17, Spin off, of the Notes to our Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors; Other Risks for additional information. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also earn fees from credit card endorsements, the sale of branded residential real estate, and licensing the Marriott timeshare and fractional and Ritz Carlton fractional brands to MVW. Prior to the spin off of our Timeshare business, we also generated revenues from the following sources: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals, all of which we included in our Timeshare segment.We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand alone basis under The Ritz Carlton brand (The Ritz Carlton Residences). Residences are typically constructed and sold by third party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive.Lodging Conditions for our lodging business improved in 2011 reflecting generally low supply growth, a more favorable economic climate in most developed markets around the world, albeit at a generally low growth rate, and stronger economic growth in emerging markets, strong unit growth, and the impact of operating efficiencies across our company. While economic growth in Europe slowed in the later part of 2011 and the level of economic growth is uncertain in the United States, we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control our costs. In 2011, as compared to 2010, worldwide average daily rates increased 3.4 percent on a constant dollar basis to $133.26 for comparable systemwide properties, with RevPAR increasing 6.4 percent to $92.69 and occupancy increasing 2.0 percentage points to 69.6 percent.For properties in North America in 2011, markets in the West reflected strong demand, while properties in the East and South reflected more moderate demand. In Washington, D.C., a shorter Congressional calendar and government spending concerns reduced lodging demand. For properties in China and Brazil, demand was particularly strong during 2011, while for properties in Europe, demand was more moderate reflecting the financial crisis and related economic concerns. Demand at properties in the Middle East remained weak reflecting continued unrest in that region, and demand outside of the more metropolitan regions in Britain remained weak as a result of government austerity measures. While demand in Japan was weak in the first quarter of 2011 reflecting the impact of the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, domestic demand began to 24Table of Contentsimprove in the 2011 second quarter and continued throughout the rest of 2011, but remained below 2010 levels. We monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels. We modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010 and that improvement continued in 2011, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates.The hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers. Overall, business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2011, while group demand continues to improve. Group customers typically book rooms and meeting space with significant lead times, sometimes several years in advance of guest arrival. Typically, two thirds of group business is booked prior to the year of arrival and one third is booked in the year of arrival. During an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. Group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off, and with improving group demand, is being replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates.Negotiated corporate business (special corporate business) represented 14 percent of our full service hotel room nights for 2011 in North America. We typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply, which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly. For 2012, we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business clients in the first quarter, and we expect rates to be higher than the prior year. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non room spend, and aggregate spend. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. Where appropriate for market conditions, we have maintained many of our 2009 property level cost saving initiatives regarding menus and restaurant hours, room amenities, cross training personnel, and utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible. We also control above property costs, which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we continue to require (where legally permitted) or encourage employees to use their vacation time accrued during the year.Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We also remove hotels from our system that no longer meet our standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information rich, and easy to use website, Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property level reservations via this cost efficient channel. We completed the roll out of our sales deployment strategy in 2011, which aligns our sales efforts around customer needs, reducing duplication of sales efforts, and enabling coverage for a larger number of accounts. We now have the systems, training, and incentives for sales associates to sell our represented hotels as a portfolio rather than solely on a hotel by hotel basis. Our largest properties continue to have sales staff assigned on property. In 2011, we also implemented innovative technology solutions, including our Retail Pricing Optimizer tool ("RPO") and our High Performance Pricing tool ("HPP"). RPO determines optimal transient retail (benchmark) rates for hotels using an analytically driven and market based methodology. We believe this technology provides a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increases efficiency in analysis and decision making, and produces increased property level revenue for transient retail and associated segments. HPP enables hotels to more effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes using web based functionality. The streamlined process provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year end 2011, we operated 44 percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements, we owned or leased 2 percent, and 1 percent were operated or franchised through unconsolidated joint ventures. Our emphasis on long term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. This strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make.We consider RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in 25Table of Contentsroom revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Constant dollar statistics are calculated by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.Company operated house profit margin is the ratio of property level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.Timeshare As noted previously, on November 21, 2011, we completed a spin off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary MVW. In preparing our former Timeshare segment to operate as an independent, publicly traded company following the spin off of the stock of MVW management assessed the Timeshare segments intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets. On September 8, 2011, management approved a plan for our former Timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land and excess built luxury inventory. As a result, we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after tax) in our 2011 Income Statement under the "Timeshare strategy impairment charges" caption. We discuss these charges in more detail under the caption "Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges" later in this Managements Discussion and Analysis section. Also see the "Timeshare" caption later in this Managements Discussion and Analysis section, for additional information on the results of operations.CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThe following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2011, 2010, and 2009. The results for 2011 include the results of the former Timeshare segment prior to the spin off date while 2010 and 2009 included the former Timeshare segment for the entire fiscal year. See the Timeshare segment discussion later in this report for additional information.Revenues 2011 Compared to 2010Revenues increased by $626 million (5 percent) to $12,317 million in 2011 from $11,691 million in 2010, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($604 million); base management and franchise fees ($105 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($37 million); and incentive management fees ($13 million (all from properties outside of North America)). These favorable variances were partially offset by lower Timeshare sales and services revenue ($133 million).The increases in base management fees, to $602 million in 2011 from $562 million in 2010, and in franchise fees, to $506 million in 2011 from $441 million in 2010, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates. Base management fees in 2011 included $51 million associated with the timeshare business compared to $55 million in the prior year. Franchise fees in 2011 included $4 million associated with MVW license fees. The increase in incentive management fees from $182 million in 2010 to $195 million in 2011 primarily reflected higher net property level income resulting from higher property level revenue and continued property level cost controls and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates.The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,083 million in 2011, from $1,046 million in 2010, reflected $21 million of higher total branding fees, $7 million of higher corporate housing revenue, $4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue. Combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $99 million and $78 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,088 million in 2011, from $1,221 million in 2010, primarily 26Table of Contentsreflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue which reflected the spin off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance prior to the spin off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue, which primarily reflected the spin off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue which reflected the spin off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates prior to the spin off date. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment.Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,843 million in 2011 from $8,239 million in 2010, reflected the impact of higher property level demand and growth across the system.2010 Compared to 2009Revenues increased by $783 million (7 percent) to $11,691 million in 2010 from $10,908 million in 2009, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($557 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($98 million); base management and franchise fees ($73 million); incentive management fees ($28 million (comprised of a $12 million increase for North America and a $16 million increase outside of North America)); and owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($27 million).The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,221 million in 2010, from $1,123 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default), and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the MVCD Program. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment.The increases in base management fees, to $562 million in 2010 from $530 million in 2009, and in franchise fees, to $441 million in 2010 from $400 million in 2009, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system. The increase in incentive management fees, to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth.The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,046 million in 2010, from $1,019 million in 2009, largely reflected $14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system, $8 million of higher branding fees, $6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties, and $5 million of higher other revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a one time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. The increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased RevPAR and occupancy levels. Combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $78 million and $70 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,239 million in 2010 from $7,682 million in 2009, reflected the impact of growth across the system, partially offset by lower property level costs in response to cost controls. Net of hotels exiting the system, we added 4,287 managed rooms and 17,024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010.Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges 2011 ChargesIn preparing our former Timeshare segment to operate as an independent, publicly traded company following our spin off of the stock of MVW (see Footnote No. 17, "Spin off" for additional information), management assessed the Timeshare segments intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets. On September 8, 2011, management approved a plan for the Timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land in the U.S., Mexico, and the Bahamas over the next 18 to 24 months and to accelerate sales of excess built luxury fractional and residential inventory over the next three years. As a result, in accordance with the guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets, because the nominal cash flows from the planned land sales and the estimated fair values of the land and excess built luxury inventory were less than their respective carrying values, we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after tax) in our 2011 Income 27Table of ContentsStatement under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption. 2009 ChargesIn 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Income Statement ($502 million after tax), including $614 million of pretax charges that impacted operating income under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption, and $138 million of pretax charges that impacted non operating income under the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments.For additional information related to the 2009 and 2011 impairment charges, including how these impairments were determined, the impairment charges grouped by product type and or geographic location, and a table showing the composition of the charges, see Footnote No. 18, Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges.Restructuring Costs and Other Charges As part of the restructuring actions we began in 2008, we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our former Timeshare segment, hotel development, above property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. For additional information on the 2009 restructuring costs, including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment, please see Footnote No. 21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K. For the cumulative restructuring costs incurred since inception, please see Footnote No. 19, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, of the Notes to our Financial Statements in this Form 10 K.As a result of our restructuring efforts, we realized the following annual cost savings in 2010 and 2009, respectively, which were primarily reflected in our Income Statement under the expense captions noted: (i) $113 million ($73 million after tax) and $80 million to $85 million ($48 million to $52 million after tax) for our former Timeshare segment, under Timeshare direct and General, administrative, and other; (ii) $12 million ($8 million after tax) and $9 million ($5 million after tax) for hotel development across several of our Lodging segments, primarily under General, administrative, and other; and (iii) $10 million ($8 million after tax) and $8 million ($5 million after tax) for reducing above property level lodging management personnel under General, administrative, and other.Operating Income (Loss)2011 Compared to 2010Operating income decreased by $169 million to $526 million in 2011 from $695 million in 2010. The decrease reflected Timeshare strategy impairment charges of $324 million recorded in 2011 and $40 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $105 million increase in base management and franchise fees, $49 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, a $28 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses, and $13 million of higher incentive management fees. We address the reasons for the increases in base management and franchise fees and in incentive management fees as compared to 2010 in the preceding Revenues section.The $49 million (54 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $21 million of higher branding fees, $15 million of net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property level margins, $6 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, net of 2010 termination costs, $6 million of higher corporate housing and other revenue, net of expenses, and $5 million of decreased rent expense, partially offset by $4 million of lower results at a leased hotel in Japan that experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year.General, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $28 million (4 percent) to $752 million in 2011 from $780 million in 2010. The decrease primarily reflected favorable variances from the following items recorded in 2010: an $84 million long lived asset impairment charge associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a $13 million long lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our former Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our North American Limited Service segment). Also contributing to the decrease in expenses, was $9 million of lower former Timeshare segment expenses due to the spin off and a $5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision related to one property with increased expected future cash flows. These favorable variances were partially offset by the following items recorded in 2011: $34 million of transaction related expenses associated with the spin off of the timeshare business; $17 million of higher compensation costs; $10 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets and initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, a $5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both related 28Table of Contentsto one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; a $5 million performance cure payment for a North American Full Service property; and $7 million related to an increase in the guarantee reserves for one International and one North American Full Service property, primarily due to cash flow shortfalls at the properties, and a $2 million write off of contract acquisition costs associated with two other properties. Unfavorable variances from a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States and a $6 million reversal of guarantee accruals, primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements, both recorded in 2010, further offset the aforementioned favorable variances. The $28 million decrease in total general, administrative, and other expenses consisted of a $34 million decrease that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $22 million decrease allocated to our former Timeshare segment; and a $12 million decrease allocated to our North American Limited Service segment; partially offset by a $20 million increase allocated to our Luxury segment; a $15 million increase allocated to our International segment; and a $5 million increase allocated to our North American Full Service segment.Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses totaled $159 million in 2011 and $199 million in 2010. The decrease of $40 million as compared to 2010, primarily reflected $28 million of lower other revenue, net of expenses and $25 million of lower financing revenue, net of expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $5 million of higher services revenue, net of expenses. The $28 million decrease in other revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected a $15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability in the prior year and, to a lesser extent in the current year reflected the impact of the spin off as well as lower resales revenue, net of expenses due to lower closings. The $25 million decrease in financing revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spin off as well as lower notes receivable balances prior to the spin off date. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net $12 million reserve in the prior year, partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spin off. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment prior to spin off.2010 Compared to 2009Operating income increased by $847 million to operating income of $695 million in 2010 from an operating loss of $152 million in 2009. The increase in operating income reflected a favorable variance of $614 million related to Timeshare strategy impairment charges recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees, a $51 million decrease in restructuring costs, $28 million of higher incentive management fees, and $23 million of higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $58 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. We note the reasons for the increase of $73 million in base management and franchise fees as well as the increase of $28 million in incentive management fees as compared to 2009 in the preceding Revenues section.Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2010 totaled $199 million. The increase of $116 million as compared to 2009, primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, which largely reflected increased interest income associated with the impact of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitized notes under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue, net of expenses partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower product costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated in the preceding Revenues section. See BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare, later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment prior to spin off.The $23 million (34 percent) increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to $12 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of property closing costs, $8 million of higher branding fees, a $4 million reversal of a liability related to a hotel that closed in 2010, and net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher RevPAR and property level margins, partially offset by additional rent expense associated with one property and an unfavorable variance from a one time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009.General, administrative, and other expenses increased by $58 million (8 percent) to $780 million in 2010 from $722 million in 2009. The increase primarily reflected the following 2010 charges: an $84 million long lived asset impairment charge associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset (which we did not allocate to any of our segments); a 29Table of Contents$13 million long lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our former Timeshare segment); and a $14 million long lived asset impairment charge (allocated to our North American Limited Service segment). See Footnote No. 7, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on these three impairment charges. In addition, we recorded a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge (allocated to our North American Full Service segment) in 2010. See the North American Full Service segment discussion for additional information on this impairment charge. Also contributing to the year over year increase was $35 million of higher compensation costs, $14 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with initiatives to enhance our brands globally, $7 million of increased currency exchange losses, and $2 million of increased legal expenses. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by an $8 million reversal in 2010 of guarantee accruals, primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements, and a $4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the United States. In addition, the comparison reflects the following 2009 expenses that we did not incur in 2010: $49 million of impairment charges related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by an $11 million reversal of the 2008 accrual for the funding of those cash flow shortfalls; a $7 million write off of Timeshare segment capitalized software costs; and $4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance. The year over year comparison also reflected a $15 million favorable variance in deferred compensation expenses (with changes to our deferred compensation plan, general, administrative, and other expenses for 2010 had no deferred compensation impact, compared with $15 million of mark to market valuation expenses in 2009). The increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was also partially offset by the elimination of the loan loss provision in 2010, compared with a $43 million provision in 2009, which reflected $29 million associated with one Luxury segment project and $14 million associated with a North American Limited Service segment portfolio.The $58 million increase in total general, administrative, and other expenses was comprised of: a $77 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments; a $5 million increase allocated to our former Timeshare segment; an $8 million decrease allocated to our North American Limited Service segment; an $8 million decrease allocated to our Luxury segment; a $7 million decrease allocated to our North American Full Service segment; and a $1 million decrease allocated to our International segment.(Losses) Gains and Other Income (Expense)We show our (losses) gains and other income for 2011, 2010, and 2009 in the following table: ($ in millions)2011 2010 2009Gain on debt extinguishment$ $ $21Gains on sales of real estate and other11 34 10Gain/(loss) on sale of joint venture and other investments$ $1 $3Income from cost method joint ventures 2Impairment of equity securities(18) (5) $(7) $35 $312011 Compared to 2010The $23 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from an $18 million gain on the sale of one Timeshare segment property in 2010. The $18 million impairment of equity securities in 2011 reflects an other than temporary impairment of marketable securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 2010 Compared to 2009We did not extinguish any debt in 2010. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. The $21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the $98 million purchase price and the $119 million net carrying amount of Senior Notes we repurchased during the period. The $5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. For additional information on the impairment, see Footnote No. 5, Fair Value Measurements, of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10 K.30Table of ContentsInterest Expense2011 Compared to 2010Interest expense decreased by $16 million (9 percent) to $164 million in 2011 compared to $180 million in 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by: (1) a $12 million decrease in interest expense on securitized notes, which reflected the transfer of these notes to MVW on the spin off date, as well as a lower average outstanding balance and a lower average interest rate on those notes prior to the spin off date; (2) a $2 million increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects; and (3) a $1 million decrease in interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, which reflected lower interest rates. See the LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES caption later in this report for additional information on our credit facility.2010 Compared to 2009Interest expense increased by $62 million (53 percent) to $180 million in 2010 compared to $118 million in 2009. This increase was driven by: (1) the consolidation of $1,121 million of debt in the 2010 first quarter associated with previously securitized notes, which resulted in a $55 million increase in interest expense in 2010 related to that debt; (2) a $14 million unfavorable variance from 2009 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2010 associated with construction projects; and (3) $12 million of higher interest expense in 2010 associated with our executive deferred compensation plan. These increases were partially offset by: (1) $12 million of lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of $122 million of principal amount of our Senior Notes in 2009, the maturity of our Series C Senior Notes in the 2009 fourth quarter and other net debt reductions; and (2) a $7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our previous $2.4 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, which primarily reflected lower average borrowings.Interest Income and Income Tax2011 Compared to 2010Interest income decreased by $5 million (26 percent) to $14 million in 2011 compared to $19 million in 2010, primarily reflecting a $3 million decrease associated with the repayment of certain loans. Our tax provision increased by $65 million (70 percent) to a tax provision of $158 million in 2011 from a tax provision of $93 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable variance related to a prior year IRS settlement on the treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries that resulted in an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 and $34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets that we transferred to MVW in conjunction with the spin off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business. We impaired these assets because we consider it "more likely than not" that MVW will be unable to realize the value of those deferred tax assets. Please see Footnote No. 17, "Spin off" of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on the transaction. The increases were partially offset by lower pretax income in 2011.2010 Compared to 2009Interest income decreased by $6 million (24 percent) to $19 million in 2010, compared to $25 million in 2009, primarily reflecting a $4 million decrease associated with a loan that we determined was impaired in 2009. Because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis, we did not recognize any interest on this loan after its impairment. The decline in interest income also reflected a $2 million decrease due to a reduction in principal due associated with one loan.Our income tax expense increased by $158 million (243 percent) to a provision of $93 million in 2010 from a benefit of $65 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to pretax income in 2010 (as compared to a pretax loss in 2009) and $14 million of higher tax expense associated with changes to our deferred compensation plan (there were no 2010 plan changes impacting deferred compensation expenses, compared with changes which had a $14 million favorable impact in 2009). The increase was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2010, as 2009 reflected $52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on our treatment of funds received from certain non U.S. subsidiaries. In conjunction with that settlement, we recorded an $85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010. Our 2010 income tax expense also reflected a $12 million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to prior years estimated foreign tax expense.Equity in (Losses) Earnings2011 Compared to 2010Equity in losses of $13 million in 2011 decreased by $5 million from equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 and 31Table of Contentsprimarily reflected $9 million of increased earnings at two North American Limited Service joint ventures and one International segment joint venture, primarily due to stronger property level performance; $8 million of lower losses for a residential and fractional project joint venture (our former Timeshare segment stopped recognizing their share of the joint ventures losses as their investment, including loans due from the joint venture, was reduced to zero in 2010); and a favorable variance from joint venture impairment charges in 2010 of $5 million associated with our North American Limited Service segment. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $8 million of decreased earnings at two Luxury segment joint ventures. Furthermore, in 2011 and 2010 we reversed $3 million and $11 million, respectively of the $27 million funding liability we initially recorded in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption of our 2009 Income Statement (see Footnote No. 18, "Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges" of the Notes to our Financial Statements of this 10 K for additional information). The $11 million reversal in 2010 and the $3 million reversal in 2011 were both recorded based on facts and circumstances surrounding a project related to our former Timeshare segment, including continued progress on certain construction related legal claims and potential funding of certain costs by one of the partners. 2010 Compared to 2009Equity in losses of $18 million in 2010 decreased by $48 million from equity in losses of $66 million in 2009 and primarily reflected favorable variances from a $30 million impairment charge associated with a Luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined was fully impaired and a $3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that we did not allocate to one of our segments, both incurred in 2009. In the 2010 fourth quarter we also recorded an $11 million reversal of the $27 million funding liability initially recorded in 2009 (see preceding "2011 Compared to 2010" discussion). Increased earnings of $5 million for our International segment joint ventures and $3 million of lower cancellation reserves at our former Timeshare segment joint venture also contributed to the decrease in equity in losses. A 2010 impairment charge of $5 million associated with our North American Limited Service segment joint venture partially offset the favorable impacts.Net Losses Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests2010 Compared to 2009Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $7 million in 2010 to zero, compared to $7 million in 2009. The benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of $7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners share of losses totaling $11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate, net of our partners share of tax benefits of $4 million associated with the losses.Net Income (Loss)2011 Compared to 2010Net income and net income attributable to Marriott decreased by $260 million (57 percent) to $198 million in 2011 from $458 million in 2010, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Marriott decreased by $0.66 per share (55 percent) to $0.55 per share from $1.21 per share in 2010. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss), the $260 million decrease in net income compared to the prior year was due to Timeshare strategy impairment charges ($324 million), higher income taxes ($65 million), lower gains and other income ($42 million), lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($40 million), and lower interest income ($5 million). Higher base management and franchise fees ($105 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($49 million), lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($28 million), lower interest expense ($16 million), higher incentive management fees ($13 million), and lower equity in losses ($5 million) partially offset these items.2010 Compared to 2009Net income of $458 million in 2010 increased by $811 million (230 percent) from a loss of $353 million in 2009, net income attributable to Marriott of $458 million in 2010 increased by $804 million (232 percent) from a loss of $346 million in 2009, and diluted income per share attributable to Marriott of $1.21 per share increased by $2.18 (225 percent) from losses of $0.97 per share in 2009. As discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss), the $458 million increase in net income compared to the prior year was due to a favorable variance related to Timeshare strategy impairment charges in 2009 ($752 million), higher Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses ($116 million), lower restructuring costs ($51 million), higher base management and franchise fees ($73 million), lower equity in losses ($48 million), higher incentive management fees ($28 million), higher owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses ($23 million), and higher gains and other income ($4 million). These favorable variances were partially offset by higher income taxes ($158 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($58 million), higher interest expense ($62 million), and lower interest income ($6 million).32Table of ContentsEarnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA, a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a companys capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.We also evaluate Adjusted EBITDA, another non GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects: (1) Timeshare Spin off Adjustments ("Timeshare Spin off Adjustments") as if the spin off had occurred on the first day of 2010. The Timeshare Spin off Adjustments remove the results of our former Timeshare segment for 2011 and 2010, remove unallocated spin off transaction costs of $34 million we incurred in 2011, and assume payment by MVW to us of estimated license fees of $60 million for 2011 and $64 million for 2010. We have also included certain corporate items not previously allocated to our former Timeshare segment in the Timeshare spin off adjustments. For additional information on the nature of the Timeshare Spin off Adjustments, see the Form 8 K we filed with the SEC on November 21, 2011 upon completion of the spin off; (2) an adjustment for $28 million of other charges for 2011 consisting of an $18 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of marketable securities; a $5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both related to one Luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy; and (3) an adjustment for $98 million of other charges for 2010 consisting of an $84 million impairment charge related to a capitalized revenue management software asset and a $14 million impairment charge related to a land parcel.We discuss the second and third of these items in greater detail in the preceding "(Losses) Gains and Other Income (Expense)" caption and the "2010 Compared to 2009" heading under the "Operating Income (Loss)" caption, respectively. We evaluate Adjusted EBITDA to make period over period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Both of these non GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting EBITDAs and Adjusted EBITDAs usefulness as comparative measures. We provide Adjusted EBITDA for illustrative and informational purposes only and this measure is not necessarily indicative of and does not purport to represent what our operating results would have been had the spin off occurred on the first day of 2010. This information also does not reflect certain financial and operating benefits we expect to realize as a result of the spin off.We show our 2011 and 2010 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations and reconcile those measures with Net Income in the following tables. 33Table of Contents($ in millions)As Reported 2011 Timeshare Spin off Adjustments Other Charges 2011 Adjusted EBITDANet Income$198 $260 $17 Interest expense164 (29) Tax provision (benefit)158 40 11 Depreciation and amortization168 (28) Less: Depreciation reimbursed by third party owners(15) Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures18 Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures30 EBITDA$721 $243 $28 $992 ($ in millions)As Reported 2010 Timeshare Spin off Adjustments Other Charges 2010 Adjusted EBITDANet Income (Loss)$458 $(47) $(25) Interest expense180 (43) Tax provision (benefit)93 (29) 123 Depreciation and amortization178 (35) Less: Depreciation reimbursed by third party owners(11) Interest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures19 (3) Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures27 EBITDA$944 $(157) $98 $885 Business SegmentsWe are a diversified hospitality company with operations in four business segments: North American Full Service Lodging, North American Limited Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. See Footnote No. 16, Business Segments, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment, the reclassification of certain 2010 and 2009 segment revenues, segment financial results, and segment assets to reflect our movement of Hawaii to our North American segments from our International segment, and other information about each segment, including revenues, net income (loss) attributable to Marriott, net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees, assets, and capital expenditures. In addition to the segments noted previously, on November 21, 2011 we spun off our timeshare operations and timeshare development business as a new independent company, MVW, which was formerly our Timeshare segment. See Footnote No. 16, Business Segments, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for historical financial results of our former Timeshare segment and Footnote No. 17, "Spin off" of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information on the spin off.34Table of ContentsAt year end 2011, we operated, franchised, and licensed the following properties (excluding 2,166 corporate housing rental units associated with our ExecuStay brand): Total Lodging and Timeshare Products Properties Rooms U.S. Non U.S. Total U.S. Non U.S. TotalNorth American Full Service Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts322 14 336 127,826 5,244 133,070Marriott Conference Centers10 10 2,915 2,915JW Marriott21 1 22 12,140 221 12,361Renaissance Hotels78 2 80 28,880 790 29,670Renaissance ClubSport2 2 349 349Autograph Collection17 17 5,207 5,207 450 17 467 177,317 6,255 183,572North American Limited Service Lodging Segment (1) Courtyard805 17 822 113,413 2,929 116,342Fairfield Inn & Suites667 11 678 60,392 1,234 61,626SpringHill Suites285 2 287 33,466 299 33,765Residence Inn597 17 614 72,076 2,450 74,526TownePlace Suites200 1 201 20,048 105 20,153 2,554 48 2,602 299,395 7,017 306,412International Lodging Segment (1) Marriott Hotels & Resorts 156 156 45,784 45,784JW Marriott 31 31 11,465 11,465Renaissance Hotels 72 72 22,947 22,947Autograph Collection 5 5 548 548Courtyard 91 91 18,377 18,377Fairfield Inn & Suites 2 2 334 334Residence Inn 3 3 341 341Marriott Executive Apartments 23 23 3,700 3,700 383 383 103,496 103,496Luxury Lodging Segment The Ritz Carlton39 39 78 11,587 11,996 23,583Bulgari Hotels & Resorts 2 2 117 117EDITION 1 1 78 78The Ritz Carlton Residential(2)29 3 32 3,509 329 3,838The Ritz Carlton Serviced Apartments 4 4 579 579 68 49 117 15,096 13,099 28,195Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Autograph Collection 5 5 350 350AC Hotels by Marriott 80 80 8,371 8,371 85 85 8,721 8,721 Timeshare (3)50 14 64 10,496 2,304 12,800 Total3,122 596 3,718 502,304 140,892 643,196 (1)North American includes properties located in the United States and Canada.

These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. During that time we also added four residential properties (753 units) and no residential properties exited the system. These property additions include 80 hotels (8,371 rooms) which are operated or franchised as part of our unconsolidated joint venture with AC Hoteles, S.A. See Footnote No. 8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, for additional information about AC Hotels by Marriott.Total segment financial results decreased by $218 million (22 percent) to $765 million in 2011 from $983 million in 2010, and total segment revenues increased by $586 million to $12,197 million in 2011, a 5 percent increase from revenues of $11,611 million in 2010.The year over year increase in revenues included a $604 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income. Total segment financial results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $324 million of Timeshare strategy impairment charges, a decrease of $40 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, a $24 million decrease in gains and other income, and a $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors were: a $101 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,104 million in 2011 from $1,003 million in 2010, an increase of $37 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $13 million of higher incentive management fees to $195 million in 2011 from $182 million in 2010, $13 million of lower joint venture equity losses, and a $12 million decrease in interest expense. For more detailed information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss).The $101 million increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates. In 2011, 29 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 27 percent in 2010. In addition, in 2011, 67 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 65 percent in 2010.See Statistics below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2010, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2011 increased by 60 basis points and worldwide comparable company operated house profit per available room ("HP PAR") increased by 7.6 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, and the impact of tight cost controls in 2011 at properties in our system, partially offset by higher property level compensation. These same factors contributed to North American company operated house profit margins increasing by 70 basis points compared to 2010 and HP PAR at those same properties increased by 8.1 percent. International company operated house profit margins increased by 40 basis points and HP PAR at those properties increased by 6.7 percent reflecting increased demand and higher RevPAR in most locations and continued tight property level cost controls, partially offset by higher property level compensation and the effects of RevPAR declines in the Middle East.2010 Compared to 2009We added 154 properties (28,114 rooms) and 31 properties (6,072 rooms) exited the system in 2010. These figures do not include residential or ExecuStay units. We also added three residential properties (442 units) and one residential property (25 units) exited the system in 2010.Total segment financial results increased by $979 million to $983 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009, and total segment revenues increased by $780 million to $11,611 million in 2010, a 7 percent increase from revenues of $10,831 million in 2009.The year over year increase in revenues included a $557 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Marriott. The results, compared to 2009, reflected a favorable variance from $685 million of 2009 Timeshare strategy impairment charges, $614 million of which were reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges caption and $71 million of which were reported in the Timeshare strategy impairment charges (non operating) caption of our Income Statements, an increase of $116 million in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $19 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $73 million increase in base management and franchise fees to $1,003 million in 2010 from $930 million in 2009, a $48 million decrease in restructuring costs, $35 million of lower joint venture equity losses, $28 million of higher incentive management fees to $182 36Table of Contentsmillion in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, an increase of $21 million in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $21 million increase in gains and other income. These favorable variances were partially offset by $55 million of increased interest expense and an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest benefit. For more detailed information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with Operating Income (Loss).In 2010, 27 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 25 percent in 2009. In addition, in 2010, 65 percent of our incentive fees were derived from properties outside of the continental United States versus 67 percent in 2009.See Statistics below for detailed information on Systemwide RevPAR and Company operated RevPAR by segment, region, and brand.Compared to 2009, worldwide comparable company operated house profit margins in 2010 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company operated HP PAR increased by 6.4 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting the impact of tight cost controls in 2010 at properties in our system and increased demand, partially offset by decreased average daily rates. North American company operated house profit margins were nearly unchanged as compared to 2009 while HP PAR at those same properties increased by 3.8 percent reflecting increased demand and tight cost controls at properties, partially offset by decreased average daily rates and lower cancellation and attrition fees. International company operated house profit margins increased by 120 basis points and HP PAR at those properties increased by 10.6 percent reflecting increased demand and continued tight property level cost controls.Lodging Development We opened 206 properties, totaling 30,856 rooms, across our brands in 2011 and 30 properties (6,262 rooms) left the system, not including residential products or ExecuStay. We also added four residential properties (753 units) and no residential properties left the system. Highlights of the year included:Converting 34 properties (5,615 rooms), or 18 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to one of our brands including 13 properties joining our Autograph Collection brand. Seventeen of the properties converted were located in the United States;Becoming a partner in two new unconsolidated joint ventures formed for the operation, management and development of AC Hotels by Marriott, initially in Europe but eventually in other parts of the world. The hotels are managed by the joint ventures or franchised at the direction of the joint ventures. There were 80 AC Hotels by Marriott at year end 2011; Opening approximately 62 percent of all the new rooms outside the United States; andAdding 68 properties (8,379 rooms) to our North American Limited Service brands.We currently have over 110,000 hotel rooms under construction, awaiting conversion, or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 30,000 hotel rooms (gross) to our system in 2012.We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the Forward Looking Statements and Risks and Uncertainties captions earlier in this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources caption later in this report.37Table of ContentsStatistics The following tables show occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR for comparable properties, for each of the brands in our North American Full Service and North American Limited Service segments, for our International segment by region, and the principal brand in our Luxury segment, The Ritz Carlton. We have not presented statistics for company operated Fairfield Inn & Suites properties in these tables because the brand is predominantly franchised and we operate very few properties, so such information would not be meaningful (identified as nm in the tables that follow). Systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties, in addition to our owned, leased, and managed properties.The occupancy, average daily rate, and RevPAR statistics we use throughout this report for 2011 include the 52 weeks from January 1, 2011, through December 30, 2011, for 2010 include the 52 weeks from January 2, 2010, through December 31, 2010, and for 2009 include the 52 weeks from January 3, 2009, through January 1, 2010 (except in each case, for The Ritz Carlton brand properties and properties located outside of the United States, which for those properties includes the period from January 1 through December 31 for each year). 38Table of Contents Comparable Company OperatedNorth American Properties (1) Comparable SystemwideNorth American Properties (1) 2011 Change vs.2010 2011 Change vs.2010 Marriott Hotels & Resorts(2) Occupancy71.0% 0.8%pts. 68.2% 1.1%pts.

Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,862 million in 2011, compared to $4,587 million in 2010.2010 Compared to 2009In 2010, across our North American Full Service Lodging segment we added 20 properties (7,591 rooms) and 5 properties (1,541 rooms) left the system.In 2010, RevPAR for comparable company operated North American Full Service properties increased by 4.3 percent to $107.86, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.8 percentage points to 69.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.1 percent to $156.14.The $49 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, primarily reflected $22 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $10 million of higher incentive management fees, $8 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, and $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses.The $22 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased RevPAR and unit growth as well as franchise fees from new properties added to the Autograph Collection. The $10 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins.The $8 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to stronger results driven by higher RevPAR and property level margins.45Table of ContentsThe $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected favorable variances from an $8 million impairment charge related to the write off of contract acquisition costs for one property, a $7 million charge for a security deposit, both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009, and a $3 million reversal of a completion guarantee accrual because we satisfied the related guarantee release requirements in 2010. These favorable variances were partially offset by $7 million in net 2010 other cost increases, primarily reflecting incentive compensation, as well as a $4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge recorded in the 2010 fourth quarter because we expected that a management agreement associated with one property would be terminated early in 2011 in conjunction with a change in property ownership.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Full Service Lodging segment properties totaled $4,587 million in 2010, compared to $4,333 million in 2009.North American Limited Service Lodging includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn & Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay.

The $11 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected $5 million of increased earnings in 2011 associated with two joint ventures primarily reflecting stronger property level performance and a $5 million impairment charge recorded in 2010 associated with another joint venture.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,687 million in 2011, compared to $1,548 million in 2010.2010 Compared to 2009In 2010, across our North American Limited Service Lodging segment, we added 103 properties (12,341 rooms) and 15 properties (1,556 rooms) left the system.

The $2 million increase in incentive management fees was due to higher property level revenue and continued tight property level cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins.The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a net $31 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable due, in part, to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls, partially offset by a $14 million long lived asset impairment charge in 2010 and $9 million of other cost increases primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. See Footnote No. 7, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010.The $4 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected an impairment charge associated with one joint venture. The $2 million decrease in gains and other income reflected the lack of dividends from one joint venture due to a decline in available cash flow.The $4 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected lower revenue and property level margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our North American Limited Service Lodging segment properties totaled $1,548 million in 2010, compared to $1,419 million in 2009.47Table of ContentsInternational Lodging includes Marriott Hotels & Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Autograph Collection, Courtyard, AC Hotels by Marriott, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments located outside the United States and Canada.

The $8 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected new unit growth, favorable foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, higher net property level income resulting from higher property level revenue at several properties, partially offset by lower property level revenue at properties in the Middle East.

In 2011, we also added four residential products (753 units) and no residential products left the system.In 2011, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased by 8.5 percent to $205.04, occupancy increased by 1.2 percentage points to 66.9 percent, and average daily rates increased by 6.5 percent to $306.45.The $3 million decrease in segment results, compared to 2010, primarily reflected $20 million of increased general, administrative, and other expenses and $8 million of increased joint venture equity losses, partially offset by an $11 million increase in base management fees, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, and a $5 million increase in incentive management fees.The $20 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a $5 million accounts receivable reserve, both related to one property whose owner filed for bankruptcy in 2011, a $5 million reversal in 2010 of a completion guarantee accrual, and $4 million in other cost increases in 2011.The $8 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected decreased earnings at two joint ventures.The $11 million increase in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR growth associated with stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The $5 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher net property level income resulting from higher property level revenue and continued property level cost controls, new unit growth and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange rates.49Table of ContentsThe $8 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $12 million in increased branding fees associated with the sale of real estate by others, partially offset by a $4 million decline in income associated with our leased property in Japan, which experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,350 million in 2011, compared to $1,261 million in 2010.2010 Compared to 2009In 2010, across our Luxury Lodging segment we added three properties (763 rooms) and one property (349 rooms) left the segment becoming an Autograph Collection hotel. In 2010, we also added three residential products (441 units) and one product (25 units) left the system.Compared to 2009, RevPAR for comparable company operated luxury properties increased by 10.2 percent to $193.17, occupancy for these properties increased by 5.9 percentage points to 66.1 percent, and average daily rates increased by 0.4 percent to $292.11. While Luxury Lodging was particularly hurt by weak demand associated with the financial services industry and other corporate group business in 2009, that business improved in 2010.The $60 million increase in segment results, compared to 2009, reflected a $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses, $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses, $8 million of decreased general, administrative, and other expenses, a $7 million increase in base management fees, and a $3 million increase in incentive management fees.The $30 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a $30 million impairment charge recorded in 2009 associated with a joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired.The $12 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a $6 million favorable variance from improved operating performance at three properties, as well as $4 million of higher branding fees primarily from one property, and $2 million of termination fees net of property closing costs, all in 2010.The $8 million decrease in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $5 million reversal in 2010 of a completion guarantee accrual for which we satisfied the related requirements and a $4 million favorable variance from bad debt expense recorded in 2009 on an accounts receivable balance we deemed uncollectible, partially offset by $1 million in other net 2010 cost increases primarily reflecting incentive compensation.The $7 million increase in base management fees was largely driven by RevPAR growth associated with stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The $3 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected fees earned and due from one property in 2010 that were calculated based on prior periods results.Cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our Luxury Lodging segment properties totaled $1,261 million in 2010, compared to $1,143 million in 2009.50Table of ContentsTimeshare included Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz Carlton Destination Club and Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott brands worldwide, prior to the spin off.

Timeshare contract sales decreased in 2011 primarily as a result of 51Table of Contentsthe spin off of the timeshare business resulting in fewer periods of Timeshare segment activity reflected in the 2011 fiscal year, as compared to a full fiscal year in 2010, as well as difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions in 2010 and the start up impact of the shift from the sale of weeks based to points based products in the 2010 third quarter. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $19 million decrease in cancellation allowances that we recorded in 2010 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue, previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing.The $113 million decrease in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,438 million from $1,551 million primarily reflected a $133 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue and a $4 million decrease in base management fees, partially offset by a $24 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue which reflected the spin off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance prior to the spin off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue which primarily reflected the spin off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue which reflected the spin off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates.Segment results decreased by $343 million to segment losses of $217 million in 2011 from segment income of $126 million in 2010, and primarily reflected $324 million of Timeshare strategy impairment charges, $40 million of lower Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $17 million of lower gains and other income, and $4 million of lower base management fees, partially offset by $22 million of lower general, administrative, and other expense, $12 million of lower interest expense, and $8 million of lower joint venture equity losses.The $40 million decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $28 million of lower other revenue, net of expenses and $25 million of lower financing revenue, net of expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and $5 million of higher services revenue, net of expenses. The $28 million decrease in other revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected a $15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability in the prior year and, to a lesser extent the impact of the spin off in 2011 as well as lower resales revenue, net of expenses due to lower closings. The $25 million decrease in financing revenue, net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spin off as well as lower notes receivable balances. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net $12 million reserve in the prior year, partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spin off. Gains and other income decreased by $17 million and primarily reflected the sale of one property for a gain in 2010 and smaller gains on sales of property in 2011. Base management fees decreased by $4 million, primarily due to the spin off. General, administrative, and other expense decreased by $22 million primarily due to a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the disposition of a golf course and related assets as well as the impact of the spin off. For additional information on the impairment charge recorded in 2010, see Footnote No. 7, Property and Equipment, of the Notes to our Financial Statements.Joint venture equity losses decreased by $8 million and primarily reflected lower losses from a residential and fractional project joint venture for which the former Timeshare segment stopped recognizing their portion of the losses since their investment, including loans due from the joint venture, was reduced to zero in 2010.The $12 million decrease in interest expense was a result of the transfer of the outstanding debt obligations associated with securitized notes receivable to MVW in conjunction with the spin off, as well as lower outstanding debt obligations and lower interest rates.2010 Compared to 2009During the 2010 third quarter, we launched the points based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (the MVCD Program) in North America and the Caribbean. Under the MVCD Program, we sold beneficial interests in a domestic land trust. Based on the number of beneficial interests purchased, MVCD members received an annual allocation of Vacation Club Points to redeem for travel at numerous destinations. Although the rights and privileges, that existed at the launch of the new program for owners of weeks based intervals were unchanged, those owners also had the option of enrolling in the MVCD Program, which afforded them the opportunity to trade their weeks based intervals for Vacation Club Points usage each year, as well as to purchase additional product in increments of less than one week. Since the MVCD Program was a significant change from our prior approach to the timeshare business, marketing efforts initially focused on existing owners, to encourage participation and purchase of additional product.52Table of ContentsTimeshare segment contract sales, including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects, represent sales of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential ownership products before the adjustment for percentage of completion accounting. Timeshare segment contract sales increased by $20 million to $685 million in 2010 from $665 million in 2009 primarily reflecting a $28 million increase in residential contract sales and a $26 million increase in fractional contract sales, mostly offset by a $34 million decrease in timeshare contract sales. Sales of timeshare intervals were hurt by tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. Residential and fractional contract sales benefited from a net $63 million decrease in cancellation allowances we recorded in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing.The $107 million increase in Timeshare segment revenues to $1,551 million from $1,444 million in 2009 primarily reflected a $98 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, a $6 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, and a $3 million increase in base management fees. The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue, compared to 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income associated with the impact of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards and, to a lesser extent, higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancies and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily due to tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, and a $20 million increase in reserves (we began reserving for 100 percent of notes that were in default in addition to the reserve we recorded on notes not in default).Segment income of $126 million in 2010 increased by $800 million from $674 million of segment losses in 2009, and primarily reflected a favorable variance from the $685 million of impairments recorded in 2009, $116 million of higher 2010 Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses, $45 million of lower restructuring costs compared with 2009, $18 million increase in gains and other income, $3 million increase in base management fees, and $4 million of lower joint venture equity losses partially offset by a $55 million increase in interest expense, an $11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest, and $5 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.The $116 million increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected $78 million of higher financing revenue, net of expenses, $33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs, and $8 million of higher other revenue net of expense, partially offset by $3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses. Higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010, as well as favorable variances from both a $10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net $3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009, partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated previously. The $20 million unfavorable impact to development revenue related to the reserve for uncollectible accounts was partially offset by a favorable impact in product costs, resulting in a net $12 million increase in reserves.The $78 million increase in financing revenue, net of expense, primarily reflected: (1) a net $141 million increase in interest income, reflecting a $147 million increase from the notes receivable we consolidated in 2010 associated with past securitization transactions as part of our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in interest income related to non securitized notes receivable reflecting a lower outstanding balance; and (2) a favorable variance from a $20 million charge in 2009 related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests. These favorable variances were partially offset by $42 million of decreased residual interest accretion reflecting the elimination of residual interests as part of our 2010 adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, $37 million of gain on notes sold in 2009, and $3 million of other net expenses.The $8 million increase in other revenue net of expense primarily reflected a $15 million favorable adjustment to the Marriott Rewards liability resulting from lower than anticipated cost of redemptions, as well as $6 million of higher other miscellaneous revenue, partially offset by $13 million of net costs in excess of enrollment revenue related to the MVCD Program. The $11 million increase in services revenue net of expenses primarily reflected higher rental revenue associated with increased transient demand.The $55 million in interest expense was a result of the consolidation of debt obligations due to our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards.Gains and other income increased by $18 million, primarily due to the sale of one property in the 2010 fourth quarter.The $5 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected a $13 million impairment charge in 2010 associated with the anticipated disposition of a golf course and related assets. Partially offsetting this unfavorable variance was a $7 million write off of capitalized software development costs in 2009 related to a project for 53Table of Contentswhich we decided not to pursue further development. Joint venture equity losses decreased by $4 million and primarily reflected higher cancellation allowances recorded at a joint venture in 2009.The $11 million decrease to zero in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interest was associated with our acquisition of that noncontrolling interest. SHARE BASED COMPENSATIONUnder our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our Class A Common Stock (Stock Option Program); (2) stock appreciation rights (SARs) for our Class A Common Stock (Stock Appreciation Right Program); (3) restricted stock units (RSUs) of our Class A Common Stock; and (4) deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that equal the market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.During 2011, we granted 2.6 million RSUs, 0.7 million Employee SARs, and 29,000 deferred stock units. See Footnote No. 3, Share Based Compensation, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSSee Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for information related to our adoption of new accounting standards in 2011 and for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.54Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements and Our Credit FacilitiesOn June 23, 2011, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility) to extend the facilitys expiration from May 14, 2012 to June 23, 2016 and reduce (at our direction) the facility size from $2.404 billion to $1.750 billion of aggregate effective borrowings. The material terms of the amended and restated Credit Facility are otherwise unchanged, and the facility continues to support general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. The availability of the Credit Facility also supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. For additional information on our Credit Facility, including participating financial institutions, see Exhibit 10, Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to our Current Report on Form 8 K filed with the SEC on June 27, 2011.The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4 to 1. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.We believe the Credit Facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remains adequate to meet our short term and long term liquidity requirements, finance our long term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.In early 2011 we resumed issuing commercial paper in the United States. We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our issuances are subject to market demand. We classify any outstanding commercial paper and Credit Facility borrowings as long term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. We reserve unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.At year end 2011, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1.520 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of $1.418 billion under our Credit Facility and our cash balance of $102 million. We calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $1.750 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our Credit Facility and subtracting $1 million of outstanding letters of credit under our Credit Facility and $331 million of outstanding commercial paper. We had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at year end 2011. We anticipate that available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations. Since we continue to have ample flexibility under the Credit Facilitys covenants, we also expect that undrawn bank commitments under the Credit Facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.Cash from OperationsCash from operations, depreciation expense, and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows:($ in millions)2011 2010 2009Cash from operations$1,089 $1,151 $868Depreciation expense127 138 151Amortization expense41 40 34 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 0.5 to 1.0 at year end 2011 and 1.4 to 1.0 at year end 2010. See Footnote No. 17, "Spin off" of the Notes to our Financial Statements for information on the spin off in 2011 and related decrease in current assets. We minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. We also have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital.Our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which are detailed in Exhibit 12 to 55Table of Contentsthis 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K, are as follows: Fiscal Years2011 2010 2009 2008 20072.3x 2.9x * 3.1x 4.3x * In 2009, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by approximately $364 million.Timeshare Cash FlowsWhile our former Timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow, year to year cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing. We included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments. We show the net operating activity from our former Timeshare segment prior to the spin off (which does not include income from our Timeshare segment) in the following table. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, new Timeshare segment mortgages totaled $214 million, $256 million, and $302 million, respectively, and collections totaled $273 million (which included collections on securitized notes of $187 million), $347 million (which included collections on securitized notes of $230 million), and $155 million, respectively.($ in millions)2011 2010 2009Timeshare segment development less than (in excess of) cost of sales$97 $15 $(4)Timeshare segment collections (net of new mortgages)59 91 (147)Note repurchases (81)Financially reportable sales less than closed sales3 58 29Note securitization gains (37)Note securitization proceeds 349Collection on retained interests in securitized notes and servicing fees 82Other cash inflows (outflows)12 52 (45)Net cash inflows from Timeshare segment activity$171 $216 $146For additional information on our timeshare note securitizations, including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes, see Footnote No. 11, Asset Securitizations, of the Notes to our Financial Statements. For additional information on the spin off, please see Footnote No. 17, "Spin off" of the Notes to our Financial Statements. We expect that the spin off will result in the realization through 2015 of approximately $400 million to $450 million of cash tax benefits to Marriott, including approximately $115 million to $125 million for the 2012 fiscal year, relating to the value of the timeshare business. For 2011, we realized approximately $80 million of these cash tax benefits. Investing Activities Cash FlowsCapital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital expenditures of $183 million in 2011, $307 million in 2010, and $147 million in 2009 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives. Timeshare segment development expenditures, which we included in Cash from Operations prior to the spin off, as noted in that section, were not reflected in these numbers. Capital expenditures in 2011 decreased primarily due to the purchase of two hotels in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2010 increased primarily due to the purchase of two hotel properties. We expect investment spending for the 2012 fiscal year will total approximately $550 million to $750 million, including $50 million to $100 million for maintenance capital spending. Investment spending will also include other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. Over time, we have sold lodging properties under development subject to long term management agreements. The ability of third party purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions. We expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business. These 56Table of Contentsinvestments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.Fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our Lodging segment because: (1) we own less than one percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of $20 million in 2011, $114 million in 2010, and $2 million in 2009.Loan Activity. From time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. Collections and sales for such loans, net of advances during 2011 and 2010, amounted to net loan collections of $84 million in 2011 and net loan advances of $6 million in 2010. At year end 2011, we had no senior loans and $382 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $84 million) outstanding, compared with no senior loans and $191 million in mezzanine and other loans (including a current portion of $7 million) outstanding at year end 2010. In 2011, our notes receivable balance associated with senior, mezzanine, and other loans increased by $191 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans. See the Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans caption in Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.Equity and Cost Method Investments. Cash outflows of $83 million in 2011, $29 million in 2010, and $28 million in 2009 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.Cash from Financing ActivitiesDebt. Debt decreased by $658 million in 2011, to $2,171 million at year end 2011 from $2,829 million at year end 2010, and reflected a $1,016 million decrease in non recourse debt associated with previously securitized notes which we transferred to MVW as part of the spin off, partially offset by a $331 million increase in commercial paper and other debt (which includes capital leases) increases of $27 million. Debt increased by $531 million in 2010, to $2,829 million at year end 2010 from $2,298 million at year end 2009, and reflected consolidation of debt with a balance at year end 2010 of $1,016 million, partially offset by decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility of $425 million and other net debt decreases of $60 million. Our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long term debt and reducing our working capital. At year end 2011, our long term debt had an average interest rate of 5.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 3.6 years. The ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total long term debt was 0.82 to 1.0 at year end 2011.See the Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities, caption within this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on our Credit Facility.During 2010, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, which had a balance outstanding at year end 2009 of $425 million.In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million.Share Repurchases. We purchased 43.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in 2011 at an average price of $32.79 per share, purchased 1.5 million shares in 2010 at an average price of $39.02 per share, and did not purchase any shares in 2009. As of year end 2011, 5.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations previously approved by our Board of Directors.

As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities.

See Footnote No. 2, Income Taxes, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of year end 2011:Guarantee Commitments Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration by Period($ in millions)TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 YearsTotal guarantees where we are the primary obligor$210 $56 $41 $49 $64Total guarantees where we are secondarily liable258 47 77 56 78Total guarantee commitments$468 $103 $118 $105 $142In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee in favor of lenders with an estimated aggregate total cost of $498 million (Canadian $508 million), and a $3 million carrying value for our associated liability as of year end 2011.

Since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method InvestmentsWe have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and or franchise services and receive fees. In some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally vary from 10 to 49 percent. For other information on these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see Footnote No. 22, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to our Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been selected, could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.Please see Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting policies, including our policies on:Marriott Rewards and The Ritz Carlton Rewards, our frequent guest rewards programs, including how members earn points, how we determine the fair value of our redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue related to these programs;Valuation of Goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;Valuation of Intangibles and Long Lived Assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long lived assets 59Table of Contentsand when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long lived assets;Valuation of Investments in Ventures, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments in ventures and when we record impairment losses on investments in ventures;Legal Contingencies, including information on how we account for legal contingencies;Income Taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities; andLoan Loss Reserves for Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans and, prior to the spin off date, for Loans to Timeshare Owners, including information on how we measure impairment on each of these types of loans.OTHER MATTERSInflationInflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, stock prices, currency exchange rates, and debt prices. We manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements. We do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how such exposure is managed in the future.We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable. Changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixed rate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt.We are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price related to our investment in a publicly traded company. Changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment. We account for our investments as available for sale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At year end 2011, our investments had a fair value of $50 million.We use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non U.S. operations hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At year end 2011, our Balance Sheet included a $2 million asset for currency exchange derivatives and a $9 million liability for an interest rate swap. Please see Footnote No. 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information associated with derivative instruments.60Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of year end 2011 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks: Maturities by Period($ in millions)2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 There after TotalCarryingAmount TotalFairValueAssets Maturities represent expected principal receipts, fair values represent assets.Fixed rate notes receivable$76 $48 $34 $23 $44 $57 $282 $279Average interest rate 3.45% Floating rate notes receivable$8 $1 $1 $ $ $90 $100 $54Average interest rate 4.84% Liabilities Maturities represent expected principal payments, fair values represent liabilities.Fixed rate debt$(354) $(406) $(7) $(315) $(629) $(396) $(2,107) $(1,886)Average interest rate 6.60% 61Table of Contents
