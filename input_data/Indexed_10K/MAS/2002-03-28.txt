ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute "forward looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including changes in general economic conditions, competitive market conditions and pricing pressures, relationships with key customers, industry consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and builders, shifts in distribution, the influence of e commerce and other factors discussed in the "Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. OVERVIEW The Company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. The Company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders and consumers. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in North America and Europe (including repair and remodeling and new construction), the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure, fluctuations in European currencies (primarily the euro and British pound), the importance of and the Companys relationships with home centers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 25 percent of the Companys sales in 2001) as distributors of home improvement and building products, and the Companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition. Historically, the Company has been able to largely offset cyclical declines in housing markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 10 The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing agreements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. The Company maintains investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds, which totaled $106 million and $322 million, respectively at December 31, 2001. The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. The investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period using information made available by fund managers and other assumptions. The investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and unrealized losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recorded as a component of shareholders equity, net of tax, in other comprehensive income. Future changes in market conditions, the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments. The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as acquired goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," annually and when events and circumstances occur that may indicate impairment, management evaluates the recoverability of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the associated projected undiscounted annual cash flows; management also considers business prospects, market trends and other economic factors in performing this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, there was no unrecorded impairment related to acquired goodwill or other intangible assets at December 31, 2001. If actual results or circumstances are less favorable than those forecasted by management, or if upon completion of the new impairment tests under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the Company identifies an impairment, a future charge may be required. SFAS No. 142 became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2002. Additional information regarding SFAS No. 142 is set forth in the "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" Note in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies, including the potential sale of certain operating assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2001. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded in the period such determination is made. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. 11 CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT Mergers and acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to Mascos long term growth after the initial transaction related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization. The important earnings benefit to Masco arises from subsequent growth of such companies, since incremental sales are not impacted by these expenses. In 2001, the Company completed the acquisitions of BSI Holdings, Inc., The Aran Group, Griffin Windows Limited, d Scan, Inc., Resources Conservation, Inc. and Milgard Manufacturing Incorporated. BSI Holdings, Inc. is a U.S. company headquartered in California and is a provider of installed insulation and other products in the United States and Canada. The Aran Group is a European manufacturer of assembled kitchen cabinets and is headquartered in Italy. Griffin Windows is located in the United Kingdom and is a manufacturer of vinyl windows. d Scan is located in Virginia and is a manufacturer of ready to assemble office furniture. Resources Conservation is located in Connecticut and is a manufacturer of energy and water saving showerheads and decorative trim products. Milgard Manufacturing is a manufacturer of windows and patio doors in the western United States and is headquartered in Washington. These acquisitions provide the Company with opportunities to broaden its product and service offerings and enter new markets, and contributed approximately $1 billion in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001. The aggregate net purchase price of these acquisitions was $1,657 million, including cash of $560 million, assumed debt of $312 million and Company capital stock of $785 million. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was approximately $1,472 million. Of this amount, approximately $280 million was allocated to other identifiable intangible assets including $220 million to registered trademarks that are not subject to amortization and approximately $60 million to other definite lived intangible assets. The remaining excess purchase price of approximately $1,192 million represented acquired goodwill. Of the acquired goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, the Company estimates that approximately $760 million will be deductible for income tax purposes. The results of these 2001 purchase acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Had these companies been acquired effective January 1, 2000, pro forma unaudited consolidated net sales and net income would have approximated $8,611 million and $218 million for 2001 and $8,512 million and $656 million for 2000, respectively. In addition to earnings from 2001 acquisitions already included in the statement of income, pro forma unaudited consolidated diluted earnings per common share would have increased by approximately $.03 and $.05 for 2001 and 2000, respectively, from these 2001 acquisitions. The "Acquisitions" Note in the Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth additional information regarding acquisitions. PLANNED DISPOSITION OF BUSINESSES In December 2000, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of several businesses that the Company believed were not core to its long term growth strategies. Management estimated the expected proceeds from these planned dispositions based on various analyses, including valuations by certain specialists. For certain of these businesses, the related carrying value exceeded expected proceeds. Accordingly, a non cash, pre tax charge of $90 million was recorded in December 2000 with adjustments to goodwill of $60 million and other long lived assets of $30 million. During 2001, the Company completed the sale of its Inrecon and American Metal Products businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $232 million, which approximated their combined book values. In addition, the Company continues to guarantee the value of 1.6 million shares of Company common stock at a stock price of $40 per share related to the Inrecon transaction. The liability for this guarantee is recorded in accrued liabilities and is marked to market each 12 reporting period. Inrecon was included in the Installation and Other Services segment, and American Metal Products was included in the Other Specialty Products segment. The Company originally anticipated the remaining dispositions to be substantially complete by the end of 2001; due to various factors, including the weakened economic environment and uncertainty in the financial markets, the disposition process is continuing. The Company continues to be committed to the planned disposition of businesses adopted in December 2000 and currently anticipates the disposition process to be substantially complete by the end of 2002. Net assets of businesses held for disposition were $130 million at December 31, 2001, an approximate $232 million reduction from December 31, 2000, related to dispositions completed in 2001. The carrying value of the net assets of businesses held for disposition as adjusted at December 31, 2000 continues to reflect the Companys estimate of the lower of cost or fair value of such assets at December 31, 2001. The sales and results of operations of these businesses are included in the Companys results of continuing operations through the date of disposition. These businesses contributed sales of $400 million and $600 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and operating profit of $5 million and $40 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively; the declines in sales and operating profit include the effect of dispositions completed in 2001. SECURITIES OF FURNISHINGS INTERNATIONAL INC. During 1996, the Company completed the sale of its home furnishings products segment to Furnishings International Inc. ("FII"). Proceeds to the Company from the sale totaled $1,050 million, consisting of cash of $708 million, junior debt securities and equity securities. The Companys aggregate investment in FII at December 31, 2000 was $553.7 million including securities and other short term advances. During 2001, the Company recorded $28.9 million of interest income from the 12% pay in kind junior debt securities of FII and loaned $10 million to FII in the form of an additional pay in kind senior note. The U.S. furniture industry was adversely affected by the ongoing economic weakness in its markets in 2001, by the bankruptcies of a number of major retailers and by import competition. In the third quarter 2001, management of FII advised the Company that it was pursuing the disposition of all of its businesses and that the expected consideration from the sale of such businesses would not be sufficient to pay amounts due to the Company in accordance with the terms of the junior debt securities. Accordingly, the Company reevaluated the carrying value of its securities of FII and, in the third quarter 2001, recorded a $460 million pre tax, non cash charge to write down this investment to its estimated fair value of approximately $133 million, which represents the approximate fair value of the consideration ultimately expected to be received from FII for the repayment of the indebtedness. The ultimate consideration has been estimated by the Company based on the Companys analysis of FIIs recent indicated plans to dispose of its businesses and other assets. Because the debt securities that the Company holds are subordinate to all other debt of FII, the net proceeds from the disposition of FII businesses and other assets, after repaying their bank debt of approximately $250 million at December 31, 2001, and satisfying retained liabilities, will determine the amount available to the Company. The amount of net proceeds has been estimated by FII management and reviewed by the Company based on actual sales proceeds as well as estimated values for the sale of its remaining businesses, including indications from ongoing negotiations with prospective buyers, as well as estimates for liquidation values for other assets and net liabilities to be retained by FII. In January 2002, the Company entered into a $30 million revolving credit arrangement with FII to assist FII with its temporary cash requirements incident to this disposition process. Upon completion of the dispositions, actual proceeds to the Company may differ from the Companys estimates, and may result in an adjustment to income or expense at that time. Management of FII expects the disposition process to be substantially complete by the end of 2002; however, due to 13 various factors, the disposition process and the determination of the consideration ultimately to be received by the Company may extend beyond the end of 2002. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations and long term bank debt and other borrowings, and by the issuance of common stock for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure availability of funds. The credit lines with banks syndicated in the United States at December 31, 2001 include a $1.25 billion 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement with a group of banks due and payable in November 2005 and a $1.0 billion 364 day Revolving Credit Agreement that expires in November 2002. Borrowings under the 5 year Credit Agreement approximated $191 million at December 31, 2001. There were no borrowings under the 364 day Credit Agreement at December 31, 2001. Interest is payable on borrowings under these agreements based on various floating rate options as selected by the Company (approximately 4.8 percent and 7.0 percent at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively). The Company also has notes payable to banks syndicated in Europe. At December 31, 2001, approximately $181 million of European bank debt related to a term loan facility expiring in July 2002, and approximately $189 million represented borrowings under lines of credit primarily expiring in 2003. Interest is payable on European borrowings based on various floating rates as selected by the Company (approximately 3.9 percent and 5.3 percent at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively). Certain debt agreements contain limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2001, the Company had additional borrowing capacity of up to $1.3 billion. Certain debt agreements also contain a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2001, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately $1 billion. In January 2002, the Company increased the amount of debt and equity securities issuable under its unallocated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which the Company is able to issue up to a combined $2 billion of debt and equity securities. During 2001, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend four percent to $.13 1/2 per share. This marks the 43rd consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Although the Company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years, the Company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the Company. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to 48 percent at December 31, 2001 from 49 percent at December 31, 2000. The Companys working capital ratio was 2.1 to 1 at both December 31, 2001 and 2000. 14 CASH FLOWS Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows: (IN THOUSANDS) 2001 2000 1999 Net cash from operating activities........ $966,640 $733,840 $ 490,610 Increase in debt, net..................... 201,630 702,010 578,990 Proceeds from disposition of: Businesses.............................. 232,090 MascoTech shares........................ 57,140 Issuance of Company common stock.......... 156,040 Acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired................................

(2,810) (57,420) 13,870 Cash increase (decrease)........ $142,560 $(61,350) $(322,370) The Companys cash and cash investments increased $142.6 million to $312.0 million at December 31, 2001, from $169.4 million at December 31, 2000. Net cash provided by operations of $966.6 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $269.5 million, $530.0 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys investments to estimated fair value and other non cash items. Excluding working capital of acquired companies at the time of acquisition, net working capital decreased by $37.4 million. Days sales in accounts receivable at December 31, 2001 approximated 2000 levels. The Company expects days sales in accounts receivable to increase modestly in 2002 due to an extension of payment terms for certain customers. Cash used for financing activities in 2001 was $157.5 million, and included $243.8 million for cash dividends paid, $67.0 million for the acquisition and retirement of Company common stock in open market transactions and $48.3 million for the acquisition of Company common stock for the Companys long term incentive award plan. At December 31, 2001, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to an additional 24.3 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. Offsetting these cash outflows were cash inflows of $201.6 million from a net increase in debt. In 2001, the Company issued $800 million of 6.75% notes due 2006; $500 million of 6% notes due 2004; and Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2031, resulting in gross proceeds of $750 million. Proceeds from these debt issuances aggregated $2,050 million and were used to retire $1,848.4 million principally of bank debt and other notes; the remaining proceeds of $201.6 million were used for general corporate purposes. The "Long Term Debt" Note in the Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth additional information related to the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2031. Cash used for investing activities was $666.6 million in 2001 and included $589.1 million for acquisitions (the "Acquisitions" Note in the Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth additional information regarding the non cash portion of acquisition costs), $274.4 million for capital expenditures, $32.4 million for the net purchases of marketable securities and other 15 investments and $2.8 million for other cash outflows. Cash provided by investing activities in 2001 included $232.1 million of proceeds from the disposition of businesses. The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing operations and increasing its productivity, in order to be a more efficient producer and to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2001 were $274.4 million, compared with $388.0 million for 2000 and $350.9 million for 1999; for 2002, capital expenditures, excluding those of any potential 2002 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $290 million. Capital expenditure levels in 2000 and 1999 were increased for additional facilities related to anticipated increased demand for certain existing products as well as for new products. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2001 totaled $269.5 million, compared with $215.9 million for 2000 and $163.4 million for 1999; for 2002, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2002 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $200 million. The decrease in expected depreciation and amortization expense for 2002 results from the implementation of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," whereby the Company will no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Amortization expense totaled $105.7 million, $70.4 million and $48.8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, including goodwill amortization of $93.2 million, $66.2 million and $45.4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, from future financial market activities and from proceeds from asset sales. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SALES AND OPERATIONS Net sales for 2001 were $8,358 million, representing an increase of 15 percent over 2000. Excluding results from acquisitions and divestitures, net sales were flat in 2001 compared with 2000. The Company continued to experience weak economic and business conditions in its markets in 2001 including a softness in sales of home improvement products in North America and Europe, customer inventory reduction programs, competitive market conditions and pricing pressures and, to a lesser extent, the continued effect of a strong U.S. dollar. Net sales for 2000 were $7,243 million, representing an increase of 15 percent over 1999. Excluding results from acquisitions and divestitures, net sales for 2000 increased 4 percent over 1999. Net sales in 2000 were negatively affected by a softening in sales of home improvement products in North America and Europe, customer inventory reduction programs and a stronger U.S. dollar. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2001 was 69.5 percent as compared with 67.7 percent for 2000 and 66.0 percent for 1999. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2001 reflects the under absorption of fixed overhead costs, in part related to the higher level of capital expenditures in recent years, competitive pricing pressures, plant shutdown costs and asset write downs, higher energy costs and a less favorable product mix. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in 2000 includes the under absorption of costs related to slower than anticipated internal sales growth and new product launches, higher energy costs and a less favorable product mix. Including amortization of acquired goodwill ($93.2 million, $66.2 million and $45.4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively), selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of 16 sales were 18.1 percent in 2001 compared with 17.8 percent in 2000 and 19.6 percent in 1999. Excluding amortization of acquired goodwill, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 17.0 percent in 2001 compared with 16.9 percent in 2000 and 18.9 percent in 1999. Despite higher levels of bad debt expense in 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2001 approximated 2000 levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 1999 include the influence of unusual expense principally related to transactions accounted for as poolings of interests. Excluding such unusual expense, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased modestly in 2000 as compared with 1999. Operating profit margin, after general corporate expense, was 12.4 percent in 2001, 13.2 percent in 2000 and 14.4 percent in 1999. General corporate expense was $96 million in 2001, as compared with $99 million in 2000 and $92 million in 1999. General corporate expense as a percent of sales decreased to 1.2 percent in 2001 from 1.4 percent in 2000 and 1.5 percent in 1999. Operating profit margin, before general corporate expense, was 13.6 percent in 2001 as compared with 14.6 percent in 2000 and 15.9 percent in 1999 (general corporate expense includes those expenses not specifically attributable to the Companys business segments). Operating profit margin, before general corporate expense, in 2000 was negatively influenced by a $90 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses. Operating profit margin, before general corporate expense, in 1999 was negatively influenced by unusual expense aggregating $156.7 million primarily related to transactions accounted for as poolings of interests. Excluding such charge and unusual expense from 2000 and 1999, respectively, operating profit margin, before general corporate expense, was 15.9 percent in 2000 and 18.4 percent in 1999. The Companys operating profit margin decreased in 2001 and 2000 due principally to the items discussed above and in the "Business Segment and Geographic Area Results" section. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET In 2001, the Company recorded an aggregate $530 million pre tax, non cash charge for the write down of certain investments, including $460 million for the securities of Furnishings International Inc. ("FII") held by the Company and $70 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of principally technology related marketable securities investments. Other interest income for 2001, 2000 and 1999 includes $28.9 million, $52.4 million and $46.6 million, respectively, from the 12% pay in kind junior debt securities of FII. In the third quarter 2001, as a result of the impairment of the Companys investment in FII, the Company discontinued recording interest income from FII. Other items, net in 2001 include $13.0 million of realized gains from sales of marketable securities, dividend income from marketable securities of $3.0 million and $4.7 million of income and gains, net regarding other investments. Other items, net in 2001 also include realized foreign currency exchange loss of $6.5 million and other miscellaneous expenses. During 2000, the Company recorded a $55 million pre tax, non cash charge, including $20 million for the write down of certain marketable securities and other investments and $35 million related to its investment in Emco Limited. During November 2000, the Company participated in a transaction in which an affiliate of Heartland Industrial Partners L.P. acquired a majority interest in MascoTech, Inc. In exchange for a portion of its ownership in MascoTech, the Company received proceeds aggregating $90 million, including cash and preferred stock of $57 million and $33 million, respectively. The Company recognized a $27.9 million pre tax gain from its participation in this transaction. Other items, net in 2000 include $1.3 million of realized losses from sales of marketable securities, dividend income from marketable securities of $2.9 million and $47.3 million of income and gains, net regarding other investments. Other items, 17 net in 2000 also include realized foreign currency exchange gains of $22.0 million, income from the early retirement of debentures of $19.0 million and other miscellaneous expenses. Other items, net in 1999 include $18.1 million of realized gains from sales of marketable securities, dividend income from marketable securities of $1.5 million and $10.5 million of income and gains, net regarding other investments. Other items, net in 1999 also include $7.6 million of dividend income from FIIs 13% cumulative preferred stock held by the Company and approximately $4.0 million of expenses related to the early retirement of debt. Interest expense was $239.3 million, $191.4 million and $120.4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively; the increase in interest expense pertains to borrowings primarily related to recent acquisitions. NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Net income for 2001 was $198.5 million as compared with $591.7 million for 2000 and $569.6 million for 1999. Diluted earnings per common share for 2001 were $.42 compared with $1.31 for 2000 and $1.28 for 1999. Net income for 2001 included a $344 million after tax ($530 million pre tax), non cash charge for the write down of certain investments. Net income for 2000 was negatively affected by an aggregate $94 million after tax ($145 million pre tax), non cash charge for the planned disposition of businesses and the write down of certain investments. Net income and earnings per common share for 1999 were negatively affected by unusual expense, principally related to transactions accounted for as poolings of interests. The Companys effective tax rate was 34.0 percent in 2001 compared with 33.8 percent in 2000 and 37.0 percent in 1999; the decrease in 2000 was due principally to the increased utilization of a portion of the Companys capital loss carryforward benefit, continued lower taxes on foreign earnings and a lower tax rate on the gain from the sale of MascoTech shares. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 34.0 percent for 2002. OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY The Company believes that the economic recovery will be slow and gradual due to various economic factors, including a housing market that is already relatively strong, excess manufacturing capacity which may curb overall capital spending and lower liquidity levels for businesses and consumers. The Company anticipates that the expected gradual economic recovery, together with other factors, including the continuation of relatively low interest rates, the need to replenish inventories in the Companys distribution channels and lower energy costs, among other things, may have a positive impact on its business prospects. The Company continues to face challenges in the marketplace, including pricing pressures, shifts in distribution, customer consolidations and foreign competition. The Company is committed to improving future performance, and has implemented several cost containment, growth and profit improvement initiatives. Additionally, the Company is continuing to review all phases of its operations for potential improvements, and believes that these efforts, contributions from acquisitions, modestly improved economic conditions in the markets for the Companys products and the absence of certain plant start up costs should have a positive effect on results for the full year 2002. 18 BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, in millions.

(E) Included in determining operating profit for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was the reclassification of gains/ losses on the disposition of fixed assets from other income (expense), net. 19 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION Changes in net sales in the following segment and geographic area discussion exclude the influence of acquisitions and divestitures. CABINETS AND RELATED PRODUCTS Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased 1 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due to competitive pricing pressures to maintain market share in a flat new construction market, a reduction in sales of ready to assemble products to a certain customer, reduced renovation and remodeling activity and lost sales to certain retail customers who declared bankruptcy in 2000. Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased 3 percent in 2000 compared with 1999 due largely to higher unit sales volume of U.S. operations included in this segment. The increase in sales in 2000 was negatively affected by a softening of incoming orders in North America and Europe. This segment was also negatively influenced by a stronger U.S. dollar in 2001 and 2000, which affected the translation of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margin was 9.9 percent, 12.6 percent and 14.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In addition to the influence of pricing pressures, operating profit margin in 2001 was negatively influenced by plant shutdown costs, the under absorption of fixed costs, higher energy costs, increased bad debt expense and the lower results of European cabinet companies. Operating profit margin in 2001 also includes the effect of plant start up and system implementation costs related to a European cabinet company. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by the under absorption of costs associated with a new product launch, a $20 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses and higher energy costs. PLUMBING PRODUCTS Net sales of Plumbing Products decreased 5 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due principally to lower unit sales volume related to a weaker economy and customer inventory reduction programs, competitive pricing pressures and, to a lesser extent, a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales of Plumbing Products decreased 1 percent in 2000 compared with 1999 due largely to lower unit sales volume related to a softening of incoming orders in North America and Europe, a stronger U.S. dollar and customer inventory reduction programs. Operating profit margin was 13.7 percent, 15.3 percent and 21.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating profit margin in 2001 was negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures, the under absorption of fixed costs, the lower results of European companies, higher energy costs and product mix, including an increased percentage of lower margin faucet units. Recent initiatives including investments in new product and system development and the re pricing of certain of the Companys faucet units have also contributed to the decline in operating profit margin. The Company anticipates that, in total, these initiatives should increase operating profit in future periods. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $40 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses. The decline in operating profit margin in 2000 also included the influence of lower than anticipated sales volume, product mix, including an increased percentage of lower margin faucet units, competitive pricing pressures, and higher energy costs. INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased 10 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 and 23 percent in 2000 compared with 1999 due largely to broader geographic market penetration in the United States. As a result of integration activities related to a significant acquisition in 2001, geographic market penetration activities at existing operations were not as 20 significant in 2001. Operating profit margin was 14.4 percent, 14.3 percent and 15.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 4 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due largely to higher unit sales volume of paints and stains, offset in part by a reduction in decorative lock and hardware sales. Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 13 percent in 2000 compared with 1999 due largely to higher unit sales volume of paints and stains. Operating profit margin was 17.9 percent, 17.8 percent and 10.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating profit margin for 2001 includes the effect of certain asset write downs, continued plant start up and relocation costs and increased bad debt expense. Operating profit margin in 2000 included the effect of a $20 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses. Operating profit margin in 1999 included the negative influence of the previously mentioned unusual expense related to a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. Excluding such charge and unusual expense in 2000 and 1999, respectively, operating profit margin declined modestly in 2000 as compared with 1999; such decline was due primarily to plant start up costs and higher energy costs. OTHER SPECIALTY PRODUCTS Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased 8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due to continued economic weakness and inventory reduction programs with certain customers. Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased 7 percent in 2000 compared with 1999. A strong U.S. dollar in 2001 and 2000 had a negative effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margin was 15.5 percent, 14.1 percent and 17.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The favorable influence of recent acquisitions and divestitures more than offset asset write downs, the lower results of European operations and increased bad debt expense in 2001. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $10 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses and by the lower margins of existing European operations included in this segment. GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS DISCUSSION NORTH AMERICA North American net sales in 2001 increased 1 percent over 2000. Strength in sales of paints and stains and insulation installation sales in 2001 was almost entirely offset by weakness in sales for many of the Companys other North American product offerings. This weakness included the influence of a softened economy, customer inventory reduction programs, competitive market conditions and pricing pressures. North American net sales in 2000 increased 7 percent over 1999 due to higher unit sales volume of paints, stains and cabinets and higher sales of installed insulation. Operating profit margin was 14.2 percent, 15.4 percent and 16.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decline in operating profit margin in 2001 included the effect of the under absorption of fixed costs, competitive pricing pressures, product mix and higher energy costs. In addition, operating profit margin in 2001 was negatively influenced by plant shutdown charges and asset write downs as well as by increased bad debt expense. 21 Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $70 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses. Operating profit margin in 1999 was negatively affected by $156.7 million of unusual expense principally related to transactions accounted for as poolings of interests. Excluding such charge and unusual expense from 2000 and 1999, respectively, operating profit margin declined in 2000 to 16.5 percent from 19.6 percent in 1999. Such decline was due principally to the under absorption of costs related to slower than anticipated internal sales growth and new product launches, plant start up costs, higher energy costs and a less favorable product mix. Results of the Companys North American operations for 1999 benefited from demographic and economic conditions principally in the United States, including higher consumer confidence and income, modest economic growth and relatively low unemployment. These conditions favorably influenced the housing and home improvement markets in the United States, including housing starts, existing home sales and repair and remodeling activities. INTERNATIONAL, PRINCIPALLY EUROPE Net sales of the Companys International operations decreased 8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 and decreased 11 percent in 2000 compared with 1999. Operating profit margin was 10.0 percent, 11.2 percent and 12.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating profit margin for 2001 includes the effect of plant start up and system implementation costs. Although general economic conditions showed modest improvement in 2001 in certain European countries, the Company was negatively influenced by continued weakness in the new construction and repair and remodeling markets it serves. Operating results of existing European operations have been adversely influenced over the past several years, in part due to such weakness, competitive pricing pressures on certain products and the effect of a higher percentage of lower margin sales to total sales. In addition, a stronger U.S. dollar had a negative effect on the translation of European results in 2001 compared with 2000 as well as 2000 compared with 1999, lowering European net sales in 2001 and 2000 by approximately 4 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $20 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses; excluding such charge, operating profit margin was 12.7 percent in 2000. OTHER MATTERS COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. The "Other Commitments and Contingencies" Note in the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses certain specific claims pending against the Company and its subsidiary, Behr Process Corporation, with respect to several of Behrs exterior wood coating products. OTHER COMMITMENTS Metaldyne Corporation (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) holds an option expiring in October 2003 to require the Company to purchase up to $100 million aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities of Metaldyne. With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company, at December 31, 2001 under certain circumstances, has commitments to contribute additional capital to such funds of up to $138 million. 22 During 2000, approximately 300 of the Companys key employees purchased from the Company 8.4 million shares of Company common stock for cash totaling $156.0 million under an Executive Stock Purchase Program ("Program"). The stock was purchased at $18.50 per share, the approximate market price of the common stock at the time of purchase. Participants in the Program financed their purchases with five year full recourse personal loans, at a market interest rate, from a bank syndicate. Each participant is fully responsible at all times for repaying their bank loans when they become due and is personally responsible for 100 percent of any loss in the market value of the purchased stock. The Company has guaranteed repayment of the loans only in the event of a default by a participant, which aggregate amount was approximately $170 million at December 31, 2001. The Company believes that the likelihood of any significant default on these loans is remote. Certain recent purchase agreements provide for the payment of additional consideration in either cash or common stock, contingent upon whether certain conditions are met, including the operating performance of the acquired business and the price of the Companys common stock. Based on results through December 31, 2001, such additional contingent consideration could approximate $175 million. Common shares that are contingently issuable at December 31, 2001 have been included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for 2001. Additional cash consideration, totaling approximately $30 million, became payable during 2001 and has been recorded as additional acquired goodwill. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On January 1, 2001, SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" became effective. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires, among other things, that the purchase method of accounting for business combinations be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized and that such assets be tested for possible impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2002. The Company will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in SFAS No. 142. The Company expects to complete the first step by June 30, 2002. Any impairment that is required to be recognized upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 would be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company must complete the measurement of any impairment loss upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142 by December 31, 2002. The Company is in the process of implementing SFAS No. 142 and has not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company will no longer record amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include any component of an entity which comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity. The adoption of SFAS No. 144, which became effective January 1, 2002, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on Issue No. 01 9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer." EITF No. 01 9 requires that certain expenses, including cooperative advertising expense, that are currently 23 included in selling, general and administrative expenses, be recorded as a reduction of sales unless certain conditions are met. The adoption of EITF No. 01 9, which became effective January 1, 2002, may result in the reclassification of certain expenses within the Companys consolidated statement of income. Adoption of EITF No. 01 9 will have no impact on the Companys net income or earnings per share. Upon adoption, prior period amounts may be reclassified. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, "Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments." The Company had no significant holdings of derivative financial or commodity based instruments at December 31, 2001. A review of the Companys other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that the Company had exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company also had market price risk related to its marketable securities and other investments. At December 31, 2001, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess these risks and concluded that the effects of hypothetical changes of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments would not be expected to materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 24
