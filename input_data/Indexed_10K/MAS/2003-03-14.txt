ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute "forward looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including changes in general economic conditions and competitive market conditions; pricing pressures; relationships with key customers; industry consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and builders; shifts in distribution; the influence of e commerce; and other factors discussed in the "Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. OVERVIEW The Company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. The Company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders in the new construction market. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in North America and Europe (including repair and remodeling and new construction), the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure, fluctuations in European currencies (primarily the European euro and British pound), the importance of and the Companys relationships with home centers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 25 percent of the Companys sales in 2002) as distributors of home improvement and building products and the Companys ability to 10 maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition. Historically, the Company has been able to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. The Company maintains investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds, which aggregated $446 million, and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $448 million, at December 31, 2002. The investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period, or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions. The investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and unrealized losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recorded as a component of shareholders equity, net of tax, in other comprehensive income. The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. Future changes in market conditions, the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company completed the transitional goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing in 2002 and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $92.4 million, net of income tax credit of $24.4 million, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective January 1, 2002. See "Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change" for additional discussion 11 of the adoption of this standard. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company completed the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method. This test indicated that no additional impairment of such assets occurred in 2002. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Companys judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other information. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures and a three percent long term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. The Company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for individual business units were greater than the carrying values related to business units with goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill. In contrast, if the current estimate of future discounted cash flows had been 20 percent lower, the Company would have been required to recognize a pre tax impairment loss of approximately $43 million. Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for obligations. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. The Company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants, lawyers and actuaries. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the Companys consolidated financial statements in any given period. In 2002, the Company decreased its discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.5 percent, which reflects the decline in long term interest rates. The assumed asset return is 8.5 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. The plan assets were invested in equities (85 percent), bonds (8 percent) and cash (7 percent) at December 31, 2002. The Companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to $182 million from $59 million in 2001. This is the result of the change in the discount rate, plan amendments, asset returns below projections and the inclusion of the Furnishings International Inc. pension obligation of approximately $83 million at December 31, 2002 (see Note D to the consolidated financial statements). The plan assets in 2002 had a loss of approximately 15 percent as compared with declines of 17 percent and 23 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poors 500, respectively. The Company expects pension expense for its defined benefit plans to increase by approximately $10 million in 2003, principally as a result of lower asset returns. If the Company assumed that the future return on plan assets was 8 percent instead of 8.5 percent, the impact on pension expense for 2003 would be an increase of approximately $1 million. 12 The Company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies, including the potential sale of certain operating assets, in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2002. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the lifetime, under certain circumstances, of the original purchaser. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or service to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expected future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT Mergers and acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to Mascos growth. Generally, the earnings benefit to Masco arises from the subsequent growth of merged and acquired businesses, since incremental sales are not impacted by the initial transaction related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization. During 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of several home improvement products and service companies including Brasstech, Inc. and Bristan Ltd. (Plumbing Products segment), Cambrian Windows Ltd., Duraflex Ltd. and Premier Manufacturing Ltd. (Other Specialty Products segment), SCE Unlimited, IDI Group, Service Partners LLC and several relatively small installation service companies (Installation and Other Services segment), and Diversified Cabinet Distributors (Cabinets and Related Products segment). Brasstech, Inc. is a United States (U.S.) company headquartered in California and is a manufacturer of premium price point plumbing products, including faucets, plumbing specialties and bath accessories. Bristan Ltd. is a provider of kitchen and bath faucets and shower and bath accessories. Cambrian Windows Ltd. is a fabricator of vinyl window frames and Duraflex Ltd. is an extruder of vinyl frame components for windows, doors and sunrooms. Premier Manufacturing Ltd. is a fabricator of vinyl window and door frames. Bristan Ltd., Cambrian Windows Ltd., Duraflex Ltd. and Premier Manufacturing Ltd. are headquartered in the United Kingdom. SCE Unlimited is an installer of a broad variety of products and is located in the U.S., and IDI Group is an installer of insulation and other building products and is also located in the U.S. Diversified Cabinet Distributors is a distributor and installer of cabinets and countertops and is located in the U.S. Service Partners is a distributor and installer of insulation and other building products in the U.S. The Company also increased its ownership of Hansgrohe AG, a German manufacturer of kitchen and bath faucets, hand held and fixed showerheads, luxury shower systems and steam showers, from approximately 27 percent to 64 percent. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Hansgrohe AG have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded equity earnings from Hansgrohe 13 AG; the Company will begin consolidating the majority interest in the operating results of Hansgrohe AG in 2003. These acquisitions provide the Company with opportunities to broaden its product and service offerings and enter new markets, and contributed approximately $370 million in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002. The aggregate net purchase price of these 2002 acquisitions was approximately $1.2 billion, including cash of $699 million, assumed debt of $81 million and Company common stock valued at $399 million. At December 31, 2002, Hansgrohe AG had $45 million of bank and other debt. The excess of net purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was approximately $1 billion. Of this amount, $42 million, based primarily on independent appraisals, was allocated to other identifiable intangible assets including $19 million to registered trademarks that are not subject to amortization and approximately $23 million to other definite lived intangible assets. The remaining excess purchase price of approximately $1 billion represented acquired goodwill. Of the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, the Company estimates that approximately $270 million will be deductible for income tax purposes. The results of these 2002 acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Had these companies been acquired effective January 1, 2001, pro forma unaudited consolidated net sales and net income would have approximated $10.3 billion and $636 million for 2002 and $9.4 billion and $259 million for 2001, respectively. In addition to earnings from 2002 acquisitions already included in the consolidated statements of income, pro forma unaudited consolidated diluted earnings per common share would have increased by approximately $.06 and $.11 for 2002 and 2001, respectively, from these 2002 acquisitions. See Note B to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. PLANNED DISPOSITION OF BUSINESSES In December 2000, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of several businesses that the Company believed were not core to its long term growth strategies. Management estimated the expected proceeds from these planned dispositions based on various analyses, including valuations by certain specialists. For certain of these businesses, the related carrying value exceeded expected proceeds. Accordingly, a non cash, pre tax charge of $90 million was recorded in December 2000 with adjustments to goodwill of $60 million and other long lived assets of $30 million. During 2002, the Company completed the sale of its StarMark Cabinetry, Inc. business for cash proceeds of approximately $15 million, which approximated book value. During 2001, the Company completed the sale of its Inrecon and American Metal Products businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $232 million, which approximated their combined book values. In addition, the Company continues to guarantee the value of 1.6 million shares of Company common stock at a stock price of $40 per share related to the Inrecon transaction (through June 2004). The liability for this guarantee, which approximated $30 million at both December 31, 2002 and 2001, has been recorded in accrued liabilities and is marked to market each reporting period. StarMark was included in the Cabinets and Related Products segment, Inrecon was included in the Installation and Other Services segment and American Metal Products was included in the Other Specialty Products segment. The Company anticipated the remaining dispositions to be substantially completed by the end of 2002. However, due to various factors, including the weakened economic environment and uncertainty in the financial markets, the remaining businesses are no longer held for sale. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recognized a pre tax gain of $15.6 million related to certain long lived assets which were written down in December 2000 as part of the Companys plan for disposition. The gain resulted from an adjustment of the assets to the lower 14 of original carrying value or current market value, principally based on a change in the relationship with a major customer for one of the businesses. The sales and results of operations of the businesses sold in 2002 and 2001 are included in the Companys results of continuing operations through the date of disposition. These businesses contributed sales of $11 million, $237 million and $301 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and operating (loss) profit of $(.4) million, $13 million and $(8) million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; the changes in sales and operating (loss) profit include the effect of dispositions completed in 2002 and 2001. SECURITIES OF FURNISHINGS INTERNATIONAL INC. During 1996, the Company completed the sale of its home furnishings products segment to Furnishings International Inc. ("FII"). Proceeds to the Company from the sale totaled $1,050 million, consisting of cash of $708 million, junior debt securities and equity securities. The Companys aggregate investment in FII at December 31, 2000 was $553.7 million including securities and other short term advances. During 2001, the Company recorded $28.9 million of interest income from the 12% pay in kind junior debt securities of FII and loaned $10 million to FII in the form of an additional pay in kind senior note. The U.S. furniture industry was adversely affected by the ongoing economic weakness in its markets in 2001, by the bankruptcies of a number of major retailers and by increased import competition. In the third quarter of 2001, management of FII advised the Company that it was pursuing the disposition of all of its businesses and that the expected consideration from the sale of such businesses would not be sufficient to pay amounts due to the Company in accordance with the terms of the junior debt securities. Accordingly, the Company reevaluated the carrying value of its securities of FII and, in the third quarter of 2001, recorded a $460 million pre tax, non cash charge to write down this investment to approximately $133 million, which represented the approximate fair value of the consideration ultimately expected to be received from FII for the repayment of the indebtedness. During the second quarter of 2002, FII substantially completed the disposition of its operations. Certain non Masco shareholders of FII contributed their FII shares back to FII resulting in Masco becoming the majority shareholder. Accordingly, the remaining assets and liabilities of FII have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The fair value of the remaining net assets of FII represented proceeds for the Companys investment in securities of Furnishings International Inc. The remaining net assets were primarily comprised of notes receivable and other assets of $75 million, four million shares of Furniture Brands International common stock valued at $121 million (which was the market value at June 28, 2002), net of pension obligations of approximately $75 million and other accrued liabilities of $12 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations, long term bank debt and other borrowings, and by the issuance of Company common stock including for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds. The credit lines with banks syndicated in the United States at December 31, 2002 include a $1.25 billion Amended and Restated 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement due and payable in November 2005 and a $750 million 364 day Revolving Credit Agreement that expires in November 2003. These agreements allow for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros. The previous 364 day revolving credit agreement expired in November 2002 and was decreased from $1.0 billion to $750 million at the request of the Company based on its strong cash position and expected cash flows in 2003. There were no borrowings under either agreement at December 31, 2002. 15 Interest is payable on borrowings under these agreements based on various floating rate options as selected by the Company (approximately 2.4 percent during 2002). In 2001, the Company also had notes payable to banks syndicated in Europe. At December 31, 2001, approximately $181 million of European bank debt related to a term loan facility expiring in July 2002, and approximately $189 million represented borrowings under lines of credit primarily expiring in 2003. During 2002, these borrowings were repaid and the European credit facilities were terminated at the Companys request. Certain debt agreements contain limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2002, the Company had additional borrowing capacity of up to $1.8 billion. Certain debt agreements also contain a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2002, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately $1.6 billion. In December 2002, the Company replenished the amount of debt and equity securities issuable under its unallocated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which the Company is able to issue up to a combined $2 billion of debt and equity securities. In addition, the Company increased its shelf registration related to common stock that can be issued in connection with acquisitions to 50 million shares. The Company had cash and cash investments in excess of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2002 as a result of the strong cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings undertaken in 2002. The Company issued $1.4 billion of debt (net of issuance costs) in 2002 in order to take advantage of historically low long term interest rates. The proceeds were utilized to retire debt aggregating $804 million with the remainder used for general corporate purposes, including investments in marketable equity securities, bond funds and other investments. The Company has $700 million of debt coming due in the next 18 months and the Company believes that it has effectively, in part, prefunded these obligations at favorable interest rates. In addition, the holders of the Companys Zero Coupon Convertible Notes, at their option, can cause the Company to repurchase the notes for approximately $800 million in April 2004. During 2002, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend four percent to $.14 per share. This marks the 44th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Although the Company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years, the Company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the Company. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to 47 percent at December 31, 2002 from 49 percent at December 31, 2001. The Companys working capital ratio was 2.0 to 1 and 2.1 to 1 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 16 CASH FLOWS Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in thousands: 2002 2001 2000 Net cash from operating activities........ $1,224,850 $ 966,640 $ 733,840 Increase in debt, net..................... 634,410 201,630 702,010 Proceeds from disposition of: Businesses.............................. 20,920 232,090 MascoTech shares........................ 57,140 Issuance of Company common stock.......... 598,340 156,040 Acquisition of companies, net of cash acquired................................

Net cash provided by operations in 2002 of approximately $1.2 billion consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $220.3 million, a $146.8 million charge, net related to the litigation settlement, $92.4 million after tax charge related to the cumulative effect of accounting change, net, $24.1 million charge for the impairment of certain investments and other non cash items. Excluding working capital of acquired companies at the time of acquisition, net working capital increased by approximately $13 million. Days sales in accounts receivable at December 31, 2002 decreased modestly compared to 2001 levels and days sales in inventory decreased to 76 days at December 31, 2002 from 88 days at December 31, 2001, primarily due to the Companys working capital improvement initiatives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2002 was $767.4 million, and included cash outflows of $267.9 million for cash dividends paid, $166.2 million for the acquisition and retirement of Company common stock in open market transactions and $31.3 million for the acquisition of Company common stock for the Companys long term stock incentive award plan. Offsetting these cash outflows were cash inflows of $598.3 million from the issuance of Company common stock and $634.5 million from a net increase in debt. At December 31, 2002, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to an additional 48.3 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. In 2002, the Company issued $300 million of 4.625% notes due 2007; $850 million of 5.875% notes due 2012; and $300 million of 6.5% notes due 2032. Proceeds from these debt issuances, net of issuance costs, aggregated approximately $1.4 billion and were used to retire $803.7 million principally of bank debt and other notes; the remaining proceeds of $634.5 million were used for general corporate purposes and other investing activities. 17 Cash used for investing activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2002 and included $736.0 million for 2002 acquisitions (Note B to the consolidated financial statements sets forth additional information regarding the non cash portion of acquisition costs), $284.7 million for capital expenditures and $326.9 million for the net purchases of marketable equity securities, bond funds and other investments. Cash provided by investing activities in 2002 included $20.9 million of proceeds from the disposition of businesses and $30.5 million from other cash inflows. The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing operations and increasing its productivity, in order to be a more efficient producer and to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2002 were $284.7 million, compared with $274.4 million for 2001 and $388.0 million for 2000; for 2003, capital expenditures, excluding those of any potential 2003 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $300 million. Capital expenditure levels in 2000 were increased for additional facilities related to anticipated increased demand for certain existing products as well as for new products. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2002 totaled $220.3 million, compared with $269.5 million for 2001 and $215.9 million for 2000; for 2003, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2003 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $245 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for 2002 results from the implementation of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," whereby the Company is no longer amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Amortization expense totaled $38.7 million, $105.7 million and $70.4 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, including goodwill amortization of $93.2 million and $66.2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in non goodwill amortization expense is due to the amortization of definite lived intangible assets relating to recent acquisitions. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SALES AND OPERATIONS Net sales for 2002 were $9.4 billion, representing an increase of 14 percent over 2001. Excluding results from acquisitions and divestitures, net sales increased 8 percent compared with 2001. The increase in net sales in 2002 is principally due to relatively favorable economic and business conditions in certain of the Companys markets, which contributed to higher unit sales volume of certain products, particularly cabinets, architectural coatings, decorative hardware, vinyl windows and faucets. Net sales for 2001 were $8.3 billion, representing an increase of 15 percent over 2000. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, net sales were flat in 2001 compared with 2000. The Company continued to experience weak economic and business conditions in its markets in 2001 including a softness in sales of home improvement products in North America and Europe, customer inventory reduction programs, competitive market conditions and pricing pressures and, to a lesser extent, the continued effect of a strong U.S. dollar. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2002 was 68.5 percent as compared with 70.1 percent for 2001 and 68.3 percent for 2000. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 18 2002 reflects sales volume increases in all of the Companys business segments as well as the favorable influence of the Companys profit improvement initiatives. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the under absorption of fixed overhead costs, in part related to the higher level of capital expenditures in recent years, competitive pricing pressures, plant shutdown costs and asset write downs, higher energy costs and a less favorable product mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses before the charge for litigation settlement, net in 2002, and after general corporate expense and excluding amortization of acquired goodwill ($93.2 million and $66.2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively), as a percent of sales were 16.0 percent in 2002 compared with 16.2 percent in 2001 and 16.1 percent in 2000. Operating profit margins, before both the charge for litigation settlement, net and the income related to the planned disposition of businesses in 2002, the charge for the planned disposition of businesses in 2000, after general corporate expense and excluding goodwill amortization expense in 2001 and 2000, was 15.5 percent, 13.7 percent and 15.6 percent for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating profit margins, before both the charge for litigation settlement, net and the income related to the planned disposition of businesses in 2002, the charge for the planned disposition of businesses in 2000, before general corporate expense and excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 and 2000, was 16.6 percent, 14.8 percent and 16.9 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys operating profit margins decreased in 2001 due principally to the items discussed above and in the "Business Segment and Geographic Area Results" section. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET In 2002, the Company recorded a $24.1 million pre tax, non cash charge for the write down of certain investments, including private equity funds and other financial investments. Other items, net in 2002 include $38.3 million of realized losses, net from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $17.4 million and $.8 million of expenses, net regarding other investments. In addition, the Company incurred $13.8 million of losses related to interest ratelock transactions entered into in anticipation of the Company issuing fixed rate debt in the third quarter of 2002. Other items, net in 2002 also include realized foreign currency exchange losses of $4.2 million and other miscellaneous expenses. In 2001, the Company recorded an aggregate $530 million pre tax, non cash charge for the write down of certain investments, including $460 million for the securities of Furnishings International Inc. ("FII") held by the Company and $70 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of principally technology related marketable equity securities investments. Other interest income for 2001 and 2000 includes $28.9 million and $52.4 million, respectively, from the 12% pay in kind junior debt securities of FII. In the third quarter of 2001, as a result of the impairment of the Companys investment in FII, the Company discontinued recording interest income from FII. Other items, net in 2001 include $13.0 million of realized gains, net from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $7.8 million and $3.9 million of income, net regarding other investments. Other items, net in 2001 also include realized foreign currency exchange losses of $6.5 million and other miscellaneous expenses. During 2000, the Company recorded a $55 million pre tax, non cash charge, including $20 million for the write down of certain marketable equity securities and other investments and $35 million related to its investment in Emco Limited. During November 2000, the 19 Company participated in a transaction in which an affiliate of Heartland Industrial Partners L.P. acquired a majority interest in MascoTech, Inc. In exchange for a portion of its ownership in MascoTech, Inc. (subsequently renamed Metaldyne Corporation), the Company received proceeds aggregating $90 million, including cash and preferred stock of $57 million and $33 million, respectively. The Company recognized a $27.9 million pre tax gain from its participation in this transaction. Other items, net in 2000 include $1.3 million of realized losses, net from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $3.3 million and $47.0 million of income, net regarding other investments. Other items, net in 2000 also include realized foreign currency exchange gains of $22.0 million, income from the early retirement of debentures of $19.0 million and other miscellaneous expenses. Interest expense was $236.9 million, $239.3 million and $191.4 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Net income for 2002 was $589.7 million compared with $198.5 million for 2001 and $591.7 million for 2000. Diluted earnings per common share for 2002 were $1.15 compared with $.42 for 2001 and $1.31 for 2000. Net income in 2002 was negatively affected by a $92.3 million after tax charge for the litigation settlement ($166.0 million pre tax), net of an insurance recovery ($19.2 million pre tax) as well as a $92.4 million after tax ($116.8 million pre tax) non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first half of 2002. Net income for 2001 included a $344 million after tax ($530 million pre tax), non cash charge for the write down of certain investments. Net income for 2000 was negatively affected by an aggregate $94 million after tax ($145 million pre tax), non cash charge for the planned disposition of businesses and the write down of certain investments. The Companys effective tax rate on income before the cumulative effect of accounting change, net was 33.8 percent in 2002 compared with 34.0 percent in 2001 and 33.8 percent in 2000. The decrease in 2002 was due principally to continued lower taxes on foreign earnings. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 35 percent for 2003. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company adopted a new critical accounting policy regarding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements. The Company completed the two step transitional goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing in 2002. The first step of the test was to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that such assets were impaired. To the extent that an indication of impairment existed, the Company performed a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. The Company tested for impairment of its reporting units by comparing fair value of the reporting units to carrying value of the reporting units. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow method. This evaluation indicated that other indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired, however, goodwill recorded for certain of the Companys reporting units, principally in Europe, was impaired. Certain of the Companys European businesses have been affected by continued weak market and economic conditions. On adoption of SFAS No. 142, a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $92.4 million, net of income tax credit of $24.4 million, was recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, effective January 1, 2002. 20 OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY Given the unsettled world political situation and related uncertain economic environment, which could result in a possible downturn in housing starts, increased energy costs and a moderation in consumer spending, the Company is cautious about its business prospects for 2003. The Company expects that operating expenses will increase in 2003, particularly for such items as energy, insurance and pension costs. A major new product launch and certain other items and the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation programs due to the recent untimely passing of Mascos President, Raymond F. Kennedy will reduce earnings in the first quarter, seasonally the Companys lowest quarter of the year. The Company continues to face challenges in the marketplace, including pricing pressures, shifts in distribution, customer consolidations and foreign competition. The Company is committed to improving future performance, and has implemented a number of cost containment, growth and profit improvement initiatives. Additionally, the Company is continuing to review all phases of its operations for potential improvements, and believes that these efforts and contributions from acquisitions should have a positive effect on results for the full year 2003. 21 BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

Changes in operating profit margins in the following Segment and Geographic Area discussion exclude goodwill amortization expense and the charge for the litigation settlement, net. CABINETS AND RELATED PRODUCTS Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased 10 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to increased sales volume of cabinets largely through expansion of North American retail distribution channels at major home centers as well as new product introductions. Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products decreased 1 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 primarily due to competitive pricing pressures to maintain market share in a flat new construction market, a reduction in sales of ready to assemble products to a certain customer, reduced renovation and remodeling activity and lost sales to certain retail customers who declared bankruptcy in 2000. This segment was also negatively influenced by a stronger U.S. dollar in 2001 and 2000, which affected the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 13.5 percent, 10.5 percent and 13.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by increased unit sales volume, profit improvement initiatives and the reduction of both plant shutdown costs and other asset write downs, offset in part by costs related to a discontinued product line. In addition to the influence of pricing pressures, operating profit margins in 2001 were negatively influenced by plant shutdown costs, the under absorption of fixed costs, higher energy costs, increased bad debt expense and the lower results of European cabinet companies. Operating profit margins in 2001 also include the effect of plant start up and system implementation costs related to a European cabinet company. PLUMBING PRODUCTS Net sales of Plumbing Products increased 11 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the favorable influence of new product introductions, which contributed to higher unit sales volume of faucets to retailers in 2002 as well as increased growth in the wholesale distribution channels. The increase in sales of Plumbing Products in 2002 also includes the influence of inventory reduction programs of certain key customers in the first six months of 2001, which reduced sales in 2001 and favorably influenced the 2002 versus 2001 comparisons. Net sales of Plumbing Products decreased 5 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due principally to lower unit sales volume related to a weaker economy and customer inventory reduction programs, competitive pricing pressures and, to a lesser extent, a stronger U.S. dollar. Operating profit margins were 16.4 percent, 14.2 percent and 15.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2002 were favorably affected by the leveraging of fixed costs over increased unit sales volume as well as the Companys profit improvement initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2002 also include the favorable effect of a $15.6 million pre tax gain relating to the reclassification of certain assets to held and used in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Operating profit margins in 2001 were negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures, the lower results of European companies, higher energy costs and product mix, including an increased percentage of lower margin faucet units. Initiatives in 2001 including investments in new product and systems development, and the re pricing of certain of the Companys faucet units also contributed to the decline in 2001 operating profit margins. Operating profit margins in 2000 were negatively affected by 23 competitive pricing pressures, higher energy costs and the $40 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses. INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased 3 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 and 10 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase in net sales for this segment in 2002 was principally attributable to increases in sales of non insulation installed products which offset lower market pricing related to lower insulation material purchase costs. As a result of integration activities related to a significant acquisition in early 2001, geographic market penetration activities at existing operations were not as significant in 2001. Operating profit margins were 16.5 percent, 17.0 percent and 16.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 9 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due largely to higher unit sales volume of paints, stains and decorative hardware through North American retail distribution channels. Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 4 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due to higher unit sales volume of paints and stains, offset in part by a reduction in decorative lock and hardware sales. Operating profit margins were 21.1 percent, 19.2 percent and 19.1 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement in operating profit margins for this segment reflect the leveraging of fixed costs over higher unit sales volume, the absence of plant start up and relocation costs that contributed to lower operating margins in 2001 and lower levels of bad debt expense and certain asset write downs in 2002 compared with 2001. OTHER SPECIALTY PRODUCTS Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased 2 percent in 2002 compared with 2001, principally due to increased sales of vinyl windows. A weaker U.S. dollar also had a favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Net sales of Other Specialty Products decreased 8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due to continued economic weakness and inventory reduction programs with certain customers. A strong U.S. dollar in 2001 and 2000 had a negative effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 19.3 percent, 17.4 percent and 16.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement in operating profit margins in 2002 was positively influenced by recent acquisitions, which in the aggregate have higher operating profit margins than the segment average, as well as lower levels of bad debt expense and asset write downs in 2002 compared with 2001. The operating profit margins in 2001 were also negatively affected by the lower results of European operations. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $10 million charge for the planned disposition of businesses and by the lower margins of certain European operations included in this segment. GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS DISCUSSION NORTH AMERICA Net sales from North American operations increased 9 percent in 2002 over 2001, due to increased sales of certain products, including cabinets, architectural coatings, vinyl windows and faucets. North American net sales in 2001 increased 1 percent over 2000. Strength in sales of 24 paints and stains and insulation installation sales in 2001 was almost entirely offset by weakness in sales for many of the Companys other North American product offerings. This weakness included the influence of a softened economy, customer inventory reduction programs, competitive market conditions and pricing pressures. Operating profit margins were 17.3 percent, 15.4 percent and 16.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The improvement in operating profit margins for 2002 principally reflects the leveraging of fixed costs over increased sales volume, product mix and the influence of the Companys profit improvement initiatives. The decline in operating profit margins in 2001 included the effects of the under absorption of fixed costs, competitive pricing pressures, product mix and higher energy costs. In addition, operating profit margin in 2001 was negatively influenced by plant shutdown charges and asset write downs as well as by increased bad debt expense. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $70 million charge for the planned disposition of certain businesses. INTERNATIONAL, PRINCIPALLY EUROPE Net sales of the Companys International operations increased 5 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of European results in 2002 compared with 2001, increasing European net sales in 2002 by approximately 5 percent. International operations net sales decreased 8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. In 2001, a stronger U.S. dollar had a negative effect on the translation of European results, lowering European net sales by approximately 4 percent in 2001 compared with 2000. Operating profit margins were 13.6 percent, 11.9 percent and 13.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating profit margins for International operations for 2002 benefited from profit improvement initiatives as well as the positive influence of recent acquisitions, which in the aggregate have higher operating profit margins than the International operations average. Operating profit margins for 2001 include the effect of plant start up and system implementation costs. Operating results of certain European operations have been adversely influenced over the past several years, in part due to weakness in the European markets, competitive pricing pressures on certain products and the effect of a higher percentage of lower margin sales to total sales. Operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a $20 million charge for the planned disposition of certain businesses; excluding such charge, operating profit margin was 14.5 percent in 2000. OTHER MATTERS COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Note S to the consolidated financial statements discusses certain specific claims pending against the Company and its subsidiary, Behr Process Corporation, with respect to several exterior wood coating products previously manufactured by Behr. Other Commitments Metaldyne Corporation (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) held an option expiring in October 2003 to require the Company to purchase up to $100 million aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities of Metaldyne. During 2002, Metaldyne canceled this option. 25 With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company, at December 31, 2002, has under certain circumstances, commitments to contribute additional capital to such funds of up to $105 million. During 2000, approximately 300 of the Companys key employees purchased from the Company 8.4 million shares of Company common stock for cash totaling $156.0 million under an Executive Stock Purchase Program ("Program"). The stock was purchased at $18.50 per share, the approximate market price of the common stock at the time of purchase. Participants in the Program financed their purchases with five year full recourse personal loans, at a market interest rate, from a bank syndicate. Each participant is fully responsible at all times for repaying their bank loans when they become due and is personally responsible for 100 percent of any loss in the market value of the purchased stock except that in the event of death, if the participant is in a loss position, the participants estate may transfer the purchased stock to the Company and require the Company to assume responsibility for the loan. The Company has guaranteed repayment of the loans, for which the aggregate amount outstanding was approximately $170 million at December 31, 2002, in the event of a default by a participant. The Company believes that the likelihood of any significant defaults by participants on payment of these loans is remote. The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims against builders for issues relating to the Companys products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable. Guarantees On November 25, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This new interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to disclose (a) the nature of the guarantee, including the approximate term of the guarantee, how the guarantee arose, and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the guarantee; (b) the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee; (c) the carrying amount of the liability, if any, for the guarantors obligations under the guarantee; and (d) the nature and extent of any recourse provisions or available collateral that would enable the guarantor to recover the amounts paid under the guarantee. Regarding product warranties, FIN 45 specifies that instead of disclosing the maximum potential amount of future payments, companies should disclose the guarantors accounting policy and methodology used in determining their liability along with a tabular reconciliation of changes in the guarantors product warranty liability for the reporting period. Warranty Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the lifetime, under certain circumstances, of the original purchaser. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or service to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys 26 estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expected future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. See Note S to the consolidated financial statements for the tabular disclosure. A significant portion of the Companys business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Companys revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing income, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale. Acquisition Related Commitments The Company, as part of recent purchase agreements for certain companies acquired, provides for the payment of additional consideration in either cash or Company common stock, contingent upon whether certain conditions are met, including the operating performance of the acquired businesses and the price of the Companys common stock. Shares that are contingently issuable under these guarantees are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. See Note S to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As part of other recent acquisition agreements, the Company has additional consideration payable in cash of approximately $85 million contingent on the operating performance of the acquired businesses. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," became effective. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01 9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer," became effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2002. EITF No. 01 9 requires that certain expenses, including cooperative advertising expense and other customer related incentives, be recorded as a reduction of sales unless certain conditions are met. The adoption of EITF No. 01 9 resulted in the reclassification of $74 million and $65 million of cooperative advertising expense from selling expense to a reduction of sales for 2001 and 2000, respectively. This reclassification did not result in a change in net income or earnings per common share. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs from Exit or Disposal Activities," which requires, among other things, that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is effective for all exit or disposal activities subsequent to December 31, 2002, and is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" relating to a guarantors accounting for and disclosure of the issuance of certain types of guarantees. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes. FIN 45 also expands the 27 disclosure requirements for guarantees and product warranties. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for 2002 (see Note S to the consolidated financial statements); the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS No. 123," became effective. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. The Company has elected to change its method of accounting for stock based compensation and will implement SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," effective January 1, 2003, using the prospective method as defined by SFAS No. 148. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements." FIN 46 requires that a Company that has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that FIN 46 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, "Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments." The Company had no significant holdings of derivative financial or commodity based instruments at December 31, 2002. A review of the Companys other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that the Company had exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company also had market price risk related to its marketable equity securities, bond funds and other investments. At December 31, 2002, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess these risks and concluded that the effects of hypothetical changes of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments would not be expected to materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 28
