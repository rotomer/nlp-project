ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this Report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute "forward looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual 10 results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including changes in general economic conditions and competitive market conditions; pricing pressures; relationships with key customers; industry consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and builders; shifts in distribution; the influence of e commerce; and other factors discussed in the "Executive Level Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW The Company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. The Company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders in the new construction market. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in North America and Europe (including repair and remodeling and new construction), the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure, fluctuations in European currencies (primarily the European euro and Great Britain pound), the importance of and the Companys relationships with home centers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 22 percent of the Companys sales in 2003) as distributors of home improvement and building products and the Companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition. Historically, the Company has been able to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for 11 differences between estimates and actual experience. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. The Company maintains investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds, which aggregated $517 million, and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $332 million, at December 31, 2003. The investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period, or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions. The investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and unrealized losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recorded as a component of shareholders equity, net of tax effect, in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. Future changes in market conditions, the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method. This test indicated that goodwill related to certain European businesses was impaired. The Company recognized a non cash, pre tax impairment charge of $137 million ($113 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2003. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company also recognized a non cash impairment charge of $5 million related to a business unit in the United Kingdom, as discussed in Business Segment Results. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Companys judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other information. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures and generally a three percent long term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. The Company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its individual business units were greater than the carrying values related to business units with goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill. Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for 12 obligations. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. The Company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants, lawyers and actuaries. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the Companys consolidated financial statements in any given period. In 2003, the Company decreased its discount rate for obligations to 6.25 percent from 6.75 percent, which reflects the decline in long term interest rates. The assumed asset return is 8.5 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. The Companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to $137 million from $183 million in 2002. This is primarily the result of asset returns above projections and Company contributions. The plan assets in 2003 had a net gain of approximately 23 percent as compared with an increase of 21 percent for the largest 1,000 Plan Benchmark. The Companys projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded non qualified supplemental pension plans was $110 million for 2003 compared with $82 million for 2002. The Companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets for its foreign pension plans was $42 million for 2003 compared with $22 million for 2002. The Company expects pension expense for its defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately $7 million in 2004, principally due to higher asset returns achieved in 2003 compared with the projection. If the Company assumed that the future return on plan assets was 8 percent instead of 8.5 percent, the pension expense for 2004 would increase by approximately $2 million. The Company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies, including the potential sale of certain operating assets, in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2003, particularly related to its after tax capital loss carryforward of $62 million. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to lifetime, under certain circumstances, of the original purchaser. At the time of the sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims (including income taxes) with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. The Company used estimates for the number of claims expected and the average cost per claim to determine the liability related to the Behr litigation settlement in 2002. In 2003, the Company received a fraction of the claims originally estimated and reduced its accrual for litigation settlement by $58 million. 13 CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY Acquisitions over the last several years have enabled the Company to build a unique critical mass that has given the Company a strong position in the markets it serves and has increased the Companys importance to its customers. The Company is now intensifying its focus on leveraging the critical mass to build greater value for its shareholders. Going forward, the Company will have a more balanced growth strategy of internal growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital. As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses are core to continuing operations. The Company reviews its business portfolio on an ongoing basis as part of its corporate strategic planning and, in the first quarter of 2004, has determined that several European businesses are not core to the Companys long term growth strategy and, accordingly, has embarked on a plan of disposition. These businesses had combined 2003 net sales in excess of $350 million and an approximate net book value of $330 million. The Company expects net proceeds from the dispositions to exceed $300 million. The dispositions are expected to be completed within the next twelve months and the Company expects to recognize a modest net loss upon the disposition of all of these businesses. First quarter 2004 results will include a charge to reflect those businesses that are expected to be divested at a loss. Any gains resulting from the disposition of individual businesses will be recognized as such transactions are completed. During 2003, the Company acquired PowerShot Tool Company, Inc. (Other Specialty Products segment), and several relatively small installation service companies (Installation and Other Services segment). PowerShot Tool Company is a manufacturer of fastening products, including staple guns, glue guns, hammer tackers and riveting products, headquartered in New Jersey. The results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. The aggregate net purchase price of these acquisitions was $63 million, and included cash of $57 million and debt of $6 million. The Company also paid an additional $182 million of acquisition related consideration, including amounts to satisfy share price guarantees, contingent consideration and other purchase price adjustments, in 2003, relating to previously acquired companies. These acquisitions provide the Company with opportunities to broaden its product and service offerings and enter new markets, and contributed approximately $50 million in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. On September 30, 2003, the Company completed the sale of its Baldwin Hardware and Weiser Lock businesses. Baldwin and Weiser were included in the Decorative Architectural Products segment and manufacture a wide range of architectural and decorative products, including builders hardware and locksets. In a separate transaction on September 30, 2003, the Company also completed the sale of the Marvel Group. Marvel manufactures office workstations and machine stands, and was included in the Other Specialty Products segment. The sale of these businesses reflects the Companys continuing commitment to deploy the Companys assets in businesses that support its operating strategies and provide the greatest opportunities to create value for the Companys shareholders. Total proceeds from the sale of these companies were $289 million, including cash of $286 million and notes receivable of $3 million. The sales and results of operations of the businesses sold in 2003 are included in the Companys results from discontinued operations through the date of disposition. These businesses contributed net sales of $198 million, $271 million and $269 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and income (loss) before income taxes of $21 million, $29 million and $(4) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 14 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations, long term bank debt and other borrowings, and by the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds. The credit lines with banks syndicated in the United States at December 31, 2003 include a $1.25 billion Amended and Restated 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement due and payable in November 2005 and a $750 million 364 day Revolving Credit Agreement that expires in November 2004. These agreements allow for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros. The previous 364 day revolving credit agreement expired in November 2003. There were no borrowings under either agreement during 2003. Interest is payable on borrowings under these agreements based on various floating rate options as selected by the Company. Certain debt agreements contain limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2003, the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $2.5 billion. Certain debt agreements also contain a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2003, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately $2 billion. In December 2002, the Company replenished the amount of debt and equity securities issuable under its unallocated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which the Company is able to issue up to a combined $2 billion of debt and equity securities. In addition, the Company increased its shelf registration related to common stock that can be issued in connection with acquisitions to 50 million shares. The Company had cash and cash investments of $795 million at December 31, 2003 as a result of strong cash flows from operations and the disposition of certain businesses in 2003. During 2003, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend 14 percent to $.16 per common share. This marks the 45th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Although the Company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years, the Company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the Company. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to 43 percent at December 31, 2003 from 47 percent at December 31, 2002. The Companys working capital ratio was 1.8 to 1 and 2.0 to 1 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use derivatives for trading purposes. The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2003 consist of interest rate swaps entered into late in 2003, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt which is expected to reduce interest expense, given current interest rates. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations related to the United States dollar and the Great Britain pound. Generally, under interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swaps are considered a fair value hedge and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense or income over the term of the agreement. For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recorded in determining earnings. 15 The average variable interest rates are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a fixed adjustment factor. The average effective rate on the interest rate swaps is 2.25%. The interest rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of $850 million of the Companys fixed rate debt due July 15, 2012 at an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedge is considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the value of the hedge was recognized in the Companys statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003. The amount recognized as an adjustment (reduction) of interest expense was approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. CASH FLOWS Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions: 2003 2002 2001 Net cash from operating activities......................... $1,421 $1,225 $ 967 (Decrease) increase in debt, net...........................

Net cash provided by operations in 2003 of $1.4 billion consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $244 million, income of $72 million related to the litigation settlement, a $142 million charge (including $5 million recorded in the third quarter of 2003) related to goodwill impairment, a $19 million charge for the impairment of certain investments and other non cash items. Excluding working capital of acquired companies at the time of acquisition, net working capital decreased by approximately $36 million. The Company expects cash flows from operations to continue to increase due to improvements in inventory and working capital management as well as continuing strong business trends. Days sales in accounts receivable at December 31, 2003 were comparable to 2002 levels, days sales in inventory decreased to 47 days at December 31, 2003 from 56 days at December 31, 2002, and accounts payable days increased to 36 days at December 31, 2003 compared with 33 days at December 31, 2002, primarily due to the Companys working capital improvement initiatives. 16 Cash used for financing activities in 2003 was $1.6 billion, and included cash outflows of $286 million for cash dividends paid, $452 million for the retirement of notes (including interest expense and loss on early retirement), $779 million for the acquisition and retirement of Company common stock in open market transactions, $48 million for the acquisition of Company common stock for the Companys long term stock incentive award plan, $89 million principally for the net payment of other debt and $37 million from the issuance of Company common stock for the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2003, the Company had remaining Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to an additional 48 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. In January 2004, the Company repurchased an additional five million shares of Company common stock. Cash used for investing activities was $128 million in 2003 and included $271 million for capital expenditures, $239 million for acquisitions and additional acquisition related consideration relating to previously acquired companies and $32 million for other net cash outflows. Cash provided by investing activities in 2003 included $284 million of proceeds from the disposition of businesses, $55 million from the net sales of marketable equity securities, bond funds and other investments and $75 million from the sale of the equity investment in Emco. The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing operations and increasing its productivity, in order to be a more efficient producer and to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2003 were $271 million, compared with $285 million for 2002 and $274 million for 2001; for 2004, capital expenditures, excluding those of any potential 2004 acquisitions or divestitures, are expected to approximate $350 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2003 totaled $244 million, compared with $220 million for 2002 and $269 million for 2001; for 2004, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2004 acquisitions or divestitures, is expected to approximate $270 million. Amortization expense totaled $32 million, $39 million and $106 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, including goodwill amortization of $93 million in 2001. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States. However, the Company believes that certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non GAAP financial measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results. SALES AND OPERATIONS Net sales for 2003 were $10.9 billion, representing an increase of 20 percent over 2002. Excluding results from acquisitions and divestitures, net sales increased nine percent (including a two percent increase relating to the effect of currency translation) compared with 2002. 17 The increase in net sales in 2003 is principally due to higher unit sales volume of certain products, particularly assembled cabinets, architectural coatings, installation services, vinyl windows and faucets. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and divestitures, in millions: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2003 2002 Net sales, as reported...................................... $10,936 $ 9,149 Acquisitions........................................... (1,334) (320) Divestitures (A)....................................... (13) Net sales, excluding acquisitions and divestitures.......... 9,602 8,816 Currency translation................................... (228) Net sales, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency........................................ $ 9,374 $ 8,816 (A) Refers to divestitures completed prior to January 1, 2003. Divestitures completed subsequent to January 1, 2003 are considered discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Sales related to discontinued operations are not included in the Companys net sales, as reported, for any period presented. The Companys gross profit margins were 30.6 percent, 31.6 percent and 30.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decline in the 2003 gross profit margins reflects increased sales in segments with somewhat lower margins, relatively higher International sales (which have lower gross profit margins), new product launch costs as well as increased energy costs which impacted material, freight and other operating costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses excluding general corporate expense as a percent of sales were 15.9 percent in 2003 compared with 14.9 percent in both 2002 and 2001, with the 2003 increase reflecting increased advertising and promotion costs as well as increased insurance and pension costs. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 13.0 percent, 14.2 percent and 13.0 percent in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating profit margins excluding general corporate expense, the income/charge for litigation settlement (2003 and 2002), the goodwill impairment charge (2003), income related to the planned disposition of businesses (2002) and goodwill amortization expense (2001) were 14.7 percent, 16.7 percent and 15.4 percent in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The overall decline in the 2003 operating profit margins is primarily due to increased energy, insurance, pension, advertising and promotion costs as well as adjustments as discussed in the Business Segment Results related to certain United Kingdom business units. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $19 million and $24 million, respectively, of pre tax, non cash charges for the write down of certain private equity funds and other financial investments. Other, net in 2003 include $23 million of realized gains, net from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $25 million and $17 million of income, net regarding private equity funds. Other, net in 2003 also include a $5 million gain from the sale of the Companys equity investment in Emco, $7 million of losses on the early retirement of debt, realized foreign currency exchange losses of $5 million and other miscellaneous expenses. Other, net in 2002 include $39 million of realized losses, net from the sale of marketable equity securities and dividend income of $17 million. In addition, the Company incurred $14 million of losses related to interest ratelock transactions entered into in anticipation of the 18 Company issuing fixed rate debt in 2002. Other items, net in 2002 include realized foreign currency exchange losses of $4 million and other miscellaneous expenses. In 2001, the Company recorded an aggregate $530 million pre tax, non cash charge for the write down of certain investments, including $460 million for the securities of Furnishings International Inc. ("FII") held by the Company and $70 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of principally technology related marketable equity securities investments. Other interest income for 2001 includes $29 million from the 12% pay in kind junior debt securities of FII. Other, net in 2001 include $13 million of realized gains, net from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $8 million and $4 million of income, net regarding private equity funds. Other items, net in 2001 also include realized foreign currency exchange losses of $7 million and other miscellaneous expenses. Interest expense was $262 million, $237 million and $239 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2003 is primarily due to increased fixed rate borrowings in the last half of 2002. INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2003 were $740 million and $1.51 per common share. Income from continuing operations for 2003 includes a pre tax, non cash goodwill impairment charge of $142 million ($118 million or $.24 per common share, after tax). Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2002 were $664 million and $1.29 per common share. Income from continuing operations in 2002 was negatively affected by a $147 million pre tax charge for a litigation settlement ($92 million or $.18 per common share, after tax). Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2001 were $203 million and $.43 per common share. Income from continuing operations for 2001 included a $530 million pre tax ($344 million or $.72 per common share, after tax), non cash charge for the write down of certain investments. The Companys effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 38 percent in 2003 compared with 34 percent in 2002 and 33 percent in 2001. The increase in 2003 was due principally to a lower tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge as well as an increase in domestic earnings (relative to total earnings), which are taxed at a higher rate than earnings from the Companys foreign operations. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 36 percent for 2004. OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY Favorable sales performance has continued in early 2004 and, based on current business trends, the Company believes that it will achieve record sales and earnings for the full year 2004 from continuing operations, excluding any disposition charge. The Company expects certain operating expenses will continue to increase in 2004, including such items as energy, insurance and certain material and freight costs. The Company has embarked on a plan of disposition for several of its European businesses which are not core to the Companys long term growth strategy. The dispositions are expected to be completed within the next twelve months and the Company expects to recognize a modest net loss upon the disposition of all of these businesses. 19 BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

CABINETS AND RELATED PRODUCTS Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased 9 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to increased sales volume of assembled cabinets largely through North American retail distribution channels at major home centers and through the new construction market in the United States, as well as a more favorable product mix. Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased 9 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to increased sales volume of cabinets largely through expansion of North American retail distribution channels at major home centers as well as new product introductions. This segment was favorably influenced by a weaker U.S. dollar in 2003 and 2002, which affected the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 14.6 percent, 13.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2003 reflect the positive effect of higher sales volume as well as lower fixed costs resulting from the rationalization of existing manufacturing capacity. Operating profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by increased unit sales volume, profit improvement initiatives and the reduction of both plant shutdown costs and other asset write downs, offset in part by costs related to a discontinued product line. Operating profit margins in 2001 were negatively influenced by plant shutdown costs, the under absorption of fixed costs, higher energy costs, increased bad debt expense and the lower results of European operations. PLUMBING PRODUCTS Net sales of Plumbing Products increased 30 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to acquisitions (principally the acquisition of the majority interest in Hansgrohe in December 2002) as well as the effect of a weaker U.S. dollar which had a favorable impact on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Net sales of Plumbing Products increased 17 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the favorable influence of new product introductions, which contributed to higher unit sales volume of faucets to retailers in 2002 as well as increased growth in the wholesale distribution channels. The increase in sales of Plumbing Products in 2002 also includes the influence of inventory reduction programs of certain key customers in the first six months of 2001, which reduced sales in 2001 and favorably influenced the 2002 versus 2001 comparisons. Operating profit margins were 13.3 percent, 16.4 percent and 14.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2003 include the effect of a recently acquired company that has lower margins than the segment average as well as inventory adjustments and a decline in operating margins of certain European operations, including a non cash, pre tax charge of approximately $4 million relating to a United Kingdom business unit as discussed below. Operating profit margins in 2002 include the favorable effect of a $16 million pre tax gain relating to the reclassification of certain assets to held and used in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Operating profit margins in 2002 were favorably affected by the leveraging of fixed costs over increased unit sales volume as well as the Companys profit improvement initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2001 were negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures and the lower results of European companies. During 2003, the Company detected that an employee at a United Kingdom business unit in the Plumbing Products segment had circumvented internal controls and overstated operating 21 results by approximately $4 million in 2002. This overstatement was corrected in the third quarter of 2003. The Company made the appropriate personnel changes and completed its review of the business unit in the fourth quarter of 2003 and determined that no further adjustment was necessary. INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased 31 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 and 9 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase in net sales for this segment in 2003 and 2002 was principally attributable to acquisitions (principally the acquisition of Service Partners in September 2002) and a stronger new housing market as well as increased sales of non insulation products. Operating profit margins were 15.3 percent, 16.5 percent and 17.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decline in operating profit margins in 2003 is primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions (which reduced sales) experienced in the first half of 2003 as well as increased sales of generally lower margin non insulation products. DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 10 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increases in net sales in 2003 and 2002 are primarily due to higher unit sales volume of paints, stains and decorative hardware through North American retail distribution channels. Operating profit margins were 14.4 percent, 22.9 percent and 22.3 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were impacted by increased advertising costs, including additional costs associated with new in store paint display centers, and fixed asset and inventory adjustments reflecting excess, obsolete and resourced products related to decorative hardware. Operating profit margins for 2003 also include the effect of a non cash, pre tax charge of approximately $55 million related to a United Kingdom business unit discussed below. During 2003, the Company recorded a non cash, pre tax charge which reduced operating profit by approximately $35 million with respect to a United Kingdom business unit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment. The charge relates primarily to a business system implementation failure which allowed former management to circumvent internal controls and artificially inflate the units operating profit in years prior to 2003. The Company also determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a $5 million charge in the third quarter of 2003. Finally, the Company determined that the strategic plan for this business unit, relative to certain product offerings and customer focus, should be changed. This revision in operating strategy resulted in 2003 charges aggregating approximately $15 million principally related to inventories and receivables. The Company is implementing changes to its operational and financial structure in Europe which include: reorganizing its European business operations into product groups; the addition of group operating and financial personnel; training and evaluation related to internal controls; and the expansion of both external and internal audit involvement. OTHER SPECIALTY PRODUCTS Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased 16 percent in 2003 compared with 2002, principally due to acquisitions as well as increased sales of vinyl windows. Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased 42 percent in 2002 compared with 2001, principally due to acquisitions as well as increased sales of vinyl windows. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2003 also had a 22 favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 18.1 percent, 19.5 percent and 19.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The operating margin decline in this segment is primarily due to increased material and insurance costs as well as lower results of European operations. The improvement in operating profit margins in 2002 was primarily due to lower levels of bad debt expense and asset write downs in 2002 compared with 2001. The operating profit margins in 2001 were also negatively affected by the lower results of European operations. GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS DISCUSSION NORTH AMERICA Net sales from North American operations increased 14 percent in 2003 over 2002, primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased unit sales volume of assembled cabinets, installed sales of non insulation products, paints and stains, and vinyl windows. Net sales from North American operations increased 14 percent in 2002 over 2001, primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales of certain products, including cabinets, paints and stains, vinyl windows and faucets. Operating profit margins were 16.4 percent, 17.5 percent and 16.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decline in operating profit margins for 2003 principally reflects increased sales in segments that have somewhat lower operating profit margins, increased energy costs as well as increased advertising and promotion costs. The improvement in operating profit margins for 2002 principally reflects the leveraging of fixed costs over increased sales volume, product mix and the influence of the Companys profit improvement initiatives. INTERNATIONAL, PRINCIPALLY EUROPE Net sales of the Companys International operations increased 49 percent in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily due to acquisitions as well as a weaker U.S. dollar which had a favorable influence on the translation of International sales in 2003. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of European results in 2003 compared with 2002, increasing European net sales in 2003 by approximately 17 percent. Net sales of the Companys International operations increased 15 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to acquisitions as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating profit margins were 8.7 percent, 13.6 percent and 11.9 percent for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating profit margins for International operations for 2003 were adversely affected by the non cash, pre tax charges relating to accounting irregularities discussed previously, as well as lower margins of recently acquired companies. Operating profit margins for International operations for 2002 benefited from profit improvement initiatives. Operating profit margins for 2001 include the effect of plant start up and system implementation costs. 23 OTHER MATTERS COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Note T to the consolidated financial statements discusses the settlements in 2002 of claims pending in the United States against the Company and its subsidiary, Behr Process Corporation, with respect to several exterior wood coating products previously manufactured by Behr. Other Commitments With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company, at December 31, 2003, has, under certain circumstances, commitments to contribute additional capital to such funds of up to $88 million. During 2000, approximately 300 of the Companys key employees purchased from the Company 8.4 million shares of Company common stock for cash totaling $156 million under an Executive Stock Purchase Program ("Program"). The stock was purchased at $18.50 per share, the approximate market price of the common stock at the time of purchase. Participants in the Program financed their purchases with five year full recourse personal loans, at a market interest rate, from a bank syndicate. Each participant is fully responsible at all times for repaying their bank loans when they become due and is personally responsible for 100 percent of any loss in the market value of the purchased stock. The Company has guaranteed repayment of the loans, for which the aggregate amount outstanding was approximately $160 million at December 31, 2003, in the event of a default by a participant. The Company believes that the likelihood of any significant defaults by participants on payment of these loans is remote. The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims against builders for issues relating to the Companys products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable. Warranty Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the lifetime, under certain circumstances, of the original purchaser. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or service to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. See Note T to the consolidated financial statements for the tabular disclosure. A significant portion of the Companys business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other 24 types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Companys revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing income, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale. Acquisition Related Commitments The Company, as part of recent purchase agreements for certain companies acquired, provides for the payment of additional consideration in either cash or Company common stock, contingent upon whether certain conditions are met, including the operating performance of the acquired business and the price of the Companys common stock. Shares that are contingently issuable under these guarantees are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. See Note T to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As part of other recent acquisition agreements, the Company has additional consideration payable in cash of approximately $40 million contingent on the operating performance of the acquired businesses.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements." FIN 46 requires that a company that has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in the companys consolidated financial statements. The adoption of certain provisions of FIN 46, relating to variable interest entities formed prior to February 2003, has been extended to 2004. The Company believes that FIN 46 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." The revisions to SFAS No. 132 require enhanced disclosures regarding pensions and other postretirement benefits. Most of the enhanced disclosure requirements were effective for the year ended December 31, 2003; certain disclosure provisions are effective beginning in 2004. 25 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, "Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments." The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to its marketable equity securities, bond funds and other investments. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses such instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes. See Note G to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments. The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2003 consist of interest rate swaps entered into late in 2003, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt which is expected to reduce interest expense, given current interest rates. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations related to the United States dollar and the Great Britain pound. At December 31, 2003, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments. Based on the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 26
