ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the Companys views about its future performance and constitute "forward looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are 10 difficult to predict and, accordingly, the Companys actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. Readers should consider that various factors, including changes in general economic conditions and competitive market conditions; pricing pressures; relationships with key customers; industry consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and builders; shifts in distribution; the influence of e commerce; and other factors discussed in the "Executive Level Overview," "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Outlook for the Company" sections, may affect the Companys performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW The Company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products. These products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, builders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors. The Company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders in the new residential construction market. Factors that affect the Companys results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in North America and Europe (including repair and remodeling and new construction), the Companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure, fluctuations in European currencies (primarily the European euro and Great Britain pound), the importance of and the Companys relationships with home centers (including The Home Depot, which represented approximately 22 percent of the Companys sales in 2004) as distributors of home improvement and building products and the Companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition. Historically, the Company has been able to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in the new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company regularly reviews its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume based incentives. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On an on going basis, the Company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience. 11 Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates. FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS The Company maintains investments in marketable securities, which aggregated $263 million, and a number of private equity funds, which aggregated $308 million, at December 31, 2004. The investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period, or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions. The investments in marketable equity securities are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains and unrealized losses (that are deemed to be temporary) are recorded as a component of shareholders equity, net of tax effect, in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary. Future changes in market conditions, the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $21 million related to the Companys investment in Furniture Brands International (NYSE: FBN). The FBN common stock was received in June 2002 from the Companys investment in Furnishings International Inc. debt. Based on its review, the Company considers the decline in market value related to this investment to be other than temporary and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $21 million to reduce the cost basis from $30.25 per share to $25.05 per share; at December 31, 2004, the aggregate carrying value after the adjustment was $100 million. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the Company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each year, or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, the Company completes the impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method. This test for 2004 indicated that goodwill related to certain European businesses was impaired. The Company recognized a non cash, pre tax impairment charge of $168 million ($141 million, after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2004. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives. The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Companys judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in a different outcome. In estimating future cash flows, the Company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures and generally a three percent long term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast. The Company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes. 12 In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its business units were greater than the carrying values. Any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS Accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. Pension costs and obligations of the Company are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, compensation increases and discount rates for obligations. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. The Company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants, lawyers and actuaries. Changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the Companys consolidated financial statements in any given period. In 2004, the Company decreased its discount rate for obligations to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent, which reflects the decline in long term interest rates. The assumed asset return is 8.5 percent, reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets. The Companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to $193 million from $217 million in 2003. This is primarily the result of asset returns above projections and Company contributions. Qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2004 had a net gain of approximately 12 percent as compared with average returns of 10 percent for the largest 1,000 Plan Benchmark. The Companys projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans was $125 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $115 million at December 31, 2003. The Company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2005 to approximate such expense in 2004. If the Company assumed that the future return on plan assets was 8 percent instead of 8.5 percent, the pension expense for 2005 would increase by approximately $2 million. INCOME TAXES The Company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies, including the potential sale of certain operating assets, and identified potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004, particularly related to its after tax capital loss carryforward of $21 million and its after tax foreign tax credit carryforward of $50 million. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Changes to the U.S. tax law enacted in the fourth quarter of 2004 significantly impacted the taxation of foreign earnings distributions. As a result, the Company made a dividend distribution of accumulated earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries of approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Such earnings had been permanently reinvested, pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 under the Companys previous tax planning strategy to invest such earnings in operating and non operating foreign investments. This dividend generated significant foreign tax credits that were used to offset the majority of the U.S. tax on the 2004 dividend and created a $50 million foreign tax credit carryforward at December 31, 2004. The Company believes that the foreign tax credit carryforward will be utilized before the newly 13 enacted 10 year carryforward period expires on December 31, 2014, principally with identified potential sources of future income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates less than the present U.S. rate of 35 percent. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not recorded at December 31, 2004. Because the Company changed its position with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings, the Company recorded a $38 million deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily related to the excess of its book basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries. OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of the sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. The Company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims (including income taxes) with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel. When estimates of the Companys exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the Company may differ due to subsequent developments. See Note T to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company. The Company used estimates for the number of claims expected and the average cost per claim to determine the liability related to the Behr litigation settlement in 2002. In 2004, the Company estimated that the remaining unpaid claims and administration costs related to the Washington State Settlement would be less than originally estimated and reduced the related accrual (recognizing income) for litigation settlement by $20 million. INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Companys operations are highly decentralized and financial and transaction processing and control systems are distributed across the Companys multiple business units. The Company maintains monitoring controls through its group oversight function, a Company wide accounting policy manual and a well resourced internal audit function that works closely with an international accounting firm, which is not the Companys external auditor. Additionally, the Company believes it fosters an effective control environment through a strong corporate governance structure driven by the membership and activities of its Board of Directors and Audit Committee, its Code of Business Ethics and various Company wide programs related to legal and ethical compliance. In 2004, the Company conducted and concluded its first comprehensive evaluation of internal control over financial reporting under the new requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act"). During the course of this process, the Company determined that there was a lapse in controls associated with a business integration involving two of the Companys business units. Management concluded that the lapse in controls was a material weakness based on the potential for possible error and impact of such potential error on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, based on the requirements of the Act, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting did not operate effectively as of December 31, 2004. After extensive review and additional testing procedures that the Company considered appropriate under the circumstances, the Company determined that this material weakness condition did not result in a material misstatement in the Companys consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2004. 14 Management has taken a number of remediation steps and is in the process of taking additional steps associated with this matter as disclosed in Managements Remediation Plan in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to the incremental external costs and expenses of approximately $34 million (primarily professional fees) associated with complying with Section 404 of the Act, the Company has also invested significantly in training and additional infrastructure, including additional human resources, technological enhancements and process improvements. The Company believes it has incurred a disproportionate level of expense related to this initiative, relative to other companies of comparable size, due to its disaggregated business model. While the Companys decentralized operating structure and the number of autonomous business units serve to disperse risk, these factors also resulted in a more time consuming and costly environment for the Company to implement the requirements of the Act. The Company, with senior management actively involved, began its Section 404 implementation process in early 2003. The Companys compliance with the Section 404 requirements was highly complex and involved, given the continuing refinement of guidance related to the Acts requirements and the Companys decentralized operating structure, including disparate business systems, its relatively smaller foreign business units with different languages and cultures, and its installation services businesses with approximately 360 small branch locations. Nevertheless, the Company expects to continue to benefit from the implementation of the Acts requirements and is committed to a continuous improvement model of internal control, as evidenced through its significant investment of resources and its historic strong "tone at the top" philosophy of internal control. CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY Acquisitions in past years have enabled the Company to build a critical mass that has given the Company a strong position in the markets it serves and has increased the Companys importance to its customers. The Company is now intensifying its focus on leveraging the critical mass to build greater value for its shareholders. The Companys focus includes additional cost reduction initiatives as well as increased utilization of synergies among the Companys business units. The Company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy of internal growth, share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital. As part of its strategic planning, the Company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses are not core to continuing operations. The Company reviews its business portfolio on an ongoing basis as part of its corporate strategic planning and, in the first quarter of 2004, determined that several European businesses were not core to the Companys long term growth strategy and, accordingly, embarked on a plan of disposition. These businesses had combined 2003 net sales in excess of $350 million and an approximate net book value of $330 million. The Company originally estimated expected proceeds from the sale of these businesses to approximate $300 million. The Company reduced its estimate of expected proceeds during 2004 (recognizing pre tax charges of $139 million ($151 million, after tax) for those businesses expected to be divested at a loss) for these operations as a result of lower than expected operating results as well as a weaker than expected demand for the businesses that the Company planned to divest. Any gains resulting from the dispositions are recognized as such transactions are completed. The Company expects aggregate net proceeds to approximate $250 million upon completion of the dispositions, of which $172 million was received in 2004. During 2004, in separate transactions, the Company completed the sale of its Jung Pumpen, The Alvic Group, Alma Kuchen, E. Missel and SKS Group businesses in Europe. Jung Pumpen manufactures a wide variety of submersible and drainage pumps, The Alvic Group and Alma Kuchen manufacture kitchen cabinets, E. Missel manufactures acoustic insulation for baths and showers and SKS Group manufactures rolling shutters and ventilation systems; all of these businesses were included in discontinued operations. Total gross proceeds from the sale of these companies were $199 million, including cash of $193 million and notes receivable of $6 million. The Company recognized a pre tax, 15 net gain (principally related to the sale of Jung Pumpen) on the disposition of these businesses of $106 million. In 2003, the Company completed the sale of its Baldwin Hardware, Weiser Lock and Marvel Group businesses. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," the Company has accounted for the businesses held for sale at December 31, 2004 as well as businesses which were sold in 2004 and 2003 as discontinued operations. The sales and results of operations of the businesses sold in 2004 and 2003 and those held for sale at December 31, 2004 are included in the Companys results from discontinued operations through the date of disposition. During the time the Company owned these businesses, they had net sales of $357 million, $563 million and $589 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes of $29 million, $(43) million and $64 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations, long term bank debt and other borrowings, and by the issuance of Company common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. Bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds. At December 31, 2004, debt agreements with banks syndicated in the United States relate to a $2.0 billion 5 year Revolving Credit Agreement due and payable in November 2009. This agreement allows for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars or European euros. Interest is payable on borrowings under this agreement based on various floating rate options as selected by the Company. The previous 364 day revolving credit agreement expired in November 2004. Certain debt agreements contain limitations on additional borrowings; at December 31, 2004, the Company had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $3.9 billion. Certain debt agreements also contain a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth; at December 31, 2004, the Companys net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately $1.7 billion. In December 2002, the Company replenished the amount of debt and equity securities issuable under its unallocated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which the Company was able to issue up to a combined $2 billion of debt and equity securities. The Company had cash and cash investments of $1,256 million at December 31, 2004 as a result of strong cash flows from operations and proceeds from the disposition of certain businesses and financial investments. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company repatriated cash related to accumulated earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries to the United States of approximately $500 million. During 2004, the Company increased its quarterly common stock dividend 12.5 percent to $.18 per common share. This marks the 46th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. Although the Company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years, the Company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the Company. Maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the Companys financial strategies. The Companys total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 44 percent at December 31, 2004 from 43 percent at December 31, 2003. Repurchases and retirement of Company common stock contributed to the increase in the total debt to total capitalization ratio. The Companys working capital ratio was 2.1 to 1 and 1.7 to 1 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use derivatives for trading purposes. The derivatives used by the Company during the year ended 16 December 31, 2004 consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2004, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt, which is expected to reduce interest expense, given current interest rates. Generally, under interest rate swap agreements, the Company agrees with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges, and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement. For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings. The average variable interest rates are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a fixed adjustment factor. The average effective rate on the interest rate swaps is 3.302%. At December 31, 2004, the interest rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of $850 million of the Companys fixed rate debt due July 15, 2012 at an interest rate of 5.875%. The hedges are considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item. Accordingly, no gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The amount recognized as a reduction of interest expense was $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the United States dollar and the Great Britain pound. CASH FLOWS Significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions: 2004 2003 2002 Net cash from operating activities.......................... $1,454 $1,421 $1,225 (Decrease) increase in debt, net............................

Net cash provided by operations in 2004 of $1.5 billion consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $237 million, income of $30 million related to the Behr litigation settlement, a $168 million charge related to goodwill impairment, a 17 $21 million charge for the impairment of an investment and other items. Net working capital increased by approximately $10 million. The Company continues to emphasize balance sheet management, including working capital management and cash flow generation. Days sales in accounts receivable decreased to 49 days at December 31, 2004 from 53 days at December 31, 2003, and accounts payable days increased to 36 days at December 31, 2004 compared with 35 days at December 31, 2003, primarily due to the Companys working capital improvement initiatives. Days sales in inventories increased slightly to 49 days at December 31, 2004 from 48 days at December 31, 2003. Cash used for financing activities in 2004 was $1.1 billion, and included cash outflows of $302 million for cash dividends paid, $266 million for the retirement of notes, $903 million for the acquisition and retirement of Company common stock in open market transactions, $40 million for the acquisition of Company common stock for the Companys long term stock incentive award plan and $40 million principally for the net payment of other debt. Cash provided by financing activities included $293 million from the issuance of notes (net of issuance costs), $58 million from the issuance of Company common stock, primarily from the exercise of stock options and $55 million from interest rate swap transactions. At December 31, 2004, the Company had remaining Board of Directors authorization to repurchase up to an additional 17 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions or otherwise. In January and February 2005, the Company repurchased an additional six million shares of Company common stock (including approximately two million shares which were subsequently reissued for the long term stock incentive award plan) and expects to continue its Company common share repurchase program throughout 2005. Cash provided by investing activities was $161 million in 2004 and included $172 million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses and $330 million from the net sale of financial investments. Cash used for investing activities included $310 million for capital expenditures, $16 million for acquisitions and additional acquisition related consideration relating to previously acquired companies and $15 million for other net cash outflows. The Company expects to continue to monetize the marketable securities portfolio over the next several quarters. The Company continues to invest in automating its manufacturing operations and increasing its capacity and its productivity, in order to be a more efficient producer and to improve customer service. Capital expenditures for 2004 were $310 million, compared with $271 million for 2003 and $285 million for 2002; for 2005, capital expenditures, excluding those of any potential 2005 acquisitions, are expected to approximate $400 million. Capital expenditures for 2005 include significant capacity additions to the Companys North American cabinet operations for which construction is anticipated to commence in 2005 and to be completed in 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2004 totaled $237 million, compared with $244 million for 2003 and $220 million for 2002; for 2005, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2005 acquisitions, is expected to approximate $240 million. Amortization expense totaled $26 million, $32 million and $39 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor in the opinion of the Company are they expected to have, a material effect on the Companys capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that its present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its near term working capital and other investment needs. The Company believes that its longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings, future financial market activities and proceeds from asset sales. 18 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States. However, the Company believes that certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results. SALES AND OPERATIONS Net sales for 2004 were $12.1 billion, representing an increase of 14 percent over 2003. Excluding results from acquisitions, net sales also increased 14 percent (including a two percent increase relating to the effect of currency translation) compared with 2003. The increase in net sales in 2004 is principally due to higher unit sales volumes of assembled cabinets, architectural coatings, installation services, vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors, and faucets. The following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2004 2003 Net sales, as reported...................................... $12,074 $10,571 Acquisitions............................................ (46) Net sales, excluding acquisitions........................... 12,028 10,571 Currency translation.................................... (209) Net sales, excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency.................................................. $11,819 $10,571 The Companys gross profit margins were 30.8 percent, 30.7 percent and 31.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the 2004 gross profit margins reflects increased sales volume and increased selling prices, offset in part by increased commodity costs as well as sales in segments with somewhat lower gross margins. In addition, operating results for the year ended December 31, 2003 were reduced by non cash, pre tax charges of $59 million relating to two United Kingdom business units, one in the Decorative Architectural Products segment and the other in the Plumbing Products segment. Offsetting the charges related to these United Kingdom business units, operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 also benefited from $72 million of Behr litigation income. Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $30 million of Behr litigation income. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding general corporate expense, as a percent of sales were 15.0 percent in 2004 compared with 15.7 percent in 2003 and 14.6 percent in 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the effect of lower promotion and advertising costs as a percent of sales, compared with 2003. This reduction was partially offset by increased costs and expenses associated with complying with the new requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Legislation as well as increased expenses associated with stock options. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 include $16 million of accelerated benefit expense related to the unexpected passing of the Companys President and Chief Operating Officer. Operating profit margins, as reported, were 13.0 percent, 14.0 percent and 14.3 percent in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating profit margins, excluding general corporate expense, the income/charge for litigation settlement (2004, 2003 and 2002), the goodwill impairment charge (2004 and 2003), and income from the planned disposition of a business (2002), were 15.7 percent, 14.9 percent and 17.0 percent in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 19 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $21 million, $19 million and $24 million, respectively, of non cash, pre tax charges for the write down of certain financial investments. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized the above mentioned impairment charge of $21 million related to the Companys investment in Furniture Brands International (NYSE: FBN). The FBN common stock was received in June 2002 from the Companys investment in Furnishings International Inc. debt. Based on its review, the Company considers the decline in market value related to this investment to be other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge to reduce the cost basis from $30.25 per share to $25.05 per share; the aggregate carrying value after the adjustment is $100 million. Other, net in 2004 includes $50 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $27 million and $42 million of income, net, from other investments. Other, net in 2004 also includes realized foreign currency exchange gains of $26 million and other miscellaneous items. Other, net in 2003 includes $23 million of realized gains, net, from the sale of marketable equity securities, dividend income of $25 million and $17 million of income, net, from other investments. Other, net in 2003 also includes a $5 million gain from the sale of the Companys equity investment in Emco, $7 million of losses on the early retirement of debt, realized foreign currency exchange losses of $4 million and other miscellaneous items. Other, net in 2002 includes $39 million of realized losses, net, from the sale of marketable equity securities and dividend income of $17 million. In addition, the Company incurred $14 million of losses related to interest ratelock transactions entered into in anticipation of the Company issuing fixed rate debt in 2002. Other items, net, in 2002 include realized foreign currency exchange losses of $3 million and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense was $217 million, $261 million and $235 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 is primarily due to debt retirement as well as the effect of the interest rate swap agreements that converted a certain amount of fixed rate debt to lower variable rate debt and reduced interest expense by $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2004 were $930 million and $2.04 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2004 includes a non cash, pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $168 million ($141 million, after tax) and income related to the Behr litigation settlement of $30 million pre tax ($19 million, after tax). Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2003 were $790 million and $1.61 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2003 includes a non cash, pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $53 million ($47 million, after tax) and income related to the Behr litigation settlement of $72 million pre tax ($45 million, after tax). Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share for 2002 were $639 million and $1.24 per common share, respectively. Income from continuing operations in 2002 was negatively affected by a $147 million pre tax charge for the Behr litigation settlement ($92 million, after tax). The Companys effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 37 percent in 2004 and 2003 compared with 34 percent in 2002. The increase in the tax rate in 2004 and 2003 was due principally to a lower tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charges. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 35 percent for 2005. 20 OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY The Company experienced significant commodity cost increases during 2004, which reduced expected gross margins, including in the fourth quarter. Higher commodity costs reflecting cost increases in 2004 and additional cost increases in 2005 are expected to impact 2005 first half results. The Company already has implemented and continues to implement additional selling price increases on a number of its products, and believes that by the end of the second quarter, many of these commodity cost increases will be largely offset by such price increases. The Company believes that the impact of the delay in offsetting these recent cost increases with increased selling prices, and the shortage of certain materials will negatively impact earnings in the first half of 2005, largely in the first quarter. This impact has been reflected in the Companys previously announced guidance. The Company believes that it will achieve further organic sales growth in 2005, and, based on current business trends, believes that it will achieve mid to high single digit organic growth in 2005 resulting in record sales and earnings. The Company expects its 2005 operating results to be impacted by a decline in housing starts of five percent from 2004 levels, share repurchases of a minimum 12 million common shares, modest margin improvement reflecting selling price increases and anticipated income from the sale of financial investments. In addition, the Company is assuming no further significant commodity cost increases beyond what it has already experienced in early 2005. 21 BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS The following table sets forth the Companys net sales and operating profit information by business segment and geographic area, dollars in millions.

The 2003 goodwill impairment charge was as follows: Plumbing Products $17 million; Decorative Architectural Products $5 million; and Other Specialty Products $31 million. These 2004 and 2003 charges relate to European businesses. 22 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION Changes in operating profit margins in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results discussion exclude general corporate expense, the income/charge for the litigation settlement, net in 2004, 2003 and 2002, and the goodwill impairment charges in 2004 and 2003. CABINETS AND RELATED PRODUCTS Net sales of Cabinets and Related Products increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 and 9 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The sales increases are due primarily to increased sales volume of assembled cabinets largely through North American retail distribution channels at major home centers and through the new construction market in the United States, as well as a more favorable product mix. This segment was also favorably influenced by a weaker U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, which affected the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 16.8 percent, 15.3 percent and 13.9 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2004 reflect the positive impact of higher sales volume as well as certain cost improvement initiatives. Operating profit margins in 2003 reflect the positive effect of higher sales volume as well as lower fixed costs resulting from the rationalization of existing manufacturing capacity. Operating profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by strong sales volume, offset in part by costs related to a discontinued product line. PLUMBING PRODUCTS Net sales of Plumbing Products increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased sales volume in the retail markets in North America and Europe and in the new construction markets in North America. Net sales of Plumbing Products increased 30 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to acquisitions (principally the acquisition of the majority interest in Hansgrohe in December 2002). A weaker U.S. dollar also had a favorable impact on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment in 2004 and 2003. Operating profit margins were 12.9 percent, 13.4 percent and 16.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in European sales (which are generally at lower margins) as well as increased material costs, offset in part by increased sales volume. Operating profit margins in 2003 include the effect of an acquired company that has lower margins than the segment average as well as inventory adjustments and a decline in operating margins of certain European operations. Operating profit margins in 2002 include the favorable effect of a $16 million pre tax gain relating to the reclassification of certain assets to held and used in accordance with SFAS No. 144. During 2003, the Company detected that an employee at a United Kingdom business unit in the Plumbing Products segment had circumvented internal controls and overstated operating results by approximately $4 million in 2002. This overstatement was corrected in the third quarter of 2003. The Company made the appropriate personnel changes and completed its review of the business unit in the fourth quarter of 2003 and determined that no further adjustment was necessary. INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES Net sales of Installation and Other Services increased 15 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 and 31 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in net sales in 2004 is primarily due to increased selling prices, increased sales volume of non insulation products and a strong new housing market. The increase in net sales in 2003 was principally attributable to acquisitions (principally the acquisition of Service Partners in September 2002) and a stronger new housing market as well as increased sales volume of non insulation products. Operating profit margins were 12.9 percent, 15.3 percent and 16.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in the 2004 operating profit margins is 23 primarily attributable to the time lag in implementing price increases related to material cost increases as well as an increase in sales of generally lower margin, non insulation products. Historically, the Company has generally been able to increase its selling prices to reflect certain material cost increases. However, the Company has not yet been able to increase selling prices to offset all such cost increases, contributing to a decline in operating profit margins. The decline in operating profit margins in 2003 is primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions (which reduced sales) experienced in the first half of 2003 as well as increased sales of generally lower margin, non insulation products. Within the Installation and Other Services segment, the availability of fiberglass insulation to support the Companys installation and distribution activities was constrained throughout 2004. The high level of demand for fiberglass insulation as a result of the strength of the new residential construction market has outpaced the industrys capacity to produce additional product. The Company believes that these conditions will persist in 2005 and is working with its diverse supplier base to secure the appropriate amount of material. At the current time, the Company believes that it will be able to do so, but if the Company cannot obtain the required amount of material, this could have a negative impact on its operations. DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS Net sales of Decorative Architectural Products increased 11 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, and 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increases in net sales in 2004 and 2003 are primarily due to higher unit sales volume of paints and stains as well as increased sales of decorative hardware. Operating profit margins were 20.6 percent, 14.8 percent and 23.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The margin improvement in 2004 includes the effect of increased sales volume of paints and stains and increased sales volume and improved operating performance of the Companys decorative hardware businesses, offset in part by increased material and promotion costs. Operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were impacted by increased advertising costs, including additional costs associated with new in store paint display centers, and fixed asset and inventory adjustments reflecting excess, obsolete and resourced products related to decorative hardware. As previously discussed, operating profit in this segment for 2003 was negatively affected by non cash, pre tax charges of $55 million related to a United Kingdom business unit. The charges relate primarily to a business system implementation failure which allowed former management of the business unit to circumvent internal controls and artificially inflate the units operating profit in years prior to 2003. The operating profit margins in 2002 reflect the leveraging of fixed costs over higher unit sales volume. OTHER SPECIALTY PRODUCTS Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased 17 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, principally due to increased sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and doors in North America. Net sales of Other Specialty Products increased 17 percent in 2003 compared with 2002, principally due to acquisitions as well as increased sales of vinyl windows. A weaker U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003 also had a favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of European operations included in this segment. Operating profit margins were 19.2 percent, 18.2 percent and 19.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The margin improvement in 2004 is primarily attributable to increased sales volume of windows. The lower operating profit margins in 2003 are primarily due to increased material and insurance costs as well as lower results of European operations. The operating profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by acquisitions, which in aggregate had higher operating profit margins than the segment average. 24 GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS DISCUSSION NORTH AMERICA Net sales from North American operations increased 13 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, and 14 percent in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily due to increased unit sales volume of assembled cabinets, faucets, installed sales of insulation and non insulation products, paints and stains, and vinyl and fiberglass windows and doors. Operating profit margins were 16.6 percent, 16.4 percent and 17.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of assembled cabinets, faucets, paints and stains, vinyl and fiberglass windows and doors and installed sales of insulation and non insulation products. Operating profit margins for 2004 were negatively impacted by increased commodity costs, which offset lower sales promotion costs. The decline in operating profit margins for 2003 principally reflect increased sales in segments that have somewhat lower operating profit margins, increased commodity and energy costs as well as increased advertising and promotion costs. The operating profit margins for 2002 principally reflect the leveraging of fixed costs over increased sales volume and product mix. INTERNATIONAL, PRINCIPALLY EUROPE Net sales of the Companys International operations increased 21 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, due to increased local currency sales of plumbing products, ready to assemble cabinets and windows. Net sales of the Companys International operations increased 58 percent in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily due to acquisitions. A weaker U.S. dollar had a positive effect on the translation of European results in 2004 and 2003, increasing European net sales in 2004 by approximately 12 percent and in 2003 by 16 percent. Operating profit margins were 11.6 percent, 8.8 percent and 14.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating profit margins for 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of plumbing products, ready to assemble cabinets and windows. Operating profit margins for International operations for 2003 were adversely affected by the non cash, pre tax charges relating to accounting irregularities discussed previously, as well as lower margins of recently acquired companies. OTHER MATTERS COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation Information regarding legal proceedings involving the Company is set forth in Note T to the consolidated financial statements. Other Commitments With respect to the Companys investments in private equity funds, the Company, at December 31, 2004, has, under certain circumstances, commitments to contribute additional capital to such funds of up to $123 million. During 2000, approximately 300 of the Companys key employees purchased from the Company 8.4 million shares of Company common stock for cash totaling $156 million under an Executive Stock Purchase Program ("Program"). The stock was purchased at $18.50 per share, the approximate market price of the common stock at the time of purchase. Participants in the Program financed their purchases with five year full recourse personal loans, at a market interest rate, from a bank syndicate. Each participant is fully responsible at all times for repaying their bank loans when they become due and is personally responsible for 100 percent of any loss in the market value of the purchased stock. 25 The Company has guaranteed repayment of the loans, for which the aggregate amount outstanding was approximately $47 million at December 31, 2004, only in the event of a default by a participant. The Company believes that the likelihood of any significant defaults by participants on payment of these loans, which are due in mid 2005, is remote. The Company enters into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates. Such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to the Companys products and workmanship. In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company occasionally provides reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; provisions for sales returns; and asset valuations. The Company has never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and evaluates the probability that amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when probable. Warranty Certain of the Companys products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product. At the time of sale, the Company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. The Companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly. See Note T to the consolidated financial statements for the tabular disclosure. A significant portion of the Companys business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. A consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. However, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the Company. The Companys revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table provides payment obligations related to current contracts at December 31, 2004, in millions: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 2 3 4 5 MORE THAN 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL Long term debt.......................... $ 80 $2,242 $117 $1,828 $4,267 Operating leases........................ 115 146 41 113 415 Private equity funds.................... 41 41 41 123 Acquisition related commitments......... 20 20 Defined benefit plans................... 13 13 Purchase commitments (A)................ 143 7 150 Total......................... $412 $2,436 $199 $1,941 $4,988 (A) Does not include contracts that do not require volume commitments or open or pending purchase orders. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue Summary No. 04 08, "Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share" became effective. EITF No. 04 08 would have required the Company to include 26 24 million shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share related to the Companys Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 ("Notes"), with the add back of the related interest expense to net income. In December 2004, the Company exchanged the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes ("Old Notes") for Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes ("New Notes"). The New Notes have substantially the same terms as the Old Notes, except that upon conversion of the New Notes, the Company will pay the conversion price, up to the accreted value of the New Notes, in cash, and any value greater than the accreted value will be settled in cash or shares of Company common stock, at the option of the Company. At December 31, 2004, the Company included approximately one million shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share as the price of the Company common stock at December 31, 2004 exceeded the accreted value of the New Notes. In the first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 Revised ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN 46R requires that a company that is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in the companys financial statements. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 123 ("SFAS No. 123R"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," which supersedes Accounting Principles Bulletin ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure and recognize the cost (fair value) of employee services received in exchange for stock options. SFAS No. 123R also clarifies and expands guidance in several areas including measuring fair value and classification of employee stock based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2005 using the Modified Prospective Application ("MPA"). The MPA method does not require restatement of prior year information and will require the Company to expense unvested stock options that were awarded prior to January 1, 2003 through their remaining vesting periods. The Company expects this additional expense to approximate $10 million in 2005. The Company has been using the fair value method for options granted, modified or settled subsequent to January 1, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the other provisions of SFAS No. 123R will have on its consolidated financial statements. 27 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company has considered the provisions of Financial Reporting Release No. 48, "Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments." The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to its marketable equity securities and other investments. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses such instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes. See Note G to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Companys derivative instruments. The derivatives used by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2004 consist of interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2003 and 2004, for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt, which is expected to reduce interest expense, given current interest rates. Certain of the Companys European operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the United States dollar and the Great Britain pound. At December 31, 2004, the Company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 200 basis points in average interest rates, a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the Companys long term investments. Based on the analyses performed, such changes would not be expected to materially affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 28
